Battle-tested Japanese industrial managers here always buck up nervous newcomers with the tale of the first of their countrymen to visit Mexico, a boatload of samurai warriors blown ashore 375 years ago. 

"From the beginning, it took a man with extraordinary qualities to succeed in Mexico," says Kimihide Takimura, president of Mitsui group's Kensetsu Engineering Inc. unit. 

Here in this new center for Japanese assembly plants just across the border from San Diego, turnover is dizzying, infrastructure shoddy, bureaucracy intense.
Even after-hours drag; "karaoke" bars, where Japanese revelers sing over recorded music, are prohibited by Mexico's powerful musicians union. 

Still, 20 Japanese companies, including giants such as Sanyo Industries Corp., Matsushita Electronics Components Corp. and Sony Corp. have set up shop in the state of Northern Baja California.
Keeping the Japanese happy will be one of the most important tasks facing conservative leader Ernesto Ruffo when he takes office Nov. 1, as the first opposition governor in Mexico's modern history. 

Mexico, with its desperate need for investment, and Japan, with its huge budget surplus, would seem like a perfect match.
But the two countries remain separated by a cultural barrier wider than the ocean.
Conservative Japanese investors are put off by what they consider Mexico's restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits.
From the Mexicans' viewpoint, vaunted tactics of methodical Japanese managers don't count for much in a land where a saying says "there are no fixed rules." 

Japan ranks as only the fourth largest foreign investor in Mexico, with 5% of the total investments.
That is just 1% of all the money Japan has invested abroad. 

Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari would like to change that.
The young president so admires Japanese discipline that he sends his children to a Japanese school in Mexico City.
He already has finagled a $2 billion loan from the Japanese government. 

But Mexico urgently needs more help.
Mr. Salinas's unpopular Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, faces congressional elections in 1991.
For the PRI to stand a chance, Mr. Salinas has to press on with an economic program that so far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth.
But maintaining the key components of his strategy -- a stable exchange rate and high level of imports -- will consume enormous amounts of foreign exchange.
Mr. Salinas needs big investment inflows -- quickly. 

The problem is that Japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming months that weigh so heavily on Mr. Salinas. "The Japanese will come to Mexico, but not immediately," says Kazushige Suzuki, director-general of the Japanese External Trade Organization in Mexico.
If not now, when? "When the fruit is ripe, it falls from the tree by itself," he says.
Pressed on the matter, he is more specific. "There will be big Japanese investments probably five to 10 years from now." 

Ryukichi Imai, Japan's ambassador to Mexico, agrees that Mexico may be too eager.  "There seems to be a presumption in some sectors of (Mexico's) government that there is a lot of Japanese money waiting behind the gate, and that by slightly opening the gate, that money will enter Mexico.  I don't think that is the case."

Mexican officials maintain the Japanese reserve is only a result of unfamiliarity. "Because of distance, it takes a while for them to appreciate the economic stability we've achieved," says one economic policymaker.
Mexico is sending a number of missions to Japan looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications, petrochemicals or tourism.
It is hoped that other Japanese would then follow the leader. 

But Japanese investors say that their reluctance to invest stems not only from concerns about Mexico's economic outlook, but also reservations about Mexico's recently revamped investment law.
Unable to get a new law through a congress with a strong leftist bloc, Mexico jury-rigged the existing law's regulations.
It created special 20-year trusts to allow foreigners 100% ownership in some once-closed industries.
It also made artful use of semantics, redefining as non-strategic industries some that had been in the national domain. 

"Those devices don't give sufficient certainty to our bosses in Japan," says Yasuo Nakamura, representative of the Industrial Bank of Japan.
Mr. Nakamura cites the case of a customer who wants to build a giant tourism complex in Baja and has been trying for eight years to get around Mexican restrictions on foreign ownership of beachfront property.
He could develop the beach through a trust, but instead is trying have his grandson become a naturalized Mexican so his family gains direct control. 

Some say the best hope for the Mexicans is catching the eye of Japan by promoting the one industry the Japanese clearly like -- the border assembly plants, known as "maquiladoras," which are open to 100% foreign control. 

"We must do more to help the Japanese here in Baja if we want them to invest elsewhere," says Mr. Ruffo, the governor-elect of the National Action Party and himself a succesful businessman.
Plant operators are heartened by Mr. Ruffo's pledge to cut corruption associated with the ruling party officials.
But Mr. Ruffo frets that an even bigger problem could be protectionism from the U.S., where some politicians oppose what they consider Japanese efforts to use maquiladoras to crack the U.S. market through the back door. 

 

Farm prices in October edged up 0.7% from September as raw milk prices continued their rise, the Agriculture Department said. 

Milk sold to the nation's dairy plants and dealers averaged $14.50 for each hundred pounds, up 50 cents from September and up $1.50 from October 1988, the department said. 

Commercial vegetables, led by lettuce and tomatoes, rose 19% in October; oranges and other fruits rose 5%. 

Broiler prices fell 6.5 cents in October to 30.6 cents a pound, while turkey prices rose 1.2 cents a pound to 38.5 cents.
Egg prices averaged 64.2 cents a dozen, down 0.2 cent from September. 

Hogs rose $3.40 to $46.80 a hundredweight in October, while beef cattle slipped 80 cents to $67.40 for each hundred pounds and calves dropped 90 cents to $90.20. 

Soybeans averaged $5.28 a bushel, down 42 cents from September; corn averaged $2.20, down seven cents, and sorghum grain averaged $3.61 for each hundred pounds, down 19 cents, according to the department. 

 

Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded about $970 million of senior debt of Arkla Inc. in response to the company's increased financial leverage, related primarily to restructuring plans that include taking a $189 million charge. 

Moody's contends the natural gas company's debt has risen principally because of large prepayments to producers to settle take-or-pay claims, and due to aggressive efforts to increase market opportunities through acquisitions, which were partially financed by debt. 

Arkla is based in Shreveport, La. 

Downgraded by the ratings concern are Arkla's first mortgage bonds to single-A-3 from single-A-2; notes to single-A-3 from single-A-2; debentures to single-A-3 from single-A-2; shelf registration to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2; convertible preferred stock to Baa-1 from single-A-3, and the concern's rating for commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
Also downgraded were the company's Entex Inc. unit's first mortgage bonds to single-A-3 from single-A-2 and debentures to single-A-3 from single-A-2.
Arkla acquired Entex in 1988. 

Moody's said the rating action takes into account Arkla's plan for an initial public offering of as much as 18% of the common stock of its oil and gas exploration and development subsidiary, proceeds of which will be used to repay debt. 

Sea Containers Ltd., in a long-awaited move to repel a hostile takeover bid, said it will sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece. 

Together with the 3.6 million shares currently controlled by management, subsidiaries and directors, the completed tender offer would give Sea Containers a controlling stake. 

Describing itself as "asset rich," Sea Containers said it will move immediately to sell two ports, various ferries, ferry services, containers, and other investments.
Of the proceeds, $500 million will be used to fund its tender offer.
Sea Containers added that the recapitalization plan will reduce its debt by more than $500 million. 

The company, which has 13.8 million common shares outstanding, said in mid-June that it was considering a restructuring to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns.
In late May, Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC, launched a $50-a-share, or $777 million, tender offer for the Hamilton, Bermuda-based Sea Containers.
In mid-August, the companies, through their jointly owned holding company, Temple Holdings Ltd., sweetened the offer to $63 a share, or $963 million. 

Officials for Temple declined to comment. 

News of the restructuring plan sent Sea Containers' shares up $1 to $62 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Walter Kirchberger, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said that offering holders a higher, $70-a-share price is "a fairly effective method of blocking" the Stena-Tiphook bid.
Michael Carstens, an analyst with Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day, added that the sale of assets would allow Sea Containers to focus on its core container businesses. 

For holders who decide not to tender their shares, Sea Containers will issue one share of preferred stock with a stated value of $25, plus a cash dividend on the common stock.
The company said its directors, management and subsidiaries will remain long-term investors and won't tender any of their shares under the offer. 

Sea Containers said the offer will proceed after the Bermuda Supreme Court lifts or modifies an interim injunction restraining the company from buying its shares.
That injunction resulted from litigation between Temple and Sea Containers last May. 

The company said the court has indicated it will make a decision on or about Nov. 27.
Sea Containers will soon set a date for its annual shareholder meeting to seek holder approval for the offer. 

Four Seasons Hotels Inc. announced a 2-for-1 stock split and said it plans to increase its annual dividend. 

Separately, the hotel chain posted a 13% increase in third-quarter earnings to 3.4 million Canadian dollars (US$2.89 million), or 34 Canadian cents, compared with C$3 million, or 31 Canadian cents.
Revenue for the quarter fell 6% to C$50.4 million, from C$53.7 million the year earlier. 

The company said it approved an increase in its annual dividend rate to 22 Canadian cents, from 19 Canadian cents.
The dividend will be paid semiannually, although pay and record dates haven't yet been determined. 

A company spokeswoman said the stock split, planned for Jan. 8, is intended to increase trading in the stock.
On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Four Seasons gained C$1.50 to C$35.75 in light trading.
The company currently has 7.2 million subordinate voting shares outstanding. 

The company also said Isadore Sharp, chairman and president, plans to terminate his option to acquire 500,000 shares so they can be distributed to senior executives under a proposed incentive plan.
In return, the company would reimburse Mr. Sharp in the event of any future sale of control of the company.
The Toronto Stock Exchange limits the number of options a company can issue to employees. 

The incentive plan is subject to approval by a majority of holders of the subordinate voting shares, other than Mr. Sharp and his associates, at a special meeting to be held Dec. 19. 

The Four Seasons spokeswoman said Mr. Sharp, who has an 81% voting stake in the company, has no current plans to sell his interest.
She said Mr. Sharp's stake won't be diluted by the stock split. 

For the first nine months of the year, net rose 12% to 9.2 million Canadian dollars, or 93 Canadian cents a share, compared with C$8.2 million, or 84 Canadian cents a share.
Revenue fell to C$148 million from C$162.3 million. 

Mitsubishi Estate Co., a major developer and property owner in Japan, has agreed to pay $846 million to acquire a 51% stake in Rockefeller Group Inc., Rockefeller officials said. 

Rockefeller Group owns the 22-acre, 19-building Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan.
Mitsubishi is a partner in Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles and Pacwest Center in Portland, Ore., and owns most of the land beneath Tokyo's Marunouchi central business district, often referred to as the Rockefeller Center of Tokyo. 

In 1985, Rockefeller Group sold a mortgage on the core of Rockefeller Center to the public in the form of a real estate investment trust.
The trust has an option to convert its shares to a 71.5% equity stake in the center by the year 2000.
Analysts say a sale of Rockefeller Group shares should not affect the trust's value. 

If the trust exercises its option as expected, Mitsubishi will gain only a minority stake in the most prestigious section of the center, which was built during the Great Depression.
Among the Rockefeller Group holdings not encumbered by the trust are the Time & Life building, a majority stake in the McGraw-Hill building, a prime development site on the Manhattan's West Side and certain development rights. 

Sources familiar with the transaction say officials at some Rockefeller units are unhappy with the deal.
Managers of Rockefeller's Cushman & Wakefield Inc., a national real estate brokerage, have reportedly structured a company buy-out plan which was rejected by its parent.
Cushman President Arthur J. Mirante II had no comment on reports of the buy-out effort or the Mitsubishi acquisition.
But the sources say Rockefeller was seeking at least $200 million for the real estate services firm, a price that would make a buy-out impractical for the managers.
Cushman's management is made up of top brokers who are considered the firm's major asset and whose cooperation is regarded as vital to its success.
Sources estimate Cushman will have 1989 revenue of more than $275 million. 

Rockefeller Group said in September it would seek investors to purchase as much as 80% of the firm, a holding company for Rockefeller family interests.
Mitsubishi has agreed to acquire 627,000 shares of Rockefeller common stock held by trusts established by John D. Rockefeller in 1934. 

When people "understand the resources of Mitsubishi they'll see it represents an exciting future for the company," said Richard A. Voell, president of Rockefeller Group. 

William G. Bowen, chairman of the committee that oversees the family trusts, said the deal meets the committee's objective of diversification of the family's assets. 

David Rockefeller, chairman of Rockefeller Group, said the company talked with many potential investors in Japan, the United States and Europe.
But Mr. Rockefeller said he has a 20-year association with Mitsubishi from his days as chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp. 

Koyata Hosokawa, executive vice president of Mitsubishi, said the company has spent years studying the U.S. real estate market. 

Sources say Rockefeller Group had distributed a "fact book" to international real estate investors including Mitsui Real Estate Development Co. of Japan and Canada's Olympia & York Developments Ltd. 

Before yesterday's announcement, many observers wondered whether a Japanese buyer would be willing to acquire a piece of such high-profile American real estate.
It is understood that Japanese buyers shied from bidding on the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago because purchasing the world's tallest building might stir anti-Japanese sentiments in the U.S. 

Rockefeller Group's management unit will continue to manage Rockefeller Center, a stipulation insisted upon by Rockefeller Group. 

Dillard Department Stores Inc. said that stockholders at a special meeting approved an amendment to increase the authorized shares of its Class A and Class B common stock. 

The company said that authorized Class A common shares will increase to 144.5 million from 76.8 million and the authorized Class B common will increase to 5.5 million from 3.2 million shares. 

MCI Communications Corp. said it won a $27 million contract from Stuart-James Co., a Denver investment banking concern, to provide voice and data telecommunications services. 

The agreement calls for MCI to provide data service, 800 and Vnet service, a virtual private network service.
The companies wouldn't disclose the length of the contract except to say it was a multiyear agreement. 

Paramount Communications Inc. said it sold two Simon & Schuster information services units to Macmillan Inc., a subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corp. 

The two units are Prentice Hall Information Services, which publishes tax, financial planning and business law information, among other services, and Prentice Hall Information Network, which electronically delivers tax information. 

Terms weren't disclosed, but industry executives said the units were sold for $40 million. 

Arthur H. Rosenfeld, previously president of the Prentice Hall Tax and Professional Services division, was named president of the newly formed Macmillan Professional and Business Reference division. 

Simon & Schuster retains the Corporation Law looseleaf service, which will become part of its Prentice Hall Law & Business unit. 

Shares closed sharply higher in London in the year's thinnest volume Monday, supported largely by a technical bounce after last week's sharp declines. 

Tokyo stocks posted a second-consecutive loss Monday, while trading in Frankfurt, West Germany, was mixed. 

In London, the Financial Times 100-share index finished 30.1 points higher at 2112.2.
The index settled off the high of 2117.1 posted after Wall Street opened stronger.
But it showed strength throughout the session, hitting a low of only 2102.2 within the first few minutes of dealings. 

The 30-share index settled 23.2 points higher at 1701.7.
Volume was only 256.6 million shares, breaking the previous 1989 low of 276.8 million shares recorded Oct. 23.
Turnover was also down substantially from 840.8 million shares on Friday. 

Dealers said the market was supported to some extent by a firmer pound, gains on Wall Street and shopping by market-makers to cover internal requirements for selected stocks in the 100-share index. 

Dealers attributed most of the day's gains to market-makers moving prices higher, rather than an outbreak of significant buying interest.
Prices were up across the board, with most blue-chip stocks registering solid gains. 

Though the market was stronger, dealers said fresh buying interest was sidelined ahead of a potential market-affecting debate in the House of Commons set for Tuesday.
It will be Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's first appearance before the opposition Labor Party.
The market is keenly interested in hearing what he has to say about the status of the current 15% base lending rate. 

In London trading, Courtaulds, a chemicals and textiles company, increased 15 pence to 362 after it disclosed plans to spin off its textiles operations into a separately listed company on Jan. 1.
It was the most active of the 100-share index at 8.3 million shares, 6.5 million of which were traded by midday. 

Jaguar ended 22 higher at 747.
Dealers said fresh buying was drawn into Jaguar after a senior executive of Daimler-Benz, the auto maker, told a British television interviewer during the weekend that the West German company held talks with the luxury auto maker over possible joint ventures.
Although Daimler has said it isn't interested in mounting a bid for Jaguar, dealers said its name further underlined the growing interest in the British concern. 

Glaxo was the biggest gainer, jumping 35 to #13.78 ($21.72) on anticipation of a stock split next week.
Total turnover in Glaxo was a thin 975,000 shares. 

In Tokyo, stocks had a second-consecutive loss Monday in quiet trading with the exception of concentrated buying in some incentive-backed issues. 

The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues fell 109.85 points to 35417.44. 

The index fell 151.20 Friday. 

In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index rose 35.28 points to 35452.72. 

On Monday, volume on the First Section was estimated at 600 million shares, down from 1.24 billion shares Friday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 551 to 349; 224 issues were unchanged.
Investors, who took profits Friday, mostly took a wait-and-see attitude Monday amid uncertainty in the foreign-currency market and New York stocks, traders said. 

Takamori Matsuda, an analyst at Dresdner-ABD Securities, said fading expectation for lower interest rates made investors step back from real-estate shares, which advanced last week.
Some traders said institutions were waiting to see the U.S. jobless rate to be issued Friday. 

The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section, which fell 15.82 points Friday, was down 5.16 points, or 0.19%, at 2676.60.
The Second Section index, which fell 36.87 points Friday, was down 21.44 points, or 0.59%, to close at 3636.06.
Second Section volume was estimated at 15 million shares, down from 24.5 million shares Friday. 

Monday's losers included railway, electric-utility and high-technology issues. 

The energy of participating investors streamed into Tokyu Group shares, pushing prices of its companies up across the board.
Tokyu Group announced during the weekend that each Group company will buy the others' stocks to defend themselves against a rumored takeover.
The announcement fueled speculation for future advances in the shares.
Tokyu Department Store advanced 260 to 2410.
Tokyu Corp. was up 150 at 2890.
Tokyu Construction gained 170 to 1610. 

Other winners Monday included nonferrous metals, which attracted investors because of a surge in gold prices on the back of the unstable dollar.
Petroleum companies were also popular because of expectations of a weaker dollar, which cuts dollar-denominated crude-oil prices. 

Share prices in Frankfurt closed narrowly mixed after listless and directionless trading.
The DAX index closed at 1466.29, up only 3.36. 

Traders said turnover was particularly thin as investors waited for Wall Street to set the direction for the week.
Most expect the decline in New York stock prices to continue this week. 

Another factor weighing on the Frankfurt market involves fears about the impending wage talks between the IG Metall metal-workers union and industry representatives, which could result in a wave of strikes next spring, traders said. 

A few blue-chip stocks posted strong gains, boosted by special factors, while the majority of shares ended little changed. 

Elsewhere, stock prices were lower in Brussels, Milan and Stockholm, and mixed in Amsterdam, Paris and Zurich. 

Stocks closed higher in Hong Kong, Manila, Seoul, Sydney, Taipei and Wellington, but were lower in Singapore. 

Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
The percentage change is since year-end. 

Santa Fe Pacific was the kind of story Wall Street loved. 

Since the value of its assets wasn't known, analysts were free to pick a number.
In one of many rosy scenarios, Bear Stearns's Gary Schneider wrote in March that its real estate alone had a value of $4.5 billion.
Throw in its railroad, minerals, pipeline and oil assets, he and others argued, and the Chicago-based conglomerate should be worth 30 a share. 

And why should holders expect to realize that presumed "worth?" That was another reason the Street loved Santa Fe.
With real estate experts Olympia & York and Samuel Zell's Itel owning close to 40% of Santa Fe's stock, management was under pressure -- in a favored phrase of Wall Street -- to quickly "maximize values." 

But value, it turns out, is only what a buyer will pay.
And with the company's recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate, the values suddenly look poorer. 

Santa Fe has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a 20% interest in its real estate unit to the California Public Employees Retirement System for roughly $400 million.
Since the real estate unit also includes debt, the imputed value of the real estate itself is close to $3 billion. 

"The implied current net asset value of 22.70 {per share} is well below the 30 level that the Street believed," PaineWebber says. "The upside was in the intangible real estate . . . which is no longer an intangible." 

So what is Santa Fe worth? 

If the railroad is valued on a private market basis -- at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of CNW -- it would have a value of $1.65 billion.
A compromise between bulls and bears puts remaining assets and cash -- including its 44% stake in its publicly traded pipeline -- at $2 billion.
Santa Fe also has $3.7 billion in debt.
In addition, its railroad lost a $750 million antitrust suit, which is on appeal, and which analysts say could be settled for one-third that amount. 

That nets out to about $17 a share for the company on a private market basis.
But Santa Fe, currently trading at 18 7/8, isn't likely to realize private market values by selling assets, because the tax against it would be onerous.
Its plan, instead, is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets. 

Robert D. Krebs, Santa Fe's chairman, argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways, "the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole." 

But it isn't clear why that should be so.
The spinoff argument, after all, reverses the current notion that assets are worth more to private buyers than to public shareholders.
And real estate usually hasn't traded well under public ownership. 

Salomon Brothers says, "We believe the real estate properties would trade at a discount . . . after the realty unit is spun off. . . . And what about the cost, and risk, of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values?" 

Some analysts remain bullish.
Mr. Schneider of Bear Stearns says he is recalculating the worth of the company's assets and, in the meantime, is sticking to his "buy" recommendation on the belief that he will find "values" of 30 a share.
He adds: "If for any reason I don't have the values, then I won't recommend it." 

First Boston's Graeme Anne Lidgerwood values Santa Fe at 24, down from her earlier estimate of 29.
Her recent report classifies the stock as a "hold." But it appears to be the sort of hold one makes while heading for the door. 

Quoting from the report: "The stock's narrow discount to asset valuation makes it a relatively unappealing investment at current prices, especially given the risk that our projections could be on the aggressive side." 

Chairman Krebs says the California pension fund is getting a bargain price that wouldn't have been offered to others.
In other words: The real estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests.
Since most of the unit's real estate is in California, the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards.
And, as Mr. Zell says, with Itel and O&Y on the unit's board, the real estate will be run by "a very unusual group" to say the least. 

It is possible then that Santa Fe's real estate -- even in a state imperiled by earthquakes -- could, one day, fetch a king's ransom.
But as Drexel analyst Linda Dunn notes, its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years.
So despite Wall Street's rosy talk of quickly "maximizing values," holders could be in for a long wait. 

Santa Fe Pacific 

(NYSE; Symbol: SFX) 

Business: Railroad, natural resources and real estate 

Year ended Dec. 31, 1988: 

Revenue: $3.14 billion 

Net loss: $46.5 million; 30 cents a share

Orkem S.A., a French state-controlled chemical manufacturer, is making a friendly bid of 470 pence ($7.43) a share for the 59.2% of U.K. specialty chemical group Coates Brothers PLC which it doesn't already own, the two sides said. 

The offer, which values the whole of Coates at #301 million, has already been accepted by Coates executives and other shareholders owning 12.4% of the company.
The acceptances give Orkem a controlling 53.2% stake in the company. 

Orkem and Coates said last Wednesday that the two were considering a merger, through Orkem's British subsidiary, Orkem Coatings U.K. Ltd. 

Orkem, France's third-largest chemical group, said it would fund the acquisition through internal resources.
The takeover would be followed by a restructuring of Orkem's U.K. unit, including the addition of related Orkem businesses and possibly further acquisitions.
Orkem said it eventually would seek to make a public share offering in its U.K. business. 

Stock prices surged as a multibillion-dollar takeover proposal helped restore market players' confidence about the prospects for further deal-making. 

Paper and forest-products stocks were especially strong, as the offer for Great Northern Nekoosa by Georgia-Pacific triggered speculation that the industry could be in for a wave of merger activity. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 41.60 to 2645.08 even though some late selling caused the market to retreat from session highs.
Trading was moderate, with 176,100,000 shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Aside from the takeover news, big buy orders were placed for blue-chip shares in afternoon trading.
Traders said the buy programs came from very large institutional accounts that were also active in the stock-index futures markets.
At one point, almost all of the shares in the 20-stock Major Market Index, which mimics the industrial average, were sharply higher. 

Some 1,111 Big Board issues advanced in price and only 448 declined, while broader market averages rose sharply.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 5.29 to 340.36, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 4.70 to 318.79 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index climbed 2.65 to 

Great Northern surged 20 1/8 to 62 7/8, well above Georgia-Pacific's offering price of $58 a share, amid speculation that other suitors for the company would surface or that the bid would be raised.
Nearly 6.3 million shares, or about 11.5% of the company's shares outstanding, changed hands in Big Board composite trading. 

With stocks having been battered lately because of the collapse of takeover offers for UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, analysts viewed the proposal as a psychological lift for the market. 

The $3.18 billion bid, which had been rumored since last week, "creates a better feeling that there's value in the market at current levels and renews prospects for a hot tape," says A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research Corp. 

Traders and analysts alike said the market's surge also reflected an easing of concerns about volatility because of moves by a number of brokerage firms to curtail or cease stock-index arbitrage.
Much of the instability in stock prices lately has been blamed on arbitrage trading, designed to profit from differences in prices between stocks and index futures. 

"People are looking for an ability to try and read the market, rather than be manipulated," said Dudley A. Eppel, manager of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
He noted that institutional investors showed "pretty general" interest in stocks in the latest session. 

But traders also said arbitrage-related trading contributed to the market's surge, as buy programs boosted prices shortly after the opening and sporadically through the remainder of the session. 

Georgia-Pacific fell 2 1/2 to 50 7/8, but most paper and forest-products stocks firmed as market players speculated about other potential industry takeover targets. 

Within the paper sector, Mead climbed 2 3/8 to 38 3/4 on 1.3 million shares, Union Camp rose 2 3/4 to 37 3/4, Federal Paper Board added 1 3/4 to 23 7/8, Bowater gained 1 1/2 to 27 1/2, Stone Container rose 1 to 26 1/8 and Temple-Inland jumped 3 3/4 to 62 1/4. 

Forest-products issues showing strength included Champion International, which went up 1 3/8 to 31 7/8; Weyerhaeuser, up 3/4 to 27 1/4; Louisiana-Pacific, up 1 1/8 to 40 3/8, and Boise Cascade, up 5/8 to 42. 

The theme of industry consolidation had surfaced earlier this year among drug stocks, which posted solid gains in the latest session.
Pfizer gained 1 7/8 to 67 5/8, Schering-Plough added 2 1/4 to 75 3/4, Eli Lilly rose 1 3/8 to 62 1/8 and Upjohn firmed 3/4 to 38.

The Treasury plans to raise $2.3 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $16 billion in short-term bills to redeem $13.71 billion in maturing bills. 

However, the Treasury said it will postpone the auction unless it has assurances of enactment of legislation to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auction date. 

The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Feb. 8, 1990, and May 10, 1990, respectively. 

Tenders for the bills, available in minimum $10,000 denominations, must be received by 1 p.m. EST Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.

LTV Steel Co. is boosting the prices of flat rolled steel products by an average of 3% following a recent erosion in the prices of such crucial steel products. 

The big questions are whether the increase, effective Jan. 1, 1990, will stick, and whether other major steelmakers will follow suit.
It is widely expected that they will.
The increase is on the base price, which is already being discounted by virtually all steel producers. 

But LTV's move marks the first effort by a major steelmaker to counter the free fall in spot prices.
Major steel producers are selling cold rolled sheet steel at about $370 a ton, compared with a peak price of $520 a ton in 1988.
Second-tier companies are receiving even less per ton.
LTV's planned increase, which was announced in an Oct. 26 memo to district managers, doesn't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate. 

LTV confirmed the price-increase plan, saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities.
A spokesman for LTV Steel, which is a unit of Dallas-based LTV Corp., noted that steel prices, adjusted for inflation, increased only 1.7% between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988, while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much.
At the same time, steelmakers are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive. 

But analysts say the company is also trying to prevent further price drops.
Moreover, they note that LTV may be trying to send a signal to major customers, such as Chrysler Corp. and Whirlpool Corp., that steelmakers need more money.
Both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with LTV and others. 

"They {LTV} may believe this can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time to get tough on prices," said Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. Mr. Marcus believes spot steel prices will continue to fall through early 1990 and then reverse themselves.
He isn't convinced, though, that the price decline reflects falling demand because the world economy remains relatively strong.
And while customers such as steel service centers are continuing to reduce inventories through the fourth quarter, they eventually will begin stocking up again, he notes. 

It won't be clear for months whether the price increase will stick.
Steelmakers announced a round of base-price increases last year, but began offering sizable discounts over the summer.
In fact, LTV was the first steelmaker to publicly boost discounts for buyers of cold rolled sheet steel and hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel. 

In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, LTV common shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $1.50. 

J.C. Penney Co. is extending its involvement in a televised home-shopping service by five to 10 years. 

Shop Television Network Inc., of Los Angeles, said Penney agreed to continue its exclusive arrangement with Shop Television, which does the production, marketing and cable distribution for the J.C. Penney Television Shopping Channel.
The channel reaches 6.5 million homes, a Penney spokesman said. 

Michael Rosen, president of Shop Television, said Penney decided to extend its involvement with the service for at least five years.
If, by that time, the network reaches 14 million homes, the contract will be renewed for five more years. 

Earlier this year, Penney abandoned another home shopping venture, Telaction Corp., after investing $106 million in it.
The company took a $20 million charge in the fiscal first quarter ended April 29, related to discontinuing the service. 

Bonnie J. Stedt was named an executive vice president of the American Express Travel Related Services Co. unit of this travel and financial services firm.
She retains her duties of human-resources director. 

British Petroleum PLC said its North Sea Ravenspurn South natural gas field has entered production. 

The company said Ravenspurn "A," the first of three unmanned wellhead platforms, started production.
The two others will be brought into production over the next year, BP added. 

Initial production from the field will be 70 million cubic feet per day, rising to 200 million cubic feet per day by 1991.
BP said the field had reserves of 635 billion cubic feet and an estimated production life of 20 years.
The field is 100% licensed to BP. 

Senate leaders traded proposals aimed at speeding action on legislation to narrow the deficit and raise the federal government's debt limit -- but the major stumbling block remains President Bush's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate. 

Democrats want the tax provision to be a separate bill, subject to the usual procedural obstacles.
Republicans, meanwhile, want to try to protect the measure by combining it with two politically popular issues that Democrats could find hard to block. 

The talks between Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and his GOP counterpart, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, are expected to resume today. 

Last night, after meeting with Mr. Bush and administration officials at the White House, Mr. Dole proposed streamlining the fiscal 1990 deficit-reduction bill, now stalled in a House-Senate conference committee, and passing a long-term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments. 

Under this plan, two provisions currently in the House version of the deficit-cutting bill -- repeal of both the catastrophic-illness insurance program and a controversial 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans -- would be made into a separate bill. 

Republicans would try to attach a capital-gains provision to that legislation, hoping the political popularity of its other two parts would dissuade Democrats from blocking it. 

Democrats want to avoid having to make that choice by making the capital-gains tax cut an individual bill.
Sen. Mitchell is confident he has sufficient votes to block such a measure with procedural actions. 

Both plans would drop child-care provisions from the House version of the deficit-reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill.
While that could make it vulnerable to a veto by Mr. Bush, Democrats argue that a presidential rejection would give their party a valuable issue in next year's congressional elections. 

Senate Democrats are to meet today to consider the GOP proposal. 

Yesterday, Mr. Dole seemed weary of the Bush administration's strategy of pushing the capital-gains measure at every chance in the face of Democratic procedural hurdles.
Pushing the issue on legislation needed to avoid default by the federal government, he told reporters, "doesn't seem to be very good strategy to me." 

At 12:01 a.m. EST today, the federal government's temporary $2.87 trillion debt limit expired.
To avoid default, lawmakers must pass legislation raising the limit to $3.12 trillion from $2.80 trillion by next Wednesday, according to the Treasury. 

Pressed by Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee, Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber told a congressional hearing that the administration would give up its demand for the capital-gains tax cut if faced with a potential default. 

Barbara Hackman Franklin, president of Franklin Associates, was elected a director of this building products maker.
Ms. Franklin, 49 years old, fills the position vacated by Naomi G. Albanese, who retired earlier this year at age 72. 

Paramount Communications Inc., New York, completed the sale of its Associates Corp. consumer and commercial finance subsidiary to a unit of Ford Motor Co. for $3.35 billion. 

Paramount, which agreed to sell the unit in July, said it would realize net proceeds from the sale of $2.6 billion, with an after-tax gain of $1.2 billion.
Paramount said the gain would be recorded in its fourth quarter, which ended yesterday. 

Paramount said the sale "completes the strategic restructuring" it began in 1983, and would enable it to focus on its entertainment and publishing businesses. 

Ford said in July it planned to operate Associates, based in Dallas, as a separate entity in its Ford Financial Services Group.
Paramount said Associates has about $14 billion in total assets, making it third-largest in terms of assets among independent finance companies in the U.S. 

Cilcorp Inc., Peoria, Ill., said it agreed to acquire the environmental consulting and analytical service businesses of Hunter Environmental Services Inc. of Southport, Conn. 

The utility holding company said Hunter will receive 390,000 shares of a new series of Cilcorp convertible preferred stock with a face value of $39 million for the businesses.
Cilcorp will also assume $22 million of Hunter's existing debt.
As part of the agreement, Cilcorp said it will pay Hunter $4 million in exchange for agreements not to compete. 

Cilcorp said the businesses to be acquired had revenue of $76 million for the year ended March 31. 

Separately, Cilcorp said it plans to purchase as many as 1.4 million shares, or 10% of its common stock outstanding from time to time on the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. 

The company, which currently has 13.5 million common shares outstanding, said it has no specific plans for the shares. 

It was a parent's ultimate nightmare.
As the crippled jet prepared for an emergency landing, Sylvia Tsao wrapped her 23-month-old son, Evan, in blankets and, following cabin-crew orders, placed him on the floor.
She held him down tightly, trying to protect him. 

"Suddenly, the world seemed to end," she told investigators later.
Crashing into a cornfield, United Airlines' Flight 232 flipped over, and she lost her grip on her son. "I saw for an instant my son's body floating and flying" toward the back of the plane, Ms. Tsao recalled.
When the plane stopped moving, she frantically tried to find him.
But Evan died of smoke inhalation. 

July's Sioux City crash has fueled an emotionally charged debate.
Safety advocates and members of Congress, calling babies "the neglected population," are stepping up a campaign for the mandatory use of infant safety seats on all flights.
But the Federal Aviation Administration is reluctant to require separate seats for babies because of the added cost for traveling parents. 

Some FAA officials note that few infants have been killed in plane crashes, raising the question of whether safety seats really are needed.
A 1981 Harvard Medical School study that scrutinized accidents in the late 1970s concluded that perhaps three babies would have been saved in a five-year period if safety-seat use had been required. 

The National Transportation Safety Board will take a close look at the issue during four days of hearings that begin today on the broader issue of what caused the crash that killed 112 people. 

"Infants', toddlers' and young children's safety should no longer be ignored as if they don't count," Mrs. Tsao wrote to the board in advocating use of the safety seats. 

All 50 states require that small children be strapped into safety seats in cars.
On planes, FAA rules dictate that children two years old and over have their own tickets and be strapped into regular seats, just as adults are.
Babies under two may sit on laps and fly for free.
But it is almost impossible to keep hold of a baby during an air crash, or even in severe turbulence. 

During the Sioux City crash, Lori Michaelson of Cincinnati lost her grip on her baby as the plane lurched and tipped over.
Another passenger heard one-year-old Sabrina's cry and pulled her from an overhead luggage compartment. 

The FAA encourages the use of safety seats, but in the past many parents have run into problems trying to use them, even when the plane was only half-full or they had bought an extra ticket especially for the baby. 

When Vanessa Merton, an associate dean at Pace University School of Law, decided to take her young son to Europe last spring, she called four carriers to ask about their policies on car seats. "The people acted like I was transporting heroin," she says.
One reservation agent told her -- incorrectly -- that the airline barred the use of the seats on flights. 

After the Sioux City crash, Lori Michaelson bought a car seat for her daughter for the flight home to Cincinnati.
But on one leg of the trip, she was ordered by a flight attendant to take Sabrina out of the seat and hold her during takeoff and landing -- the most dangerous parts of any flight. 

Airlines say that such mistakes are decreasing in the aftermath of Sioux City, but proponents of the safety devices say they still get complaints from parents. 

"People are told one thing on the phone, another at check in, another at the gate, and another on the plane," says Stephanie Tombrello, executive director of the Los Angeles Area Child Passenger Safety Association, which petitioned the FAA in June for mandatory use of child-safety seats.
The Association of Flight Attendants, the main flight attendants' union, is strongly backing that request. 

The FAA argues that requiring safety seats for all babies might actually diminish, not enhance, safety.
As part of such a rule, officials say, parents would probably be required to buy an extra ticket for the baby.
The increased cost of flying would inevitably encourage some families to drive rather than fly, they say.
Commercial airlines have the lowest accident rate of all transportation modes -- much lower than cars, for example. 

Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, contends that the current rule is the best approach because it allows parents to make their own decision on whether to use a safety seat.
But he admits that the agency is in "a very uncomfortable position." He says the agency soon will propose that airlines be prohibited from denying the use of safety seats. (Most airlines don't prohibit their use.) He says the agency also will seek public comment on whether the seats should be required. 

Walter Coleman, vice president of operations for the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the major airlines, describes the call for safety seats as "legitimate" and says the group is studying the issue. 

But privately some airline officials fear that if parents must buy extra tickets for babies, whole families will stop flying.
Others worry that the FAA might write a rule forcing airlines to pick up part of the tab for increased infant safety. 

Generally, airlines say they welcome the use of a government-approved safety seat and will even allow the restraint to take up a regular seat for free if the flight isn't crowded. (Most car seats made in recent years are certified for use on aircraft and are so marked.) But space can only be guaranteed if a ticket is purchased. 

What the industry really wants is some kind of device that would protect babies without taking up an extra seat.
But no one has come up with anything that is safer in a crash than the current practice of bundling babies up and trying to pin them to the floor.
Parents are advised against holding the infants, for fear that in an accident the babies could be crushed by the adult's weight. 

Proponents of safety seats are turning up the heat on the FAA. Yesterday, Rep. James Lightfoot, an Iowa Republican, sent FAA Administrator James Busey a letter signed by 56 House members urging the agency to require infant safety seats.
If the FAA refuses, Rep. Lightfoot says, he will push legislation to require the change. 

The city's Department of Consumer Affairs charged Newmark & Lewis Inc. with failing to deliver on its promise of lowering prices. 

In a civil suit commenced in state Supreme Court in New York, the agency alleged that the consumer-electronics and appliance discount-retailing chain engaged in deceptive advertising by claiming to have "lowered every price on every item" as part of an advertising campaign that began June 1. 

The agency said it monitored Newmark & Lewis's advertised prices before and after the ad campaign, and found that the prices of at least 50 different items either increased or stayed the same. 

In late May, Newmark & Lewis announced a plan to cut prices 5% to 20% and eliminate what it called a "standard discount-retailing practice" of negotiating individual deals with customers. 

The consumer agency also disputed Newmark & Lewis's continuing strategy of advertising "new lower prices" when allgedly there haven't been price reductions since June 1. 

Richard D. Lewis, president of the 47-store chain, defended the company's pricing campaign, saying it didn't use "the misleading expression `reduced from original prices. '" Mr. Lewis said the company marked price tags and advertised at its "lowest possible prices" for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion. 

Mr. Lewis said the company gave the Consumer Affairs department "volumes of documents" to substantiate its statements, and made "every effort to comply" with all the agency's policies. 

In its suit, the consumer agency seeks fines of $1,000 per violation of the city's Consumer Protection Law, costs of investigation, and an injunction to prevent Newmark & Lewis from continuing its allegedly deceptive advertising. 

Avery Inc. said it completed the sale of Uniroyal Chemical Holding Co. to a group led by management of Uniroyal Chemical Co., the unit's main business.
It valued the transaction at $800 million. 

Avery, which continues to operate a coal company it expects to sell at a loss, said in proxy materials it intends to seek control of one or more companies.
After fees and repayment of debt, Avery is left with about $24 million in cash and securities from the Uniroyal sale.
Avery paid $750 million, including various legal and financing fees, to acquire Uniroyal Chemical, Middlebury, Conn., in 1986 -- a move that burdened Avery with debt. 

In over-the-counter trading, Avery shares were quoted yesterday at a bid price of 93.75 cents a share. 

According to Avery, for the year ended Sept. 30, 1988, Uniroyal Chemical had sales of $734.2 million and a net loss of $47.1 million.
An Avery spokesman said that the loss was magnified by accounting adjustments and that the company's loss was smaller on a cash basis.
Uniroyal has 2,600 employees and facilities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Italy and Taiwan. 

In a related development, Avery said it completed a recapitalization in which its controlling shareholders and top officers, Nelson Peltz and Peter W. May, surrendered warrants and preferred stock in exchange for a larger stake in Avery's common shares.
On a fully diluted basis, the two raised their stake to 68% from 51%. 

In December 1988, Messrs.
Peltz and May sold their stock in Triangle Industries Inc., a packaging company they controlled, to Pechiney Corp. of France.
The executives had profited handsomely by building American National Can Co., Triangle's chief asset. 

In January 1989, the two men acquired the non-packaging assets of Triangle, including a controlling stake in Avery and, by extension, Uniroyal Chemical.
In the August proxy material, Avery said that unless it sold Uniroyal, its ability to service debt would be hurt and Avery's shareholder value would "continue to erode." Until Avery makes an acquisition, Messrs.
Peltz and May will waive their direct salaries and bonuses, the company said.
For at least the next six months, however, Avery will continue to pay $200,000 a month for management services to a company controlled by Messrs.
Peltz and May, according to the proxy material. 

Trial and Terror 

At times I sequester my mind 

When I must think with precision, 

Detached from all other thoughts 

While trying to reach a decision. 

But often nothing's resolved, 

To my frustration and fury: 

With pros and cons in limbo, 

I feel like a hung jury.

Analyses of why currencies do what they do, losing or gaining value against goods or each other, are a favorite pursuit of economists.
They also are often opaque to non-economists.
Eyes glaze over when monetarists talk about base money, velocity or purchasing power parity. 

Anyone wondering about the subject's importance, however, should ask Nigel Lawson, who resigned last week as Margaret Thatcher's Chancellor of the Exchequer amid political turmoil generated by Britain's drift toward stagflation.
Britain's inflation probably is traceable in part to Mr. Lawson's failure to get the pound-deutsche mark exchange rate right. 

Money's importance is central to a genteel debate now under way between two U.S. monetarist camps over something called the "world dollar base" (WDB).
One economic model fashioned out of this concept is predicting a U.S. recession late this year or early next year.
Whether the prediction is correct -- and with only two months left in 1989 time soon will tell -- the debate at least is a useful reminder that the U.S. dollar is not just a national, but an international currency.
If U.S. monetary policy goes astray it will have repercussions well beyond those that unseated the estimable Mr. Lawson. 

The WDB model in question is a product of an upstart economics shop called Bell Mueller Cannon Inc. (BMC).
When Goldman Sachs challenged the BMC recession forecast in its economic newsletter a few weeks ago, the BMC folks were delighted.
Even though critical, it was just the kind of attention they were seeking.
So they fired back at the Goldman Sachs objections in their own economics letter, "The BMC Report." They also arranged a luncheon in New York to further explain their forecast and solicit new clients. 

The BMC folks aren't really amateurs at intellectual dueling.
President Jeffrey Bell in 1978 upset longtime New Jersey Republican Senator Clifford Case in a primary and made an unsuccessful run at Bill Bradley's U.S. Senate seat.
John Mueller, BMC's vice president and chief economist, spent 10 years on the staff of Rep. Jack Kemp, sharpening his political skills and providing analysis to back up the congressman's supply-side arguments.
So even though BMC is only 18 months old, its principals have been part of the national economic debate for years. 

What is the world dollar base?
An article on these pages by Mr. Mueller on June 29 touched off the debate with Goldman Sachs.
It defined the WDB as not only currency and commercial bank reserves created by the Federal Reserve, but also the sum of dollar reserves held by foreign central banks. "The world dollar base, in fact, is analogous to the world stock of monetary gold under the classical gold standard," wrote Mr. Mueller.
BMC says it was able to predict the rise in inflation in the U.S. early this year from observing rapid growth in the world dollar base.
Its recession, or stagflation, forecast is based on the calculation that after growing at a 14% annual rate, the WDB has since come to a standstill. 

Goldman Sachs snapped back that the WDB is not an accurate predictive tool because dollar reserves in central banks do not dictate how much money there is in the world. "The Bundesbank might be rather surprised to be told that dollar purchases and sales were their only instrument for monetary policy!" observed Goldman Sachs. "Instead, the supply of money in foreign countries can be (and is) expanded and contracted through open-market operations just as is the case in the United States.
Foreign central banks buy or sell government securities to add or drain reserves from the banking system." BMC replied, yes, but in any monetary system there is one "final asset in which all forms of credit are ultimately payable" and today that final asset is the U.S. dollar. 

Whatever track record BMC is able to achieve, any debate is welcome that focuses on the U.S. dollar as the world's primary instrument for trade and investment among nations and the dominant foreign currency held by central banks.
Over the past 20 years or so, the dollar has followed an erratic course.
Its periods of weakness relative to other currencies correlate with rises in prices in the U.S. 

Mercantilists argue that a weak currency is a good thing because it makes a nation's products more competitive.
But that cherished notion may have influenced Mr. Lawson to peg the pound too low, causing Britain to import all of Europe's inflationary pressures.
A weak currency creates bargains for foreign buyers, sometimes pushing demand beyond a nation's productive capacity and forcing prices upward.
Criticisms of the U.S. Treasury for agreeing to participate in an international effort to drive down the dollar last month are based on that danger. 

The U.S., because of the dollar's world role, also has exported inflation at times.
When other central banks become concerned about a falling dollar and try to support it by buying dollars with their own currencies, it can inflate the supply of their own currencies. 

U.S. monetary policies ultimately will determine whether other nations are willing to accept American economic hegemony.
Their challenges to that hegemony are probably a good thing.
Because of America's international responsibilities, it is less free to engage in beggar-thy-neighbor tactics, through protectionism or attempts to manipulate currency relationships to its own advantage.
The U.S. Congress and administration need frequent reminders of that responsibility.
They also need reminders that if they shoulder the burden well, the U.S. can exercise enormous power on behalf of a sound world economy, with benefits to all. 

The best test of how well that responsibility is being exercised can be found simply in how much the dollar holds its value relative to goods and services.
But in a practical world, currency relationships can't be ignored either.
Whatever else the BMC model accomplishes, it furthers the discussion of how to achieve world monetary order.
Given the damaging effects of monetary disorders of the past, that is something much to be desired.
Just ask Nigel Lawson. 

When Thomas W. Wathen went big league last year, he acquired a treasure-trove of Americana along with a well-known but ailing security business: Pinkerton's Inc. 

There was a wanted poster offering "Rewards for the Arrest of Express and Train Robbers Frank James and Jesse W. James" and the original Pinkerton's logo with an open eye and the inscription "We Never Sleep," which inspired the phrase "private eye." Then there were two gold watches once owned by Allan Pinkerton, who founded the company in Chicago in 1850.
But there were supposed to be three, Mr. Wathen's company claims. 

The missing watch is emblematic of the problems Mr. Wathen encountered in building his closely held California Plant Protection Security Service into the largest detective and security agency in the U.S. through acquisitions.
The ever-optimistic Mr. Wathen has learned that while acquiring a big brand-name company can be a shortcut to growth, it can also bring a host of unforeseen problems. 

"We cleared out a lot of rats' nests," says the 60-year-old security veteran. 

Mr. Wathen, who started his career as an Air Force investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies, built his California Plant Protection from a tiny mom-and-pop security patrol firm here in the San Fernando Valley.
He joined the firm in 1963 and bought it from the owners the next year.
Over the next 20 years, California Plant Protection opened 125 offices around the country. 

Yet although California Plant Protection was netting bigger and bigger clients -- the firm provided security for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles -- it still didn't have the name recognition of Pinkerton's.
So when American Brands Inc. decided to sell the unit in 1987 as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations, Mr. Wathen saw a chance to accomplish several objectives. 

He decided he could easily merge Pinkerton's operations with his own while slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities.
He could acquire a staff of loyal Pinkerton's employees, many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm, he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition he'd wanted. 

Mr. Wathen also relished the chance to demonstrate an entrepreneur like himself, who'd spent his whole career in the security business, could run Pinkerton's better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker. "The security business is my favorite subject.
I love this business," he says. "Most of the LBO guys don't know how to run a business anyway." 

But there were hitches, not the least of which was that, Mr. Wathen says, he proceeded almost blindly in doing the $95 million acquisition, which was completed in January 1988. "We weren't allowed to do any due diligence because of competitive reasons.
If we had, it might have scared us off," he says. 

Five years of rapid expansion under American Brands, with an emphasis on marketing the agency's services instead of improving them, had hurt Pinkerton's profits, Mr. Wathen claims.
He says his team couldn't tell whether accounts receivable had been paid or not.
Pinkerton's had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business, with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired, he adds.
And regional offices were "egregiously overstaffed," he claims.
One office had 19 people doing the work of three, "and half of the employees had company automobiles." 

American Brands declined to comment on Mr. Wathen's accusations. 

The acquisition combined the country's second-largest security company, Pinkerton's, with 1987 sales of $410 million, and the fourth largest, California Plant Protection, with $250 million in sales, creating the industry's biggest firm, which took on the Pinkerton's name.
Even after divesting itself of $120 million of unprofitable business, the new Pinkerton's will have sales of about $610 million this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of 2%-3% of sales, says Lloyd Greif of Sutro & Co. in Los Angeles, which arranged the Pinkerton's acquisition. 

Mr. Wathen says his turnaround strategy has been simple: just hack away at the fat.
He began by closing 120 of the combined companies' 260 offices in two months, eliminating about 31% of the company's 2,500-person adminstrative staff, including more than 100 sales positions.
He shut down the company's tony New York headquarters.
Pinkerton's world headquarters today is a nondescript, two-story office building across the street from the small Van Nuys Airport. 

Next, Mr. Wathen raised Pinkerton's rates, which were 75-cents-an-hour lower than California Plant Protection's average rate of around $8.63.
And he got rid of low-margin businesses that just weren't making money for the company. 

Mr. Wathen, who says Pinkerton's had a loss of nearly $8 million in 1987 under American Brands, boasts that he's made Pinkerton's profitable again.
But Mr. Wathen's team still must pay down about $82 million of long-term bank debt from the acquisition within the next four years.
Last year, earnings of the combined companies didn't cover debt service and Pinkerton's was forced to borrow $20 million of subordinated debt. "We wouldn't have had to refinance if a lot of the problems hadn't been there," Mr. Wathen says.
This year, Mr. Wathen says the firm will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit. 

Now Pinkerton's could become entangled in a protracted legal fracas with its former parent.
The company recently filed suit in state court in Los Angeles against American Brands, seeking at least $40 million in damages from the Old Greenwich, Conn.-based company. 

The suit alleges that American Brands misrepresented the financial condition of Pinkerton's before the sale, failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which Pinkerton's was in default, hadn't registered the Pinkerton's name and trademark in the United Kingdom and didn't tell California Plant Protection about some labor controversies. 

"We have previously had discussions with representatives of Pinkerton's Inc. concerning the {sale of the company} and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract," says American Brands. "As this is now a litigation matter, we have no further comment." 

And then there's the case of the missing gold watch. 

The lawsuit alleges that an inventory of Pinkerton's memorabilia disclosed that one of the watches hadn't been forked over by American Brands. "American Brand's failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new Pinkerton's in an amount as yet {to be} determined and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained," the suit charges. 

The key to Pinkerton's future will be sticking to what it does best -- being a security company, says Mr. Wathen.
The company is also renewing its emphasis on investigations, particularly undercover investigations for corporations.
Although investigations now account for only about 5% of Pinkerton's total revenue, that side of the business has traditionally been the more "glamorous" of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value. (Author Dashiell Hammett, who wrote "The Maltese Falcon," was a former Pinkerton's detective.) 

American Brands "just had a different approach," Mr. Wathen says. "Their approach didn't work; mine is." 

It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world's environmental problems ("Is Science, or Private Gain, Driving Ozone Policy?" by George Melloan, Business World, Oct. 24).
To suggest that a 10% drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted.
Consider the fact that a mere 2% drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure.
Even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny-wise and pound-foolish. 

The reason environmentalists "don't mind seeing new crises arise" is because there are new crises.
Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago.
If you are doubtful, consider for a moment that the Pomton Lakes Reservoirs in northern New Jersey, which supply the tristate area with drinking water, are riddled with toxic PCBs.
This is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group's ploy to create a market. 

It's time business leaders and the general public learn that mankind does not rule over this natural environment but is rather the integral, symbiotic player within nature's workings.

Mr. Melloan's column was right on the money, but I wish it could have gone one step further.
As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer, I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland-Molina theory (named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth's atmosphere) and the Montreal Protocol.
An important part of my effort has been to understand the science so I can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design. 

In my research, I have found a paper by Joseph Scotto of the National Cancer Institute and several colleagues reporting an 11-year decrease in UV-B radiation at eight U.S. measurement sites. 

Our concern for the ozone layer, of course, grows out of the potential for increasing UV-B radiation, which could damage flora and fauna.
The last of the measurements reported was in 1985, but recent conversations with Mr. Scotto indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend.
I understand, but haven't yet verified, that there are studies by Norwegians, Russians and the Max Planck Institute that show either unchanging or declining UV-B at the surface. 

To me, this calls into question the validity of the Rowland-Molina theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort.
This, in turn, threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written.
My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, Friends of the Earth, etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited.
When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study, I was urged to get back to the agenda topic, which was, ironically, a schedule for getting rid of HCFCs, the so-called soft CFCs that are such an important part of the CFC substitution scenario. 

Subsequently, I have learned that a private group, of which Du Pont is a part, is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the Scotto report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated UVB measuring instruments.
But this is almost an underground activity.
To my knowledge, no government entities, including the EPA, are pursuing UV-B measurements.
The topic never comes up in ozonedepletion "establishment" meetings, of which I have attended many. 

It seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by CFCs.
While recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened, I intend to urge that UV-B be monitored whenever I can.

The relationship between surface release of CFCs and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in 1974.
Although, like all scientific theories, it had its initial opponents, few experts question the connection now.
The discovery of the ozone "hole" over Antarctica and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to CFC concentrations. 

In the September issue of Scientific American, Thomas E. Graedel, distinguished member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories, and Paul J. Crutzen, director of the air chemistry division of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, West Germany, wrote, "It is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons, particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12 are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion." Mr. Melloan quotes Peter Teagan and invokes the name of Arthur D. Little Inc. to support his statement.
However, unlike Messrs.
Graedel and Crutzen, who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry, Mr. Teagan has no special expertise in the area.
He is a mechanical engineer, not an atmospheric chemist. 

It is insulting and demeaning to say that scientists "needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts" and that environmental groups need them to stay in business.
Solving the global environmental problems we all face will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry, policy makers and the scientific community world-wide.

Global Environmental Change Report 

Arlington, Mass. 

A shiny new takeover deal sparked a big rally in stock prices, which buoyed the dollar.
Bond prices also edged higher. 

Georgia-Pacific's $3.18 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa helped drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 41.60 points, to 2645.08, in active trading.
The dollar drew strength from the stock market's climb.
Long-term bond prices rose despite trepidation about what a key economic report will show today. 

Analysts said the offer for Great Northern Nekoosa broke the pall that settled over the takeover business for the past three weeks in the wake of the collapsed UAL Corp. buy-out.
Great Northern Nekoosa soared $20.125 a share, to $62.875, substantially above the $58 a share Georgia-Pacific is offering.
That indicates speculators are betting a higher offer is in the wings.
Prices of other paper makers rose sharply, although Georgia-Pacific fell $2.50 a share, to $50.875. 

Despite all the furor over program trading, program trading played a big role in yesterday's rally.
Some traders point out that as the big brokerage firms back out of program trading for their own accounts or for clients, opportunities increase for others to engage in the controversial practice.
That's what happened yesterday. 

The rally notwithstanding, there are plenty of worries about the short-term course of stock prices.
A slowing economy and its effect on corporate earnings is the foremost concern of many traders and analysts.
Unless the Federal Reserve eases interest rates soon to stimulate the economy, profits could remain disappointing. 

Yesterday's major economic news -- a 0.2% rise in the September index of leading economic indicators -- had little impact on financial markets.
But the next important piece of news on the economy's health -- this morning's release of the national purchasing manager's survey for October -- could prompt investors into action. 

A report late yesterday that the Chicago-area purchasing managers survey showed increased economic activity in that part of the country cut into bond-price gains.
If the national survey confirms a pickup in the manufacturing sector, it could further depress bond prices while bolstering stock prices and the dollar. 

Meanwhile, bond investors are laboring under the onus of a national debt ceiling debate.
Although the Treasury is expected to announce details of its November quarterly refunding operation today, the Nov. 79 schedule could be delayed unless Congress and the president act soon to lift the nation's debt ceiling. 

In major market activity: 

Stock prices rallied in active trading.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 176.1 million shares.
Advancing issues on the Big Board surged ahead of decliners 1,111 to 

Bond prices rose.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained less than a quarter of a point, or less than $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount.
The yield on the issue slipped to 7.91%. 

The dollar gained against most foreign currencies.
In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8415 marks and 142.85 yen compared with 1.8340 marks and 141.90 yen late Monday. 

Sanwa Shutter Corp. said its affiliated company in Malaysia, established this April, will begin manufacturing steel doors Wednesday. 

Its partner in the joint venture is Sin Kean Boon Metal Industries, Penang, Malaysia. 

Company officials said the new company, Sin Kean Boon-Sanwa (J.V.) is capitalized at the equivalent of 54 million yen ($381,000).
The Japanese concern has a 40% stake, while the local partner has a 60% stake. 

The new company was created to meet growing demand for steel doors, concurrent with increasing local concern about fire prevention, the company said. 

Unocal Corp., Los Angeles, said it and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. would create a petroleum marketing and refining general partnership in the Midwest. 

The joint venture, Uno-Ven Co., would generate total annual revenue of about $500 million and have 1,100 employees, a Unocal spokesman said.
Unocal said the venture would enable it to recover more of its refining and marketing investment and prepare for expected growth in exploration, production, chemicals and other areas. 

It said financing would consist of $250 million from a private placement obtained through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and a $150 million revolving credit line underwritten by Chase Manhattan Bank. 

In addition to Unocal's 153,000 barrel-a-day refinery near Lemont, Ill., the new venture would control 17 distribution terminals, a lubricating-oil blending and packaging plant, and 131 company-owned Unocal service stations.
It said the venture, expected to take control of the facilities Dec. 1, would also serve another 3,300 independent Unocal gasoline stations.
Petroleos will supply 135,000 barrels of oil a day for the refinery, Unocal said. 

Japan's steel exports fell 12.2% in September from a year earlier and were down 1.1% from the previous month, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation reported. 

September was the 10th consecutive month in which steel exports failed to reach the year-earlier level. 

A federation official attributed the decline to brisk demand from domestic industries backed by continuing economic expansion in Japan. 

Japanese steel companies are apparently focusing on domestic sales, but the official said it doesn't necessarily mean that local sales contracts are increasing that markedly. 

"They are just too busy to meet domestic demand and have little room for overseas shipments," the official said. 

As the leading candidate for president of his country in next year's election, Mario Vargas Llosa ought to be in an enviable position.
But his country is Peru, where political visibility, especially for a believer in democracy and free enterprise -- a right winger in Latin American eyes -- makes a man a target for assassination.
For almost any Peruvian these days, to show an interest in public office is a heroic gesture; for Mr. Vargas Llosa especially so, since he already has achieved a high position in the world's eyes as a writer.
Published everywhere to universal acclaim, doted on like a movie star in the Hispanic world from Barcelona to Ushuaia, Mr. Vargas Llosa could live comfortably on his royalties and console his political conscience with the thought that Peru is a hopeless mess not of his making and that he already did his best to reform it with his magnificently cinematic novel about the years of military dictatorship of his youth, "Conversation in the Cathedral." 

But, after some hesitation, he is back on the stump and also still writing important novels about Peru. "The Storyteller" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 246 pages, $17.95), splendidly translated by Helen Lane, first appeared in Spanish in 1987 before the Peruvian economy had reached its present state of virtual collapse.
And in any case the story takes place a bit earlier than that, when the guerrilla war in the highlands had not yet made internal travel a gamble with destiny.
Even still, the very first sentence of this fable that weaves together Peru's most advanced and most primitive cultural strands speaks of "my unfortunate country." The narrator may be talking about the depredations of the Shining Path Maoists among the Indians of the Andes, or he may be referring to the plunging inti, Peru's rubber currency, or the corrupting effect of the cocaine trade.
But he is swiftly drawn into a tangle of memories about a less newsworthy and more exotic part of Peru: its corner of the Amazon jungle. 

This narrator is a foil for Mr. Vargas Llosa, a cosmopolitan writer with one well-tailored leg in journalism.
He is in Florence to shake himself free of Peru and get some writing done, just as Mr. Vargas Llosa has gone to Paris and now goes frequently to London for the same purpose.
But this narrator happens upon some photographs in a gallery, pictures taken in Peruvian Amazonia of the untamed and nomadic Machiguenga tribe.
And they remind him of his own experiences with that unhappy scattered culture and of his friend at Lima's University of San Marcos, Saul Zuratas.
Saul was a high-strung student of ethnography, a Jew marked doubly as an outsider because of a huge wine-dark birthmark on his face, for which people called him Mascarita, Mask Face.
Saul knew about the Machiguengas from his studies, and through him the narrator became interested in this most recalcitrant and un-Westernizable of all the indigenous peoples who had come under the Spanish yoke.
Saul, meanwhile, came to believe that anthropology, even at its most benign, was as insidious a form of cultural imperialism as the superficially more blatant activities of Christian missionaries.
Saul mysteriously disappears. 

This is what we know at the end of the opening section of "The Storyteller." The next voice we hear sounds like this: "There was no evil, there was no wind, there was no rain.
The women bore pure children.
If Tasurinchi wanted to eat, he dipped his hand into the river and brought out a shad flicking its tail . . ." And this: "Moving, walking.
Keeping on, with or without rain, by land or by water, climbing up the mountain slopes or climbing down the ravines." The speaker is never identified.
He tells his stories in his majestically simple way, in a "language" all his own.
There are creation myths and cosmologies and hunting stories -- a whole culture is contained within these dreamy narratives.
It is as though Mr. Vargas Llosa had recorded a storytelling session at a Machiguenga campfire.
And this is just the effect he hopes to have on the reader, as he alternates chapters in his "own" voice with chapters somehow "borrowed" from the Machiguenga storyteller. 

For most of the book, there is no direct connection between its urban and its Amazonian modes.
But the contrast between them becomes a living thing through the brilliant contrast of narrative styles that Mr. Vargas Llosa creates.
He controls this counterpoint like a novelistic Bach, reaching an audacious extreme in a hilarious chapter in which the "Vargas Llosa" voice relates his adventures as an inept television newsman.
But the joke turns serious when a reportage takes him to Amazonia and he encounters the missionaries who know more than anyone else about the Machiguengas.
By this point, the narrator has become obsessed with finding out about the Machiguenga storytellers, who, he had heard years before, functioned like cultural glue for a tribe split into many small bands in constant motion through the jungle.
The storytellers traveled among the bands, reminding them of their identity.
But why would no Machiguenga the narrator meets during his reportage even admit that there were storytellers? 

The narrator eventually deduces the extraordinary answer, which is confirmed in a literally Kafkaesque manner by a storyteller in the next chapter.
I am trying to give away as little as possible, but this is not really a mystery or some kind of jungle thriller.
It will be read for the brilliant clash of styles of narration and the even more brilliant way that they have been tied together into a large metaphor for literature and its function in society. 

A baby boom in sub-Saharan Africa, the world's poorest region, poses a threat for the area's future. 

The region's population, currently estimated at some 500 million people, is growing by 3.2% a year -- "faster than any major region has ever experienced over a sustained period," the World Bank noted in a recent review of the region between the great desert and South Africa.
This is more than six times the rate for industrial nations. 

"Rapid population growth impedes sub-Saharan Africa's progress toward virtually all its major goals," including higher living standards, the bank said.
Noting that traditional African culture respects a woman with many offspring, it said substantial resources, including foreign aid, are needed to effect change. 

Otherwise, the bank said, "By the time a child born today is 22, if present trends continue, sub-Saharan Africa's population will have doubled.
When that child is 40, it will have quadrupled." 

West Germany's Lufthansa has agreed to buy a 10% stake in Austrian Airlines when the Austrian government continues next spring to sell parts of the carrier to the public, an Austrian Airlines spokesman said.
Swissair will at the same time raise its stake in Austrian Airlines to 10% from the current 8% holding, he added.
Elsewhere, Singapore Airlines Ltd., following its recently announced tie-up with Delta Air Lines Inc., is now "contemplating an alliance" with one of several European carriers, Chairman J.Y. Pillay said. 

King Fahd of Saudi Arabia dismissed as untrue allegations that his country's relations with Kuwait were marred by the Saudis' execution last month of 16 Kuwaiti Shiites; the Shiites had been convicted for bombings at Mecca.
The king stressed to the Kuwaiti Al-Seyassah newspaper that the terrorists were given a fair trial in accordance with Islamic law. "Those people have been convicted after committing an awful crime," the king said.
The Kuwaiti government hasn't issued any comment on the executions. 

Israel is ending six weeks of seizing property from Palestinians who refuse to pay income and value-added taxes in the occupied West Bank town of Beit Sahour, despite having failed to break the revolt, security sources said.
Troops and tax collectors have confiscated cars, furniture and goods valued at about $1.5 million from residents of the mainly Christian middle-class town, sparking international protests.
The army gave no explanation for calling off the seizures, less than a month after Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin vowed to break the tax rebels. 

The Asian Development Bank denied media speculation that it's about to resume lending to China.
The bank cut off loans to the country in the wake of the June 4 massacre in Beijing.
The ADB staff is continuing to "prepare loan proposals for China" to present to the bank's board, said R.D. Pacheco, the bank's chief information officer.
Other ADB officials said the board wasn't ready to consider resuming loans to China because leading ADB members, including the U.S. and Japan, remain opposed to a return to normal business with Beijing. 

As Japan formally announced it's joining an international ban on trading ivory, hundreds of angry ivory traders and carvers marched in downtown Hong Kong to protest the ban.
Some of the marchers presented a petition to the U.S. consulate demanding that Washington, which earlier banned the import of ivory, help the endangered industry.
Hong Kong traders have until Jan. 19 to sell off their stockpile of 670 tons of ivory. 

Environmental groups urged Japan to stop importing timber from Malaysia's Sarawak state, where they say loggers are destroying rain forests and trampling on the rights of natives. 

Japan imports about 50% of the logs exported from the state, which is on the island of Borneo.
The call came as the council of the International Tropical Timber Organization opened a nine-day session in the Japanese city of Yokohama.
Dr. Mikhail Kavanagh, an official of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said that "anything that the Japanese can do to influence the trade is going to come straight back in to influence how the forests are managed." He urged Japan to reduce "wasteful use of tropical timbers," such as disposable chopsticks. 

One study group says Japan's consumption of disposable chopsticks has doubled in the past decade, reaching 20.5 billion pairs in 1988. 

Pravda said that Nikolai Vasilenko, a Soviet farmer, dug up a gold bar valued at $235,000, but consumer-goods shortages left him little to spend it on during a trip to Vladivostok.
He wanted to buy, but couldn't find, a shaving brush, a sewing machine and a colander . . . China is facing a musical talent shortage because top artists are leaving for foreign countries, the China Youth News said.
The official daily said that 470 musicians went abroad at their own expense in the past decade, and it implied that few are likely to return. 

Stelco Inc. said it plans to shut down three Toronto-area plants, moving their fastener operations to a leased facility in Brantford, Ontario. 

The company said the fastener business "has been under severe cost pressures for some time." The fasteners, nuts and bolts, are sold to the North American auto market. 

A company spokesman declined to estimate the impact of the closures on earnings.
He said the new facility will employ 500 of the existing 600 employees.
The steelmaker employs about 16,000 people. 

Stelco said it has an option to lease a 350,000-square-foot building in Brantford and proposes to spend 24.5 million Canadian dollars (US$20.9 million) on the facility.
The three existing plants and their land will be sold. 

Gillette Co., Boston, said it is planning to restructure its South African subsidiary.
Under the plan, Gillette South Africa will sell manufacturing facilities in Springs, South Africa, and its business in toiletries and plastic bags to Twins Pharmaceuticals Ltd., an affiliate of Anglo American Corp., a South African company. 

Terms were not disclosed.
A final agreement has not been signed, and the moves will not have a material effect on the company, Gillette said.
The company said it is part of a continuing world-wide restructuring in which it has downsized or sold operations in several countries.
Gillette said its continued presence in South Africa "enables it to make meaningful contributions to South African society, to the lives of its employees and to the communities in which it operates." Gillette South Africa employs about 250 people.
About 60% of the work force will continue with Gillette or transfer to Twins Pharmaceuticals, the company said. 

Technology stocks woke up, helping the over-the-counter market rise from its recent doldrums. 

The Nasdaq Composite Index surged 4.26, or about 0.94%, to 455.63.
It was the market's biggest gain since rising more than 7 points on Oct. 19.
Advancing OTC stocks outpaced decliners by 1,120 to 806. 

But the move lagged a stronger rise in New York Stock Exchange issues.
The Big Board's composite index was up more than 1.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.6%. 

Nasdaq's gain was led by its biggest industrial stocks.
The Nasdaq 100 rose 7.08 to 445.23.
The Financial Index of 100 biggest banks and insurance issues added 2.19 to 447.76.
Other strong sectors were indicated in gains of the Transportation Index, up 7.55 to 475.35, and the Utility Index, up 8.68 to 730.37. 

National Market System volume improved to 94,425,000 shares from 71.7 million Monday. 

Many of Nasdaq's biggest technology stocks were in the forefront of the rally.
Microsoft added 2 1/8 to 81 3/4 and Oracle Systems rose 1 1/2 to 23 1/4.
Intel was up 1 3/8 to 33 3/4. 

But traders who watch the stocks warned the rise may be yet another "one-day phenomenon." 

Technology stocks bore the brunt of the OTC market's recent sell-off, and traders say it's natural that they rebound sharply now that the market has turned around.
But, they caution, conservative investors would do well to sell into the strength. 

"They are always the first to be sold when people are taking profits, because people are most scared of the high-technology stocks," said Robin West, director of research for Ladenburg Thalmann's Lanyi division, which specializes in emerging growth stocks. 

The technology group includes many of the OTC market's biggest stocks, which dominate the market-weighted Nasdaq Composite Index.
Analysts say rallies in the group historically have lifted the market, while weakness in the sector often sank unlisted share prices broadly. 

But increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted investors who try to follow its dips and swings.
The stocks have been pummeled repeatedly by inventory gluts and disappointing earnings as the industry matures and slows.
Some even claim the group has become a lagging, not leading, indicator. 

The technology sector of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index has risen only about 6.24% this year, while the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 18.35%.
While the composite index lost less than a third of its year-to-date gains in the market's recent decline, the technology group's gains were more than halved. 

The OTC technology sector is far from a cohesive unit.
The group is divided primarily between software, semiconductors and computers.
While computer stocks have taken the biggest hit from the slowdown in the industry, many software and semiconductor stocks have continued to outperform the market.
Microsoft is up more than 50% this year, while Intel is up more than 40%. 

The technology group is also split between large companies and small, with the biggest stocks trading as blue-chip issues in the institutional marketplace, while the smaller stocks churn on their individual merits or faults, analysts say.
The volatility of smaller technology companies has served the group well overall in recent stock trading, according to Hambrecht & Quist's technology stock indexes. 

The brokerage firm tracks technology stocks with its Technology Index, which appreciated only 10.59% in the first nine months of this year.
But the firm also tracks smaller technology companies as a subset of the larger group.
That index, which contains technology companies with annual revenues of $200 million or less, gained 17.97% by Sept. 30 this year -- still lagging the S&P 500, but leading larger technology firms. 

Yesterday, bank stocks lagged behind the overall OTC market.
The Nasdaq Bank Index rose 0.17 to 432.78.
George Jennison, who trades bank stocks for Shearson Lehman Hutton, said the stocks tend to fall behind because they aren't traded as much as many other issues.
But, he added, interest-rate-sensitive stocks in general are stalled. 

"The interest-rate sensitives aren't rallying with the rest of the market because of fears about what the (Federal Reserve) will do," Mr. Jennison said.
He said that investors will scour the October employment report, due out Friday, for clues about the direction of the economy and the immediate outlook for interest rates. 

On the other hand, Mr. Jennison noted that the recent slide in bank and thrift stocks was at least halted yesterday. 

Shearson Lehman Hutton gave small investors some welcome news by announcing that it would no longer handle index-arbitrage-related program trades for its accounts.
Shearson, with its in-house order execution system, has handled the bulk of such program trades in the over-the-counter market.
The trading has been blamed for much of the market's recent volatility.
Jaguar topped the most-active list, as its American depository receipts climbed 1 3/4 to 13 5/8 with more than 6.6 million ADRs traded.
Britain said it would waive its "golden share" in the luxury auto maker if shareholders vote to allow a suitor to acquire more than 15% of the company.
The announcement effectively removes the British government as an impediment to a takeover of the company, which is being stalked by General Motors and Ford. 

Gen-Probe was another active takeover stock.
It surged 2 3/4 to 6 on volume of more than 1.7 million shares after the company agreed to be acquired by Japan's Chugai Pharmaceutical for about $110 million -- almost double the market price of Gen-Probe's stock. 

Priam Corp. lost 5/32 to 3/32 after filing for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 

MCI Communications added 1 1/2 to 43 3/8.
The company has toted up over $40 million in contracts in the past two days.
Monday, MCI announced a $27 million multiyear contract with the investment bank Stuart-James.
Yesterday, it received a $15 million, three-year contract from Drexel Burnham Lambert. 

Florida National Banks of Fla. slid 1 1/8 to 24 3/4.
Late Monday, the Federal Reserve Board said it is delaying approval of First Union Corp. 's proposed $849 million acquisition of Florida National Banks pending the outcome of an examination into First Union's lending practices in low-income heighborhoods.
Florida National said yesterday that it remains committed to the merger. 

Dycom Industries gained 3/4 to 16 3/4 after it said it agreed to buy Ansco & Associates and two affiliates for cash and stock.
The value of the transaction wasn't disclosed.
The companies being acquired provide telecommunications services to the telephone industry. 

Willamette Industries, whose stock has suffered steep losses in recent sessions, surged 1 1/2 to 49.
The stock was one of many in the paper products industry that rose following Georgia-Pacific's $3.18 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa. 

Richard J. Riordan was elected a director of this single-family home builder, increasing the board to nine.
He is a senior partner with the law firm of Riordan & McKinzie and is a partner in Riordan Venture Management. 

Wary investors have been running for the stock market's equivalent of bomb shelters, buying shares of gold-mining and utility companies. 

Those two groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs.
On Friday, when only a dozen common stocks hit 52-week highs on the New York Stock Exchange, five were gold-mining issues, and another four were utilities.
On Monday, when a mere seven common stocks managed new highs, six were utilities or golds. 

At first glance, gold and utilities seem strange bedfellows.
After all, gold prices usually soar when inflation is high.
Utility stocks, on the other hand, thrive on disinflation, because the fat dividends utilities pay look more attractive when prices are falling (or rising slowly). 

But the two groups have something very important in common: They are both havens for scared money, stocks for people who hate stocks.
It's as if investors, the past few days, are betting that something is going to go wrong -- even if they don't know what. 

If the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they're on firmer footing, these stocks might well fall back.
Indeed, that happened to some extent yesterday, as industrial stocks rebounded, partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry. 

Still, a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares. "The primary overriding thing is that people are frightened," says Martin Sass, a New York money manager. "The aftershocks of Oct. 13 (when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points) are still reverberating." 

Certainly, the Oct. 13 sell-off didn't settle any stomachs.
Beyond that, money managers and analysts see other problems.
Inventories are creeping up; car inventories are already high, and big auto makers are idling plants.
Takeover fever has cooled, removing a major horse from the market's cart. 

Britain's unsettled political scene also worries some investors. "The gyrations in the British government" add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market, says John Hoffman, assistant director of research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "One of the three major markets in the world is getting chewed up pretty bad." 

"If the Fed does not come to the rescue and produce lower short-term interest rates over the next 30 days, the market's going to flounder," says Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. 

With this sort of sentiment common, it's natural for investors to seek out "defensive" investments.
Utilities are a classic example: Even in recessions, people continue to use electric power, water and gas at a fairly steady rate. 

Such defensive issues as food, tobacco, and drug stocks have been in favor for some time.
But many of these stocks have now become expensive.
Mr. Wachtel points to Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. as examples: They're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per-share earnings. 

Gold stocks aren't cheap on this basis, either, with many selling for 20 times earnings or more.
Even utility stocks aren't all that inexpensive, at an average of 14 times earnings.
But the two groups represent a further step in defensiveness.
If gold stocks and utilities continue to lead, it may signal that the market is in for rough times. 

That's just what Joseph Granville expects. "We are going to explode lower," says the flamboyant market seer, who had a huge following a few years back. "Anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible.
You don't want to own anything long except gold stocks." 

One reason for his gloom is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows.
Last Friday, 96 stocks on the Big Board hit new 12-month lows.
But by Mr. Granville's count, 493 issues were within one point of such lows. 

Robert Stovall, a veteran New York money manager and president of Stovall/ Twenty-First Securities, has money in both gold and utility issues. "I think we could very well have {an economic} slowdown, beginning very soon if not already," he says. 

Mr. Stovall doesn't expect an actual recession.
But he does expect "a muffler dragger" of an economy, with "very slow growth, maybe one quarter of no growth at all." In such a climate, utility stocks look good to him.
He favors FPL Group Inc., Florida Progress Corp., TECO Energy Inc., Wisconsin Energy Corp., and Dominion Resources Inc. 

The appeal of gold issues, Mr. Stovall says, is that "they're a counter group.
You go into them because they move counter to the general market." He adds that gold stocks had been down so long they were "ready for a bounce." His favorites are American Barrick Resources Corp., Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp. 

Nevertheless, Mr. Stovall emphasizes that "you don't buy {gold stocks} based on powerful fundamentals." In addition to having high price-earnings ratios, most pay puny dividends, if any. "The earning power {of gold mining companies} is restricted unless the gold price hops up over $425 an ounce," he says. 

Abby Cohen, an investment strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold. "My outlook is for a decline of about 10% in corporate profits" in 1990, she says.
But "a bunch of utilities" should post profit increases.
Among utilities, Drexel currently favors Entergy Corp. and General Public Utilities Corp. 

As for gold, she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak, as it has been lately.
Among gold stocks, Drexel likes Battle Mountain Gold Co., Newmont Gold Co. and Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co. 

QVC Network Inc. said it completed its acquisition of CVN Cos. for about $423 million. 

QVC agreed to pay $19 and one-eighth QVC share for each of CVN's 20 million fully diluted shares. 

The acquisition brings together the two largest competitors to Home Shopping Network Inc., which now reaches more viewers than any other company in the video shopping industry.
Among them, Home Shopping, QVC and CVN already control most of that young and fast-growing market, which last year had sales of about $1.4 billion. 

Director Steve Kloves took a big gamble on Michelle Pfeiffer's voice.
He'd cast the actress, not exactly known for her way with a song, as the singing star of "The Fabulous Baker Boys" -- and he wanted her to carry the tunes herself.
So the call went out for Sally Stevens. 

Ms. Stevens is what is known in the trade as a studio singer.
The Los Angeles-based artist estimates that she's performed on 200-300 film scores, among them "The Abyss," "Ironweed" and "Klute." Her voice is audible on the incidental music for the TV series "The Wonder Years," "Miami Vice" and "Matlock." She has also worked frequently as a lyricist and as a vocal contractor, hiring and conducting choruses to sing movie title tracks. 

"Most of what I do is very anonymous.
But I was not brave enough to say I was willing to starve to death to be a recording artist.
And doing studio work has been a wonderful way to make a living for a long, long time," said Ms. Stevens, who for five years in a row received the Most Valuable Player award as a female studio vocalist from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization that hands out the Grammys. 

Ms. Stevens's involvement with "Baker Boys" was the result of a long affiliation with the movie's composer, Dave Grusin. "I had written lyrics with him and had sung for him in various films and contracted voices for him," she said. "He knew my work and he called.
It was really funny.
When you approach a singer and tell her you don't want her to sing you always run the risk of offending.
He said, `I don't know if this is going to be a compliment or an insult but . . .' Then he explained that Michelle was going to do this film and the role she was playing was that of a singer and they wanted very much for her to do her own singing if that was possible." At that point nobody, including Ms. Pfeiffer herself, was certain it would be possible. 

She had, after all, sung in only one movie, "Grease II," and the vocal demands of "Baker Boys" -- singing standards with only a piano backup -- were considerably more imposing -- and exposing -- than belting out a rock 'n' roll score in concert with several other singers and instruments. 

If Ms. Pfeiffer wasn't sure she was up to putting over numbers like "The Look of Love," "Ten Cents a Dance" and "My Funny Valentine," Ms. Stevens wasn't sure she was up to showing the way. "I had not done any coaching before," she said. "I have produced vocal performances in the studio for professional singers.
But I had never taken anyone from scratch before.
I had to go a lot by instinct.
I think Dave thought that in my career I had done what the Susie Diamond character had done and that Michelle, consciously or unconsciously, would pick up some things." 

One of the first lessons took place at the Cinegrill, a lounge in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel where Ms. Stevens brought Ms. Pfeiffer to hear a nightclub singer and soak up some atmosphere. "Her instincts were wonderfully astute," remembered Ms. Stevens, who is in her 40s. "Michelle sensed an undercurrent of anger in the singer's performance.
I think it's true with a lot of club singers who haven't had the recognition they feel they deserve or that they had hoped for." Accordingly, Ms. Pfeiffer incorporated anger into the development of her character. 

As for Ms. Pfeiffer's vocal development: For five or six weeks, Ms. Stevens made daily two-hour visits to the actress's Santa Monica home armed with sheet music, and on occasion albums by June Christy, Blossom Dearie and Ella Fitzgerald, artists Ms. Pfeiffer hadn't paid much mind to in the past. "I suggested Michelle listen to Ella," said Ms. Stevens. "Nobody sings better, not that I wanted her to sound like Ella but there's a quality artists of that period had that we felt the character Susie might have listened to." 

From the way she sang in those early sessions, it seemed clear that Michelle had been listening not to Ella but to Bob Dylan. "There was a pronunciation and approach that seemed Dylan-influenced," recalled Ms. Stevens.
Vowels were swallowed, word endings were given short or no shrift. "When we worked it almost became a joke with us that I was constantly reminding her to say the consonants as well as the vowels." To explain exactly what she meant, Ms. Stevens and Mr. Grusin went into a Los Angeles studio and recorded a vocal/piano demo of the songs being considered for inclusion in the movie so that Ms. Pfeiffer could learn the numbers, correct enunciation and all.
Mr. Grusin also made a demo tape with just piano to provide accompaniment when Ms. Pfeiffer practiced. 

What Ms. Pfeiffer had going for her besides determination -- Ms. Stevens recalled that the actress was up one night until 3 a.m. practicing "My Funny Valentine" -- was an airy alto, a nice breathy quality and intelligence. "When we first started working it was a matter of finding a language we both understood," Ms. Stevens said. "I couldn't talk with her as I would with someone who had a lot of vocal training." 

So what Ms. Stevens talked about was the importance of saying the words at the front of the mouth with the lips and the teeth.
She urged Ms. Pfeiffer to get the feeling of a smile in her throat and to put a smile on her face to give the pitch and the sound a lift.
She kept harping on the importance of overdoing the consonants and percussive endings like "T" and "K." She talked about using language as a tool, about flirting with the lyrics.
And please, Michelle, when you sing the line in "Makin' Whoopee," about another sunny, funny honeymoon, don't say "funn-ih," the way Dylan would.
Say "funn-eeee." Put the clean vowel ending on it.
And Michelle, must you continue to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day? 

"It was a process of discovery," said Ms. Stevens, who admitted she sometimes felt a bit like Henry Higgins. "What I tried to do was take the sparks of the positive stuff and fan them.
I tried not to do much `don't do this, don't do that. '" 

There was another layer to the coaching: Helping Ms. Pfeiffer sing a song the way Susie Diamond would sing it.
Not brilliantly, because, after all, this was a performer who was collecting paychecks from lounges at Hiltons and Holiday Inns, but creditably and with the air of someone for whom "Ten Cents a Dance" was more than a bit autobiographical. "It was an exercise of blending Michelle's singing with Susie's singing," explained Ms. Stevens. "If `Dangerous Liaisons' had been a musical she would have had to give a different vocal performance because she was a different character in that movie." 

Ms. Pfeiffer's vocal performance in "Baker Boys" -- recorded for posterity on the soundtrack album (GRP) -- is such that after her first number, "More Than You Know," viewers begin murmuring to each other "Is that really her singing?
That isn't really her." "I can swear that every single note in that movie was hers," averred Ms. Stevens, who had begun kidding her protege that she was going to get a `Tonight Show' booking. "Seeing Michelle up there," she added, "was like watching myself or my daughter.
I was so nervous.
I wanted her to be so good.
I didn't want to feel as if I'd let her down." 

Ms. Kaufman is a free-lance writer based in New York. 

Joe F. Lynch, the 56-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of First Continental Real Estate Investment Trust, was named to the new post of vice chairman of this bank holding company. 

The head trader of Chemical Banking Corp. 's interest-rate options group has left the company, following valuation errors that resulted in a $33 million charge against its third-quarter results. 

Chemical said Steven Edelson resigned recently, but one individual close to the situation said the resignation was forced.
Mr. Edelson couldn't be reached for comment. 

A separate inquiry by Chemical cleared Mr. Edelson of allegations that he had been lavishly entertained by a New York money broker.
That inquiry hasn't resolved similar allegations involving another Chemical options trader. 

In other personnel changes stemming from problems in its options unit: 

-- Chemical named James Kennedy, a trader in swaps contracts for the bank, to assume Mr. Edelson's duties and to be trading manager for derivative products, including swaps and interest-rate options. 

-- Lee Wakeman, vice president in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management to straighten out the mess, resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at Continental Bank in Chicago.
Mr. Wakeman, whom Chemical tried to keep, didn't return calls for comment. 

Separately, Chemical confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge in the second quarter for losses on forward-rate agreements involving foreign currency written by its branch in Frankfurt, West Germany. 

A Chemical spokeswoman said the second-quarter charge was "not material" and that no personnel changes were made as a result.
The spokeswoman said the Frankfurt situation was "totally different" from problems in the interest-rate options unit. 

According to individuals familiar with the situation, the Frankfurt loss stemmed from a computer program for calculating prices on forward-rate agreements that failed to envision an interest-rate environment where short-term rates were equal to or higher than long-term rates. 

While the incidents involving interest-rate options and forward-rate agreements are unrelated, some observers say they echo a 1987 incident in which Bankers Trust New York Corp. restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by about $80 million. 

These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions.
In an interest-rate options contract, a client pays a fee to a bank for custom-tailored protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period.
In a forward-rate agreement, a client agrees to an exchange rate on a future currency transaction. 

Some competitors maintain the interestrate option loss, in particular, may have resulted more from Chemical's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem. 

Started three years ago, Chemical's interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field.
From 1987 to 1988, the value of Chemical's option contracts outstanding mushroomed to $37 billion from $17 billion.
More importantly, the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost 2-to-1.
With such a lopsided book of options, traders say, Chemical was more vulnerable to erroneous valuation assumptions. 

The Chemical spokeswoman said the bank has examined its methodologies and internal controls. "We consider our internal controls to have worked well," she said, adding that some procedures have been strengthened.
Its valuation methodologies, she said, "are recognized as some of the best on the Street.
Not a lot was needed to be done." 

Coast Savings Financial Inc. reported a third-quarter loss, citing a previously announced capital restructuring program. 

The Los Angeles thrift holding company said it had a loss of $92.2 million, or $6.98 a share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30.
Coast earned $10.2 million, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
The year-ago results have been restated to comply with government regulations. 

The restructuring program is designed to increase the company's tangible capital ratio.
It includes removing $242 million in good will from the books, issuing $150 million in preferred stock and commencing an exchange offer for $52 million in convertible bonds. 

During the third quarter, the company charged about $46 million against earnings in reducing goodwill, added $20 million to its general loan loss reserves and established a $30 million reserve for its high-yield bond portfolio.
The company said its junk-bond portfolio after these moves had been reduced to less than 1% of assets. 

Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co. will sell its contract-drilling business, and took a $50.9 million loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter because of the planned sale. 

The New Orleans oil and gas exploration and diving operations company added that it doesn't expect any further adverse financial impact from the restructuring. 

In the third quarter, the company, which is 61%-owned by Murphy Oil Corp. of Arkansas, had a net loss of $46.9 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with a restated loss of $9 million, or 18 cents a share, a year ago.
The latest period had profit from continuing operations of $4 million.
Revenue gained 13% to $77.3 million from $68.5 million. 

Ocean Drilling said it will offer 15% to 20% of the contract-drilling business through an initial public offering in the near future.
It has long been rumored that Ocean Drilling would sell the unit to concentrate on its core oil and gas business. 

Ocean Drilling said it won't hold any shares of the new company after the restructuring. 

Coda Energy Inc. said it arranged a $50 million credit facility with NCNB Texas National Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp., of Charlotte, N.C. 

The Dallas oil and gas concern said that $10 million of the facility would be used to consolidate the company's $8.1 million of existing bank debt, to repurchase 4 million of its 4.9 million shares outstanding of Series D convertible preferred stock, and to purchase a 10% net-profits interest in certain oil and gas properties from one of its existing lenders, National Canada Corp.
The remaining $40 million can be used over three years for oil and gas acquisitions, the company said. 

Ted Eubank, Coda's president, said the loan carries an interest rate of prime plus one percentage point, with 85% of the company's net oil and gas revenue each month dedicated to repayment.
The company put up "virtually all" of its oil and gas properties as collateral, he said. 

Deere & Co. said it reached a tentative agreement with the machinists' union at its Horicon, Wis., plant, ending a month-old strike by workers at the facility. 

The maker of farm equipment said the three-year labor agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at John Deere Horicon Works, Deere's primary facility for producing lawn and grounds-care equipment, takes effect immediately and extends through Oct. 1, 1992.
About 1,150 employees are covered by the new agreement, Deere said. 

The Soviet legislature approved a 1990 budget yesterday that halves its huge deficit with cuts in defense spending and capital outlays while striving to improve supplies to frustrated consumers.
The vote to approve was 

A proposal to raise prices of beer, tobacco and luxuries was rejected 338-44. 

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the legislators they had made a good start, but that the most difficult work was still ahead. 

The Tass news agency said the 1990 budget anticipates income of 429.9 billion rubles (US$693.4 billion) and expenditures of 489.9 billion rubles (US$790.2 billion). 

Those figures are almost exactly what the government proposed to legislators in September.
If the government can stick with them, it will be able to halve this year's 120 billion ruble (US$193 billion) deficit. 

Officials proposed a cut in the defense budget this year to 70.9 billion rubles (US$114.3 billion) from 77.3 billion rubles (US$125 billion) as well as large cuts in outlays for new factories and equipment. 

Tass said the final budget and economic plan calls for a sharp increase in the production of consumer goods. 

Intelogic Trace Inc. said it is exploring alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including the possible sale of the company. 

But Asher B. Edelman, who controls about 16% of the San Antonio, Texas, computer-servicing company, insisted that the announcement didn't have anything to do with the ongoing battle for control of Datapoint Corp. 

Any sale of Intelogic could have an impact on the battle between Mr. Edelman and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint.
Intelogic holds 27.5% of Datapoint's common shares outstanding. 

Mr. Edelman said the decision "has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman." Mr. Ackerman contended that it was a direct response to his efforts to gain control of Datapoint. 

Intelogic was spun off from Datapoint four years ago, shortly after Mr. Edelman took control of Datapoint. 

The portfolio unit of the French bank group Credit Lyonnais told stock market regulators that it bought 43,000 shares of Cie. de Navigation Mixte, apparently to help fend off an unwelcome takeover bid for the company. 

Earlier yesterday, the Societe de Bourses Francaises was told that a unit of Framatome S.A. also bought Navigation Mixte shares, this purchase covering more than 160,000 shares. 

Both companies are allies of Navigation Mixte in its fight against a hostile takeover bid launched last week by Cie.
Financiere de Paribas at 1,850 French francs ($297) a share.
Navigation Mixte's chairman had suggested that friendly institutions were likely to buy its stock as soon as trading opened Monday. 

The Credit Lyonnais purchase, for 33,000 regular common shares and 10,000 newly created shares, is valued at about slightly more than 80 million French francs. 

I would like to respond to Jude Wanniski's Oct. 19 editorial-page article, "Bradley's Team Gave the Market Its Drubbing," as a nonpartisan portfolio manager who is hardly amused by this overzealous emphasis on the Senate's maneuvering on capital gains as the prime reason for the market's slide on Oct. 13.
In fact, there are several reasons for an end to the bull market and for this particular 190-point slam-dunk. 

First, addressing the Oct. 13 market break, this was certainly more of a technical gyration and a local jungle exercise, than an investor reaction to the day's political events in Washington.
Look not to the managers of taxable investment funds as the source of selling late that afternoon, but rather to several of the usual suspects ("investment" banks and institutions) geared up with imperfect trading programs that accelerate market deterioration, once begun.
The catalyst for this decline was, indeed, the breakdown of the United Airlines transaction and its resultant pre-margin call liquidation of various holdings by arbitragers and other traders.
I can assure Mr. Wanniski that the market is not as politically motivated as he is. 

With regard to the bull market's sad demise, this can be attributed to several factors: 

1.
Overextension of credit.
The realization that interest rates will be firm due to excessive demand for credit on the part of the federal government (including off-balance sheet requirements) and leveraged buyout related transactions.
The latter credit demands no longer supported to the same degree by the market (suppliers, Michael Milken and the S&Ls, being noticeably absent). 

2.
Perception of future deterioration of corporate profits.
This was exemplified by IBM's recent announcements.
One can magnify this problem 10 times for highly leveraged companies whose revenues are slowing and where interest rates are no longer accommodative, in bifurcated credit markets. 3.
A dollar that will slide into year end -- due to international interest-rate differentials and the choreographed trading techniques of certain oil importers -- which does not inspire foreign-investor interest. 

4.
Inflation that will be stable for the time being, despite the rising cost of imported goods, because of rising domestic inventories (housing, divestiture candidates, commodities, etc.) requiring liquidation.
Modest inflation/deflation adding to the attractiveness of bonds. 

5.
The honeymoon is over for poor George.
In the past week this was highlighted by continuing fallout on Panama and abortion rights, as well as capital gains.
Anticipated poor results for Republicans at the polls in November have added to investor ennui. 

In sum, there are technical, economic, political and psychological reasons for the market's recent drubbing.
Mr. Wanniski can "cheerfully inform" Mr. Bradley and the rest of us of his notions as to the party's end, but his energy and intellect would be better used in focusing on measures that will ensure our long-term success as leaders and capitalists.

Mr. Wanniski might seem simplistic to some when he blames the Oct. 13 market crashlet on Democratic obstructionism of the president's capital-gains proposal.
But it's quite true Wall Street responds dramatically to changes in the capital-gains rate, especially growth stocks. 

The great Growth Bull Market began in June 1978 just when the late Rep. William Steiger's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax to 25% from almost 50% began to gather majority support in Congress.
The bull market in growth stocks halted when the rate was hiked to 28% from 20% effective January 1987.
The Dow and other averages continued to advance, but growth-stock multiples suffered sclerosis from that point until this summer, when the market began to realize the rate might indeed be lowered.
All the indexes surged when a lower rate passed the House.
The UAL financing reverse shocked the market, but the prospect of capital gains not fulfilling the market's hopes was also an important factor. 

Richard Gilder Jr. 

New York 

Mr. Wanniski's opportuning of the recent stock drubbing to castigate Sen. Bill Bradley for his opposition to a capital-gains tax cut contains some clever but faulty reasoning.
If Mr. Wanniski's theory is right, that a tax cut increases the value of capital assets held by owners, wouldn't that increase also represent a rather dramatic and totally unjustified inflation of those values?
According to his figures, asset values would be pumped up some $50 billion overnight with the passage of the cut.
This is "real money," Mr. Wanniski says.
I say, real trouble.

NEC Corp. said it plans to more than double its British subsidiary's capacity for the production of semiconductor wafers. 

Officials at the Japanese semiconductor maker said the company intends to increase investment in plant and equipment by 10 billion yen ($70.6 million), to 90 billion yen, in the year ending March 31, with the extra funds used to increase production overseas. 

Officials said they weren't sure how the money will be distributed among overseas units, but added that NEC Semiconductors U.K. Ltd. will receive priority. 

Officials also disclosed it's possible that NEC may reduce domestic production of one-megabit chips to five million a month from six million, beginning January, because of deteriorating market prices. 

Roger M. Marino, president, was named to the new post of vice chairman.
Michael Ruettgers, who had been executive vice president, operations, was named president and chief operating officer.
EMC manufactures data-storage systems for mainframes and minicomputers. 

Clarcor Inc. said a plan to sell its J.L. Clark Inc. subsidiary to a group headed by Anderson Industries Inc. for $70.3 million has been terminated. 

Clarcor, a maker of packaging and filtration products, said the two companies couldn't agree on terms of a definitive agreement.
The sale price of the unit, which makes packaging products, was to consist of cash, notes and an amount to be determined by the unit's future performance. 

Clarcor said it is inviting proposals from other prospective purchasers of the unit. 

Both Clarcor and Anderson are based in Rockford, Ill. 

Nearly two months after saying it had been the victim of widespread fraud, MiniScribe Corp. disclosed it had a negative net worth of $88 million as of July 2 and hinted that it might be forced to file for protection under bankruptcy laws. 

Richard Rifenburgh, chairman and chief executive of the Longmont, Colo., disk-drive maker, also said the company continued losing money in the third quarter and expects to sustain further losses through the end of the year. 

Mr. Rifenburgh told industry analysts he is moving "aggressively" to negotiate out-of-court settlements on a number of shareholder lawsuits, but noted that the company could file for bankruptcy-law protection if settlement talks fail.
Mr. Rifenburgh also noted that 150 million shares of MiniScribe common stock were traded during the past three years, "so there's a tremendous amount of exposure." 

MiniScribe has said that its financial results for the past three fiscal years would have to be restated because of the allegedly fraudulent accounting and marketing practices that inflated revenues and net income. 

MiniScribe also hasn't filed any financial statements for 1989.
Mr. Rifenburgh said such statements should be ready by the end of November.
He said he expects the company to have $500 million in sales for this year.
He didn't say what the company expected to report for year-earlier sales, which will be restated from the previously reported $603 million. 

The release of MiniScribe's new balance sheet came one day after it introduced its new line of one-inch disk drives, on which it is pinning much of its hope for survival.
Although it is not the first company to produce the thinner drives, which store information in personal computers, MiniScribe says it is the first with an 80-megabyte drive; the company plans to introduce a 120-megabyte drive next year. 

Analysts and consultants had mixed reactions to yesterday's announcements, praising Mr. Rifenburgh's efforts but questioning whether the company can survive in a highly competitive marketplace. "It's a wait-and-see attitude," said Dave Vellante, vice president of storage research for International Data Corp. Others pointed out that at least four other disk-drive makers will have competitive one-inch drives early next year and that the industry already operates on very thin margins. 

The company also faces delisting by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
The company continues to trade in the over-the-counter market with an exception to listing requirements.
MiniScribe filed a status report with the NASD on Monday, detailing its efforts to comply with listing requirements and requesting an extension of the exception, but hasn't received a response.
MiniScribe common closed yesterday at $1.9375, down 6.25 cents, and has been trading for several months at less than $3 a share. 

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Jerry Rafferty in Denver is reviewing the report prepared by MiniScribe's outside directors, to determine if criminal charges should be brought before a grand jury. 

The MiniScribe report outlines a host of allegedly fraudulent practices, including the shipment of bricks and defective disk drives that were booked as sales, and inventory forgeries in accounting records.
The internal investigation also criticized MiniScribe's auditors, Coopers & Lybrand, for allegedly ignoring numerous red flags. 

Mr. Rifenburgh said the board still hasn't acted on most of the internal report's recommendations, pending restatement of the balance sheet.
He added that he expects to make a recommendation within a few weeks on whether MiniScribe should file its own lawsuits against former company officers and directors. 

Fujitsu Ltd. said it wants to withdraw its controversial one-yen bid to design a waterworks computer system for the city of Hiroshima. 

Meanwhile, Japan's Fair Trade Commission said it was considering launching an investigation into whether the bid, the equivalent of less than a penny, violates anti-monopoly laws. 

Hiroshima last week held an auction to pick the contractor, expecting to pay about 11 million yen for the project.
Eight companies submitted bids, but Fujitsu won the contract by essentially saying it would do the job for free. 

News of the bid drew sharp criticism from other computer companies and industry observers.
Fujitsu itself, which said the bid hadn't been approved by its headquarters, was clearly embarrassed.
The bid wasn't "socially acceptable," a company spokeswoman said. 

Hiroshima officials said they still consider the contract in effect and had no immediate plans to cancel it.
They said they wanted to wait for the outcome of any government investigation before deciding what to do. 

The stock market stumbled after getting off to a strong start and closed mixed in lackluster trading. 

Bargain-hunting and futures-related program buying lifted prices at the outset, but the rise proved short-lived as concerns about this week's economic reports and the potential for further losses in stocks weighed on investors. 

Selected blue-chip issues attracted buying interest, however, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stayed in positive territory throughout the entire session.
The average, which peaked with a gain of more than 23 points, added 6.76 to 2603.48. 

Broader market averages were little changed.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index went up 0.01 to 335.07, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index dipped 0.01 to 314.09 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index eased 0.01 to 185.59. 

Activity was fairly brisk at the opening as hopes for a recovery from last week's string of five consecutive losses in the industrial average led some investors into the market.
Program buying related to stock-index arbitrage then surfaced shortly after 10 a.m. EST and carried prices to their session highs. 

But the pace slowed quickly following the round of arbitrage-related buying, involving the sale of index futures contracts and the purchase of stocks, and stayed sluggish through the rest of the session as prices drifted. "People are sitting on their hands," said Bill Langevin, manager of institutional trading at Morgan Keegan & Co., Memphis, Tenn. 

Just 126,630,000 shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 170.3 million Friday and 135.9 million last Monday.
Declining stocks led advancers on the Big Board, 774 to 684. 

Traders attributed the lackluster activity in part to anticipation of the first pieces of economic data for October: a monthly survey of corporate purchasing managers, due tomorrow, and the employment report, set for Friday. 

Also, a number of analysts believe stocks could fall to the vicinity of their lows during the market's mid-October sell-off before posting any sustainable gains.
The industrial average hit bottom near the 2500 level on both Oct. 13 and Oct. 16. 

The market has begun a process of "trying to find a floor" after its fall, said William M. LeFevre, a market strategist at Advest Inc., Hartford, Conn.
He added that the floor could prove to be well above the recent price lows, depending on whether the economic data ease concerns about slower growth.

Crossland Savings tumbled 1 1/2 to 3 3/4 in the wake of its management's recommendation to suspend dividends, because of concerns that it may not meet capital requirements under new federal regulations.
The proposed criteria would bar Crossland from including its $380 million of preferred stock as so-called "core capital."

A NEW MINIMUM-WAGE PLAN has been worked out by Congress and Bush, opening the way for the first increase in over nine years.
The compromise proposal, ending a long impasse between Democrats and the president, would boost the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by April 1991 from $3.35 now.
The legislation also includes a lower "training wage" for new workers who are teen-agers.

Courtaulds PLC announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value. 

The British chemical and textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create a new, listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between #300 million ($473 million) and #400 million, analysts said.
The establishment of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as early as next year's first quarter. 

Investors welcomed the move.
Courtaulds' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence, valuing the entire company at about #1.44 billion. 

Courtaulds' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders.
Courtaulds' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain, though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC's plans to spin off roughly #4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.
The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of #50 million on #980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31. 

Some analysts have said Courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined.
In addition, Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities. 

Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year.
Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake, Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy.
Even without a specific takeover threat, Courtaulds is giving shareholders "choice and value," said Julia Blake, an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 

In a statement, the company said: "Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies.
The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders, customers and employees." 

Courtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff. 

Spanish stock exchange regulators plan to hand Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. the maximum fine for irregularities by its former Madrid unit in connection with Spanish oil company Repsol S.A.'s stock issue in May, a senior government official said. 

Pedro Perez, secretary of state for economic affairs, said the National Stock Exchange Commission intends to propose the maximum penalty because of what he called the "decidedly fraudulent" nature of the operations under scrutiny. 

Under Spanish stock market rules, the commission can call for a fine equivalent to as much as five times the profits generated.
Based on what Drexel has said its office made on the transaction, the maximum fine would be 72.5 million pesatas ($621,624). 

But Carlos Croissier, chairman of the commission, yesterday said that figure is incorrect.
He declined to say if the actual fine will be higher or lower.
He said he hasn't submitted a formal proposal.
Under Spanish law, the fine must be proposed by the commission and approved by the Economy Ministry. 

Drexel closed its Spanish unit, DBL Capital Markets Espana S.A., in July after confirming that it had used the names of 400 individuals to buy Repsol shares, which it then resold to institutional clients, circumventing restrictions designed to make shares available to private investors. 

In New York, a spokesman for Drexel said, "There is nothing to comment on; nothing has been settled yet." 

The U.S. Export-Import Bank cleared a $25 million loan to a telephone company in Chile for the purchase of satellite telecommunications network equipment from U.S. suppliers. 

The Export-Import Bank said Cia. de Telefonos de Chile is buying equipment and project management services from Scientific-Atlanta Inc., of Norcross, Ga., to extend telephone and data-transmission services between Santiago and other Chilean cities.
The bank said several other U.S. companies also will supply electronic equipment for this project. 

The loan, which carries a 9.65% annual interest rate, was approved after Scientific-Atlanta won a $29.4 million contract to supply equipment and services for the project in Chile.
According to Export-Import Bank officials, Japanese and French companies also bid for the business.

Shaken by tumbling stock prices and pessimistic projections of U.S. economic growth, currency analysts around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar's near-term performance. 

Most of the 10 analysts polled last week by Dow Jones International News Service in Frankfurt, Tokyo, London and New York expect the U.S. dollar to ease only mildly in November.
Opinion is mixed over its three-month prospects.
Half of those polled see the currency trending lower over the next three months, while the others forecast a modest rebound after the New Year. 

In late afternoon New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8415 West German marks, up from 1.8340 marks late Monday, and at 142.85 yen, up from 141.90 yen late Monday.
A month ago, a similar survey predicted the dollar would be trading at 1.8690 marks and 139.75 yen by the end of October.
Sterling was trading at $1.5805, down from $1.5820 late Monday. 

In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency was trading at about 142.95 yen at midmorning, up from 142.80 yen at the opening and up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 142.15 yen. 

The average of estimates of the 10 economists polled puts the dollar around 1.8200 marks at the end of November and at 141.33 yen. 

By late January, the consensus calls for the dollar to be trading around 1.8200 marks and near 142 yen.
Those with a bullish view see the dollar trading up near 1.9000 marks and 145 yen, while the dollar bears see the U.S. currency trading around 1.7600 marks and 138 yen. 

A number of those polled predict the dollar will slip as the Federal Reserve eases interest rates. 

David Owen, an economist at Kleinwort Benson & Co. in London, said he expects further cuts in short-term U.S. rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the U.S. economy. 

Robert White, a vice president and manager of corporate trade at First Interstate of California, agreed with that view and predicted the U.S. federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3/4% and 8% within 60 days from its current level at 8 13/16%.
Fed funds is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans; the Fed influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system. 

Mr. White also predicted a half-point cut in the U.S. discount rate in the near future.
The discount rate, currently 7%, is the rate the Fed charges member banks for loans, using government securities as collateral. 

He expects such a cut "because of problems in several sectors of the economy, particularly real estate and automobiles." 

Bolstering his argument, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that new home sales for September were down 14% from August's revised 3.1% fall.
The drop marked the largest monthly tumble since a 19% slide in January 1982. 

In last month's survey, a number of currency analysts predicted the dollar would be pressured by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the U.S. and West Germany. 

Indeed, in early October the West German central bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point.
Several other European central banks, notably in Britain, followed the West German Bundesbank's lead by raising their own key rates.
And a week later, Japan raised its official discount rate by a half point to 3.75%.
The Japanese discount rate is the central bank's base rate on loans to commercial banks. 

After a surprisingly sharp widening in the U.S. August merchandise trade deficit -- $10.77 billion from a revised $8.24 billion in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13, the Federal Reserve relaxed short-term interest rates, knocking fed funds from around 9% to 8 3/4%. 

But predictions that central banks of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial nations would continue their massive dollar sales went astray, as the market drove the dollar downward on its own, reacting to Wall Street's plunge and subsequent price volatility, lower U.S. interest rates and signs of a slowing U.S. economy.
G-7 consists of the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, Canada, France and Italy. 

Tomoshige Kakita, senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term, thus damping dollar demand. 

But, Mr. Kakita added, once U.S. equities regain some stability, players will move back into dollar-denominated investments, especially Treasury bonds, whose value rises when interest rates decline. 

Mr. Kakita said the key dollar-yen exchange rate is at 135 yen. "If 135 is broken, some panic will be seen," he predicted, explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen. 

Jens-Uwe Fischer, a senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in Frankfurt, said he expects the dollar to recover within the next three months to around 1.88 marks as U.S. economic data, particularly U.S. trade figures, level off.
He contended that the Fed won't ease rates further, but predicted Bundesbank officials will relax key rates in West Germany. 

Alfred Zapfel, chief trader at Bank of Boston in Frankfurt, took an opposite stance.
He said he expects U.S. interest rates to decline, dragging the dollar down to around 1.80 marks by the end of January after a short-lived dash to 1.87 marks by the end of November.
West German interest rates, he said, will remain unchanged. 

"But I'm not one of these great dollar bears you see more of these days," Mr. Zapfel said. "I can't really see it dropping far below 1.80 marks." 

Scott Greene, chief foreign exchange dealer with Julius Baer & Co. in New York, fits the description of a "great dollar bear." He predicted the U.S. unit will skid below 1.80 marks to around 1.78 marks this month and 1.75 marks by the beginning of the new year. 

"We're finally seeing the culmination of all the recessionary buildup of the last few months," he said, noting a continuing downward trend in U.S. interest rates, a shaky stock market and "gloomier economic times ahead" all signal a significantly lower dollar. 

In the wake of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's surprise resignation and sterling's subsequent nose-dive, most analysts had little good to say about the pound's near-term prospects. 

Mr. Owen of Kleinwort Benson suggested that the new chancellor, John Major, will take a tough line in his autumn statement later this month, helping to underpin the pound.
But, he warned, the currency will remain at risk. 

On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery dropped $3.10 to $374.70 an ounce in moderate trading.

Toyota Motor Corp. predicted its annual imports will more than double by 1992, growing by 250% over the next three years to about 300 billion yen ($2.12 billion) as the company's overseas manufacturing operations reach full speed. 

The projected imports comprise importation to Japan and other nations of vehicles produced at the company's major foreign manufacturing bases. 

Toyota said its import program will specifically entail importing right-hand drive vehicles from its Georgetown, Ky., U.S. plant. "An ultimate target of 40,000 units annually has been set for a still-to-be-named model," Toyota said. 

Toyota will also begin importing engines produced at the Kentucky plant's new powertrain operation.
Annual volume is expected to reach 100,000 units and will result in additional production and new employment opportunities, Toyota said. 

It added that exports of U.S.-made Camrys to Taiwan will rise to 10,000 a year by 1992 from a 1989 level of 4,000 units. 

Toyota also announced a number of major overseas purchases.
They include plans to buy 200 vehicles from U.S. and European auto makers for Toyota's Rent-A-Lease division in Japan and plans to purchase a Cray Y-MP8-232 supercomputer. 

A permanent smoking ban on virtually all domestic airline routes won approval from the House, which separately sent to President Bush a nearly $67 billion fiscal 1990 bill including the first construction funds for the space station. 

The smoking prohibition remains attached to a $27.1 billion transportation bill that must still overcome budget obstacles in Congress.
But yesterday's action put to rest any lingering resistance from tobacco interests.
Faced with inevitable defeat, the once dominant industry declined any recorded vote on the ban, which covers all but a fraction of 1% of daily flights in the U.S. 

The sole exceptions are an estimated 30 flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in Hawaii and Alaska.
Assuming final enactment this month, the prohibition will take effect 96 days later, or in early February. 

On a 394-21 roll call, the House adopted the underlying transportation measure.
But the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated $3.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs.
The additional spending pushes the measure more than $2 billion above its prescribed budget ceiling, and the House Appropriations Committee leadership must now seek a waiver in hopes of completing action today. 

The separate $67 billion bill sent to the White House had budget difficulties, too, but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in Congress and the administration itself.
No single bill this year includes more discretionary spending for domestic programs and, apart from the space station, the measure incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market. 

The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration is increased to $124,875 during fiscal 1990.
And in anticipation of increased lending, the cap on FHA loan guarantees would rise to approximately $73.8 billion. 

Separately, the bill gives authority to the Department of Housing and Urban Development to facilitate the refinancing of high-interest loans subsidized by the government under the so-called Section 235 home-ownership program for lower-income families.
This provision met early and strong resistance from investment bankers worried about disruptions in their clients' portfolios.
But the promise of at least $15 million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between HUD Secretary Jack Kemp and lawmakers wanting to protect their projects elsewhere. 

The estimated $1.8 billion for the space station would be double last year's level, and total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would grow 16% to nearly $12.4 billion.
A string of costly projects, including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite, would continue to be developed within these limits.
And while imposing a statutory cap of $1.6 billion on future spending, the bill would give NASA $30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission, a successor to the Voyager space probe. 

Separately, the National Science Foundation is promised a 7.7% increase to bring its appropriations to $2.07 billion.
And while pursuing these initiatives, Congress and the White House are squeezed too by steady increases -- $551 million -- in veteran's medical care. 

The result is that all sides resort to sleight of hand to make room for competing housing and environmental programs, and the commitments now will drive excess spending into fiscal 1991. 

Senior members of the House Budget Committee are reduced in frustration to raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills, yet admit that much of the disorder now stems from the fiscal legerdemain associated with their own summit agreement with the White House this past spring. "It's hard to get the administration's attention on anything," said Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.), "because the whole agreement was built on gimmickry." 

Among the subsidies continued in the transportation bill is $30.7 million to maintain commercial air service for an estimated 92 communities, often in rural areas.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) strongly resisted deeper cuts sought by the House.
But at a time when the White House wants to kill the entire program, Republicans have been among its leading champions. 

Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, used his influence to preserve more than $132,000 in subsidies for air service to Sante Fe, N.M., and more than $2.1 million would go for service to eight communities in the western Nebraska district of GOP Rep. Virginia Smith on the House Appropriations Committee. 

GP Express, an independent airline serving much of Nebraska, estimates that nearly 40% of its revenues come from the subsidies that, in some cases, exceed the cost of a ticket.
For example, a passenger can fly from Chardon, Neb., to Denver for as little as $89 to $109, according to prices quoted by the company.
But given the few number of users, the cost to the federal government per passenger is estimated at $193, according to House and Senate appropriations committees. 

The House action yesterday came as the Senate remained mired in difficulties over a $17.25 billion measure covering the budgets for the State, Commerce, and Justice departments in fiscal 1990.
The compromise bill passed the House last week but has now provoked jurisdictional fights with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which jealously protects its prerogatives over operations at the State Department. 

The same jealousy can breed confusion, however, in the absence of any authorization bill this year.
House and Senate appropriators sought to establish a Nov. 30 deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed.
But on a 53-45 roll call this provision was stripped from the bill last night after Foreign Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.) complained that it was an intrusion on exclusive powers vested in his panel for more than three decades. 

Marks & Spencer PLC reported a 12% gain in first-half pretax profit, mainly because of improving performances in the U.K. and continental Europe. 

In the six months ended Sept. 30, pretax profit at the British clothing and food retailer rose to #208.7 million ($330.1 million) from #185.5 million a year ago. 

The results surpassed analysts' forecasts, which averaged around #200 million, and Marks & Spencer responded in trading on London's Stock Exchange with an eight pence rise to 188 pence. 

Profit after tax and minority interest but before extraordinary items rose 12% to #135.2 million; per-share earnings rose to five pence from 4.5 pence. 

Marks declared an interim per-share dividend of 1.85 pence, compared with 1.7 pence a year earlier. 

Sales increased 11% to #2.5 billion from #2.25 billion, while operating profit climbed 13% to #225.7 million from #199.8 million. 

Sales in North America and the Far East were inflated by acquisitions, rising 62% to #278 million.
Operating profit dropped 35%, however, to #3.8 million.
Brooks Brothers, which Marks bought last year, saw operating profit drop in half to #5 million. 

Critics of program trading are calling increasingly for regulators to raise the cost of trading stock-index futures. 

The idea: Boost the amount of cash required initially to buy or sell a stock-index futures contract from the relatively low current level of about 7% of the contract's value to as much as 50%, the same amount investors must put up to buy stocks. 

Such a move would curb speculation in stock-index futures, the critics contend, and that would stop the stock market's breathtaking surges and plunges. 

But futures traders here argue this cure is worse than the volatility disease.
They warn that raising the costs of trading futures could backfire and end up making stocks even more volatile. 

The debate over program trading is tearing Wall Street asunder.
Critics are much more aggressive than they were in 1987, the last time the controversy raged this heatedly.
They're also more effective.
Several big Wall Street securities firms have bowed to pressure and pulled back in recent days from stock-index arbitrage, the form of program trading that many accuse of amplifying, if not actually causing, stock-market volatility. 

In stock-index arbitrage, computer-assisted traders buy and sell large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index futures, profiting from fleeting price discrepancies between the two markets.
The 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Oct. 13, followed by an 80-point rebound in the next trading session, set off the current outcry against program trading. 

Chicago futures traders, knowing they can't escape the critics' wrath, are bracing for trouble.
They got a taste of it yesterday morning in full-page ads in major newspapers, including this paper, in which Neuberger & Berman, a big money New York manager, demanded federal regulators "immediately" boost margins on stock-index futures to 50%. 

The term "margin" has slightly different meanings in the stock and futures markets, but they both describe the amount of cash investors must put up to get into the game.
Stock margins are literally down payments made toward the purchase of a stock, and the level is set by the Federal Reserve Board.
In the futures market, a margin payment is simply a good faith deposit.
Each exchange sets its own minimums, with oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 

Margin requirements loom large in the program trading debate.
Because a trader can control $100 in market value for $7 cash in the futures market -- rather than for $50 in the stock market -- critics contend that speculation is encouraged to a degree that would be prohibitively expensive in stocks alone.
And with the markets linked so closely through arbitrage, speculation in futures is translated quickly into stocks. 

But raising stock-index futures margins could make the stock market even more volatile, futures traders contend.
Higher margins would price many professional speculators -- whose trades help futures markets function smoothly -- out of business.
If these speculators can't afford to trade as actively as before, stock-index futures prices, and therefore stock prices, may have to fall further than they might otherwise to attract buyers. 

"If you drive away the specs, then prices will fall in both futures and stocks," declared the head of one Chicago Mercantile Exchange member firm who asked not to be named, reflecting the highly charged debate over program trading. 

Another consequence of driving out speculators here, traders say, could be to widen the momentary price differences between stocks and stock-index futures that entice index arbitragers in the first place.
That could trigger wide price swings and more, not less, stock-index arbitrage. 

"If you decrease the liquidity in the futures market, you increase the discrepancies between stocks and futures," said Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty-First Securities Corp. 

Opponents of index arbitrage trading don't lose much sleep over the prospect of futures speculators being driven out of the market.
They argue that raising the cost of trading stock-index futures would eventually choke off price-jarring arbitrage trades between stocks and futures and increase the stability of stock prices. 

"You would diminish the impact of stock-index arbitrage enormously if you change the margin requirements for futures," said Richard Cantor, chief investment officer for Neuberger & Berman, which manages $17.5 billion in client funds. 

Mr. Cantor said that it was difficult to quantify the impact of stock index arbitrage on the performance of Neuberger & Berman -- whose tax-exempt accounts are lagging broad market averages so far this year -- or of other institutional investors.
But he echoed the complaints of other money managers in claiming that stock-index arbitrage has tended to "commoditize securities, shifting from a focus on earnings and assets to a trading focus." 

Raising stock-index futures margins sharply could curtail the volume of index arbitrage trading by the handful of Wall Street securities firms that dominate the business.
But these firms, many of whom say they have already quit doing index arbitrage trades for their own accounts, are especially resourceful when it comes to taking advantage of profitable opportunities.
A few firms, while claiming not to trade for their own accounts, are effectively doing just that in the guise of executing customer orders, then quietly splitting the profits with their customers, futures traders say. 

Tax-exempt institutional investors don't trade on margin, and therefore wouldn't be affected by an increase in stock-index futures margins. 

Raising stock-index futures margins sharply wouldn't have much of an effect on S&P 500 futures traders known as locals.
They often trade opposite brokerage firms, but as long as they don't carry positions overnight, they effectively trade without putting any money down. 

Futures industry officials here -- who fear the program-trading debate might turn into an attack on the futures markets themselves -- raise the specter of foreign competition when they argue against the kinds of changes critics are proposing. 

"If futures margins are raised substantially, some other country will allow lower margins, and that's where the business will go," said Barry Lind, chairman of Lind-Waldock & Co., a futures broker. 

Under attack by its own listed companies and powerful floor traders, the New York Stock Exchange is considering reinstituting a "collar" on program trading that it abandoned last year, according to people familiar with the Big Board. 

The exchange also may step up its disclosure of firms engaged in program trading, these people said. 

Big Board officials wouldn't comment publicly.
But in an interview in which he called the stock market's volatility a "national problem," Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said, "We are going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term" to help the situation. 

Mr. Phelan has been viewed by many exchange members as being indifferent to stock-price swings caused by program trades.
He said he is "very surprised" by the furor over program trading and the exchange's role in it that has raged in recent days. 

Mr. Phelan said that the Big Board has been trying to deal quietly with the issue, but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely, as some investors want, would be like "taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse." 

The exchange has a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow, and it is expected that some public announcement could be made after that. 

Big Board officials have been under seige from both investors and the exchange's own floor traders since the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 190-point tumble on Oct. 13.
Mr. Phelan hasn't been making public remarks in recent days, and many people have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue. 

What the Big Board is considering is re-establishing a "collar" on program trading when the market moves significantly.
Early last year, after a 140-point, one-day drop in the Dow, the Big Board instituted the collar, which banned program trading through the Big Board's computers whenever the Dow moved 50 points up or down in a day.
It didn't work. 

"The collar was penetrated on a number of occasions," meaning securities firms figured out ways to conduct program trades to circumvent the collar and use the Big Board's electronic trading system, Mr. Phelan said.
That was when the exchange took a new tack by publishing monthly statistics listing the top 15 program trading firms. 

Exchange officials emphasized that the Big Board is considering a variety of actions to deal with program trading.
People familiar with the exchange said another idea likely to be approved is expanding the monthly reports on program trading to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program trading and who was doing it. 

Meanwhile, another big Wall Street brokerage firm joined others that have been pulling back from program trading.
American Express Co. 's Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit said it ceased all index-arbitrage program trading for client accounts.
In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy and sell large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies between the two markets. 

Shearson, which in September was the 11th-biggest program trader on the Big Board, had already suspended stock-index arbitrage for its own account. 

Also, CS First Boston Inc. 's First Boston Corp. unit, the fifth-biggest program trader in September, is "preparing a response" to the program-trading outcry, officials of the firm said.
First Boston is one of the few major Wall Street firms that haven't pulled back from program trading in recent days. 

Mr. Phelan is an adroit diplomat who normally appears to be solidly in control of the Big Board's factions.
But he has been getting heat from all sides over program trading. 

Mr. Phelan's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange's stock specialists, who make markets in individual stocks, and from many companies that have shares listed on the Big Board. 

Mr. Phelan said that his predicting continued volatility is just "how the world is.
If bringing the message is a crime, I'm guilty of it." But he said this doesn't mean he is satisfied with the market's big swings. 

"We're trying to take care of a heck of a lot of constituents," Mr. Phelan said. "Each one has a different agenda." 

For example, in a special meeting Monday with Mr. Phelan, senior officials of some of the Big Board's 49 stock specialist firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests. "We are looking for representation we haven't had," a specialist said. "We've had dictation." 

After another session Mr. Phelan held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and First Boston -- all of which have engaged in program trading -- an executive of a top brokerage firm said, "Clearly, the firms want the exchange to take leadership." 

Many specialist firms resent the Big Board's new "basket" product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in one shot.
Ultimately, the specialists view this as yet another step toward electronic trading that could eventually destroy their franchise. 

"His {Phelan's} own interests are in building an electronic marketplace," said a market maker. 

The basket product, while it has got off to a slow start, is being supported by some big brokerage firms -- another member of Mr. Phelan's splintered constituency. 

Mr. Phelan has had difficulty convincing the public that the Big Board is serious about curbing volatility, especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for $200 billion in stock-index funds, which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500, and which sometimes employ program trading.
The Big Board wants to keep such index funds from fleeing to overseas markets, but only as long as it "handles it intelligently," Mr. Phelan said. 

Despite what some investors are suggesting, the Big Board isn't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures, exchange officials said.
Most revisions it will propose will be geared toward slowing down program trading during stressful periods, said officials working with the exchange.
Computers have made trading more rapid, but that can be fixed with some fine-tuning. "I think if you {can} speed things up, you can slow them down," Mr. Phelan said. "That's different than wrecking them." 

While volatility won't go away, he said, "Volatility is greater than program trading.
What I'm trying to say to people is, it's proper to worry about program trading, but it's only a piece of the business." 

For example, Mr. Phelan said that big institutions have so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market, regardless of index arbitrage. "A lot of people would like to go back to 1970," before program trading, he said. "I would like to go back to 1970.
But we're not going back to 1970." 

Indeed, Mr. Phelan said that if stock-market volatility persists, the U.S. may lose its edge as being the best place to raise capital. "Japan's markets are more stable," he said. "If that continues, a significant number of {U.S.} companies will go over there to raise money." 

In coming days, when the Big Board formulates its responses to the program-trading problem, Mr. Phelan may take a more public role in the issue. 

Lewis L. Glucksman, vice chairman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said: "This is a problem that's taking on a life of its own.
The program trading situation seems to have driven individual investors as well as others out of the market, and even Europeans are suspicious.
The exchange should take a pro-active position." 

For now, however, Mr. Phelan said: "I refuse to get out there and tell everybody everything is hunky-dory.
We have a major problem, and that problem is volatility."

Philip Morris Cos. is launching a massive corporate advertising campaign that will put the tobacco giant's name in TV commercials for the first time since the early 1950s, when it stopped advertising its namesake cigarette brand on television. 

The campaign, a patriotic celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, doesn't mention cigarettes or smoking; cigarette ads have been prohibited on television since 1971.
But even before it begins, the campaign is drawing fire from anti-smoking advocates, who criticize Philip Morris's attempt to bolster its beleaguered image by wrapping itself in the document that is a cornerstone of American democracy. 

Philip Morris, which became the U.S.'s largest food company last year with its $12.9 billion acquisition of Kraft Inc., seems determined to evolve beyond its roots in Marlboro country.
The company's research suggests that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low, although its array of brands -- including Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O, Cheez Whiz, and Miller beer -- blanket supermarket shelves. 

The company is expected to spend about $30 million a year on its two-year corporate campaign, created by WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather unit in New York.
The initial spots will appear during morning and prime-time news shows.
Philip Morris hopes that by taking its Bill of Rights theme to the airwaves, in addition to publications, it will reach the broadest possible audience.
Until now, its corporate ads, mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts, have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines. 

"Most people -- whether in Toledo, Tucson or Topeka -- haven't got a clue who we are," says Guy L. Smith, Philip Morris's vice president of corporate affairs. "If they think well of the company through our support of the Bill of Rights, it follows they'll think well of our products." Mr. Smith says the Bill of Rights commercial, which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression, isn't designed to have any special appeal for smokers.
Although Philip Morris typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with free-choice arguments, "this has nothing to do with cigarettes, nor will it ever," the spokesman says. 

But some anti-smoking activists disagree, expressing anger at what they see as the company's attempt to purchase innocence by association. "I'm outraged because this company is portraying itself at the heart of American culture and political freedom and in fact it's a killer," says Michael Pertschuk, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and a tobacco-industry critic. "It should be treated like the Medellin {drug} mafia, not the Founding Fathers." 

Mr. Pertschuk adds that the new commercial dovetails perfectly with major aspects of Philip Morris's political strategy.
These include trying to protect its print advertising by invoking the First Amendment, and wooing blacks by portraying itself as a protector of civil rights. (The commercial features, among others, the voice of Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader.) 

Many marketers say Philip Morris's approach will be effective, but they agree that the ads' implied smoking message is unmistakable. "This is clever, subliminal advertising that really says, `Smokers have rights, too, '" says Al Ries, chairman of Trout & Ries Inc., a Greenwich, Conn., marketing strategy firm. "This is designed to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking franchise." 

Richard Winger, a partner at Boston Consulting Group, adds: "It's very popular to drape yourself in the flag these days.
If you can do that and at the same time send a message that supports your business, that's brilliant." 

RJR Nabisco Inc. and American Brands Inc. say they have no plans to follow Philip Morris's lead. (Indeed, RJR Nabisco is currently under fire for having sent 80-second videotapes touting its Now brand to consumers who smoke American Brands' Carltons.) 

Despite the criticism, Philip Morris's corporate campaign runs little risk of getting yanked off the tube. "They aren't showing James Madison taking a puff or lighting up," says Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University. "All they are trying to do is borrow some of the legitimacy of the Bill of Rights itself." 

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said unconsolidated pretax earnings in the fiscal first half surged 79% to a record 63.25 billion yen ($445.7 million), reflecting strong demand for a variety of products. 

In the period ended Sept. 30, net income rose 90% to 31.18 billion yen, or 9.34 yen a share, from 16.38 billion yen, or 5.05 yen a share.
A year ago, the Tokyo company had pretax profit of 35.38 billion yen. 

Sales amounted to 1.011 trillion yen, climbing 29% from 787.02 billion yen. 

Encouraged by the brisk performance, Mitsubishi plans to raise its per-share dividend to 3.50 yen from three yen. 

Company officials said the current robust domestic demand that has been fueling sustained economic expansion helped push up sales of products like ships, steel structures, power systems and machinery and resulted in sharply higher profit. 

Lyphomed Inc., Rosemont, Ill., and Medco Research Inc., Los Angeles, said the Food and Drug Administration granted full marketing approval for a new drug for the treatment of a condition in which the heart beats between 150 and 200 beats a minute. 

The condition, known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, leads to dizziness and fainting.
The typical healthy heart beats 70 times a minute. 

The drug, called adenocard, returns the heart to a normal rhythm within seconds, according to Lyphomed. 

Medco Research developed the drug and licensed it to Lyphomed for sale in the U.S. and Canada. 

Every workday at 11 a.m., 40-year-old Mike Sinyard dons cycling clothes, hops on a bike he keeps at his Morgan Hill, Calif., office and sets out to cover a distance most people would travel only by car.
As many as 50 of his employees at Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ride with him.
When they return to their desks at 1 p.m., they have pedaled 20 miles. 

Such fervor for cycling helped Mr. Sinyard build a creative company at the forefront of its industry.
Founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen, Specialized spotted the appeal of fat-tired bikes that go almost anywhere and began mass-producing them in 1981.
In the past five years, the company's sales have grown to $80 million from $26 million.
Today, so-called mountain bikes account for two-thirds of the $2 billion spent annually on all bicycles in the U.S.
With 65% of its sales coming from mountain bikes, Specialized is widely considered to be a market leader. (Accessories, largely for mountain-bike users, account for much of the rest of sales.) 

But today, the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever.
One large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market Specialized helped create, turning out mountain bikes with such well-known names as Schwinn, Peugeot, Raleigh and Nishiki. 

Thus, Mr. Sinyard's company must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them, by developing new products specifically for mountain biking.
At the same time, though, it must become more structured to better manage its growth.
Accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a unicycle. 

It is a problem common to small companies that have grown fast -- especially when their success attracts big-time competitors. "The big word around Specialized is passion," says Erik Eidsmo, a former ski-industry executive whom Mr. Sinyard recruited from Citicorp to run marketing and sales. "What I hope to bring to this is another word: process.
That's my challenge.
It's Mike's challenge as well." 

Mr. Eidsmo is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry who were hired to bring the free-wheeling, fast-growing company under tighter control. "We had a lot of problems," Mr. Sinyard says.
While the company's sales were soaring, "We still had a system that was probably appropriate for $10 million to $20 million in sales." Adds Mr. Eidsmo, "What felt good that day was done that day." 

Since his arrival in May, Mr. Eidsmo has put in place techniques learned while working for Citicorp, such as management-by-objective, detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends. "We're finally getting -- and it's been very painful -- some understanding of what the company's long-term horizon should begin to look like," Mr. Eidsmo says. "But it's risky," he says of Specialized's attempt to adopt a corporate structure. "You don't want to lose the magic" of the company's creative drive. 

Hoping to stay ahead of the pack, the company is emphasizing innovation.
At a recent trade show, convention-goers lined up to view a new Specialized bike frame that weighs just 2.7 pounds -- a pound less than the lightest mountain-bike frame on the market.
By replacing the frame's steel lugs with titanium ones, Mr. Sinyard's company plans to make its next generation of frames even lighter. 

At the trade show, Specialized also unveiled a revolutionary three-spoked bike wheel developed jointly by Specialized and Du Pont Co. Made of space-age materials, the wheel spokes are designed like airplane wings to shave 10 minutes off the time of a rider in a 100-mile race, the company claims.
It currently costs $750, though Mr. Sinyard thinks the price can be reduced within three years to between $200 and $250.
He was able to slash the price of the company's least expensive mountain bike to $279 from $750 in 

But demands on the company's creativity are certain to grow.
Competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain-bike market Mr. Sinyard's company once had virtually all to itself.
U.S. Cycling Federation official Philip Milburn says mountain biking is "growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this." 

One especially coveted Specialized market the new players are targeting is mountain-bike accessories, which Mr. Eidsmo calls "the future of our business." Accessories not only sell faster than whole bikes, they also offer profit margins nearly double the 25% to 30% or so on sales of complete cycles.
To get a piece of the business, Nike Inc., Beaverton, Ore., introduced a line of mountain-bike shoes.
About a month ago, Michelin Tire Corp., Greenville, S.C., began selling mountain-bike tires, for years a Specialized stronghold. 

Competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too.
Trek Bicycle Corp., which accounts for one-quarter of the $400 million in annual sales at its Milwaukee-based parent, Intrepid Corp., entered the mountain-bike business in 1983.
Trek previously made only traditional road bikes, but "it didn't take a rocket scientist to change a road bike into a mountain bike," says Trek's president, Dick Burke.
The segment now makes up roughly two-thirds of his company's total sales. 

At Giant Bicycle Inc., Rancho Dominguez, Calif., sales have tripled since the company entered the U.S. mountain-bike business in 1987.
A subsidiary of a Taiwanese holding company with world-wide sales of $150 million, Giant is one example of the sudden globalization of Mr. Sinyard's once-cozy market niche.
Schwinn Bicycle Co., Chicago, established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland China and Hungary to sell bikes.
In the past year, Derby International Corp., Luxembourg, has acquired such major brands as Peugeot, Raleigh and Nishiki. 

In response to the internationalization of the business, Mr. Sinyard's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries.
The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give Specialized more control over marketing and sales.
But as Bill Austin, Giant's president, puts it, "With some of the bigger players consolidating their strength, the game has changed." 

The head of British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. said he hopes to raise about #450 million ($711 million) before the satellite-TV venture makes its delayed debut next spring -- with a major chunk coming from new investors. 

"We'll raise it through bank loans.
We'll raise it through {new} equity.
And we'll raise it through existing shareholders" as well as through junk bonds, said Anthony Simonds-Gooding, the private consortium's chief executive.
He said he believes the bank loan, to be arranged by February, will supply about half of the financing.
British Satellite, which already has raised #423.5 million from 10 backers, initially expected to seek an additional #400 million. 

Mr. Simonds-Gooding said the additional financing may leave British Satellite owned by about 20 investors, including Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond, whose nearly 36% stake would be reduced to as little as 20%. 

Bond Corp., British Satellite's biggest investor, would like to withdraw from the satellite-TV consortium, and analysts have speculated Hollywood studios might buy the Bond stake.
But Mr. Simonds-Gooding said he isn't talking to any studios about investing. 

Besides Bond Corp., British Satellite's other backers include Pearson PLC, Reed International PLC and Granada Group PLC.
The consortium faced a setback in May when technical problems forced it to postpone the September launch until next spring.
Continued uncertainty about the timing of the consortium's debut could make it hard to find a #450 million cash injection. 

Mr. Simonds-Gooding conceded that British Satellite's potential U.K. lenders "are saying, `When you're on the air, you'll {actually} get the money. '" The bankers also insist that the loans depend on the consortium raising more money from new and existing backers. 

British Satellite today is unveiling a #30 million advertising and promotional drive for the consortium's planned five channels of movies, sports, entertainment and news shows.
As part of the drive, the first 50,000 viewers who put up #10 each will get a package valued at #170 -- including a satellite receiving dish, equipment installation and a three-month subscription to its pay-movie service. 

British Satellite faces competition from Sky Television, a satellite-TV venture begun last February and owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
The rivals currently are locked in a costly bidding contest for Hollywood film rights. 

Ogden Projects Inc. said net income jumped to $6.6 million, or 18 cents a share, in the third quarter. 

The Fairfield, N.J., company, which is 92%-owned by Ogden Corp., New York, had net of $1.1 million, or four cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue soared to $101.7 million from $39.5 million. 

Ogden Projects, whose shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in August, closed yesterday at $26.875, down 75 cents.
The stock began trading this summer at $14 apiece. 

Ogden Projects, which has interests in solid-waste recovery and hazardous-waste cleanup, said it has 13 facilities in operation, up from seven a year ago. 

Meanwhile, Ogden Corp., which also has interests in building maintenance and management, reported third-quarter net income of $27.1 million, or 67 cents a share, more than twice the $13.5 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 33% to $378.1 million from $283.8 million. 

Carl E. Pfeiffer, chief executive officer, was named to the additional post of chairman of this specialty-metals manufacturing concern.
Robert C. Snyder, a director and chief operating officer of the company, succeeds Mr. Pfeiffer as president.

LUTHER BURBANK CROSS-BRED PLANTS to produce the billion-dollar Idaho potato.
Bioengineers set out to duplicate that feat -- scientifically and commercially -- with new life forms. 

In 1953, James Watson and his colleagues unlocked the double helix of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the genetic key to heredity.
Twenty years later, two California academics, Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer, made "recombinant" DNA, transplanting a toad's gene into bacteria, which then reproduced toad genes. 

When Boyer met Robert Swanson, an M.I.T.-trained chemist-turned-entrepreneur in 1976, they saw dollar signs.
With $500 apiece and an injection of outside capital, they formed Genentech Inc. Commercial gene-splicing was born. 

Genentech's first product, a brain protein called somatostatin, proved its technology.
The next to be cloned, human insulin, had market potential and Genentech licensed it to Eli Lilly, which produced 80% of the insulin used by 1.5 million U.S. diabetics. 

Their laboratory credentials established, Boyer and Swanson headed for Wall Street in 1980.
At the time, Genentech had only one profitable year behind it (a modest $116,000 on revenue of $2.6 million in 1979) and no product of its own on the market.
Nonetheless, the $36 million issue they floated in 1980 opened at $35 and leaped to $89 within 20 minutes. 

The trip from the test tube was not without snags.
Boyer and Cohen, for instance, both still university researchers, had to be talked into applying for a patent on their gene-splicing technique -- and then the Patent Office refused to grant it.
That judgment, in turn, was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, leaving Cohen and Boyer holding the first patents for making recombinant DNA (now assigned to their schools). 

Gene-splicing now is an integral part of the drug business.
Genentech's 1988 sales were $335 million, both from licensing and its own products. 

Bouygues S.A., a diversified construction concern based in Paris, said its consolidated profit for the 1989 first half, after payments to minority interests, surged to 188 million French francs ($30.2 million) from 65 million francs a year earlier. 

Revenue rose 21% to 22.61 billion francs from 18.69 billion francs. 

The company didn't specify reasons for the strong earnings gain.
But Bouygues said its first-half profit isn't indicative of the full-year trend because of the highly seasonal nature of many of the company's activities. 

For all of 1988, Bouygues had consolidated profit of 519 million francs, after payments to minority interests, on revenue of 50 billion francs.
The group has forecast 1989 revenue of 56.9 billion francs. 

First Federal Bancorp Inc. said James Clarkson, its chairman, president and chief executive officer, retired effective yesterday.
The company also said its board recently instituted a review of internal policies and procedures, including activities conducted by Mr. Clarkson. 

First Federal said Mr. Clarkson, 65 years old, is "fully cooperating in the continuing review." 

"None of the activities being reviewed has any adverse effect on the financial condition of the bank or its depositors," First Federal Savings Bank & Trust's president, Leo D. Ottoni, said.
First Federal Savings is a subsidiary of First Federal Bancorp. 

The company declined to disclose further details, but said that the inquiry is continuing and that it wasn't forced by banking regulators.
First Federal said no further announcements are expected before the review is finished. 

First Federal named Mr. Ottoni president and chief executive to succeed Mr. Clarkson and elected him as a director.
The post of chairman will remain vacant indefinitely, a company spokesman said.
Earlier this month Mr. Ottoni, 64, was named acting president and chief executive of the holding company and the savings bank unit.
Previously he had been senior vice president in charge of the savings bank's trust division. 

American Enterprise Institute scholar Norman Ornstein in the Oct. 21 TV Guide on "What TV News Doesn't Report About Congress -- and Should": 

By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise, Wright and Tower, the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution. . . . An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works -- and why voters in, say, West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not.
But nobody did such a piece, reflecting a contemporary axiom: the more a scandal has to do with a congressman's duties as a congressman, the less likely it is to catch the fancy of a network. 

Ethicist Michael Josephson, in one of his institute's recent publications on "Journalism: In the Year 2000": 

The operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal, sensitive and intimate facts.
Traditional standards of relevancy and importance ("is this something the public ought to know") will be replaced by a much broader test ("is this something the public is interested in knowing").
And, since the public has always been fascinated by gossip and voyeurism, reporters and editors will strain for creative angles to justify the inclusion of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships, activities of family members, and all matters about mental and physical health.
Similarly, visual images will be more vivid, sensational and, sometimes, gruesome.
One consequence of the trend toward tabloid standards of taste will be fierce attacks from politicians who will find sufficient evidence of abuse to arouse an already cynical public to control the press. 

After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation's health-care system, Bert Seidman of the AFL-CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter: big business. 

Corporate leaders, frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs, are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats.
Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could "lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance," Arthur Puccini, a General Electric Co. vice president, warned earlier this year. 

The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus.
Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs, improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance. 

Agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program, and nobody expects the U.S. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system.
But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine. "I can't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is," says Mr. Seidman, who heads the AFL-CIO's department dealing with health matters. 

Because the Bush administration isn't taking the initiative on health issues, business executives are dealing with congressional Democrats who champion health-care revision. "Business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue," says Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.). "It's a bottom-line issue." Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but doesn't contain cost-control measures.
Partly in response, a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support.
It will feature a cost-containment provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices. 

At 11.1% of gross national product, U.S. health costs already are the highest in the world.
By contrast, Japan's equal 6.7% of GNP, a nation's total output of goods and services.
Management and labor worry that the gap makes U.S. companies less competitive. 

Chrysler Corp. estimates that health costs add $700 to the price of each of its cars, about $300 to $500 more per car than foreign competitors pay for health. "The cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength," complains Walter Maher, a Chrysler health-and-benefits specialist. 

Labor is upset because many companies are using higher employee insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments to deflect surging medical costs to workers.
Health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against Pittston Co. and Nynex Corp.
In their new contract this year, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the Communications Workers of America agreed to look for "prompt and lasting national solutions" to rising health-care costs. 

Some analysts are cynical about the new corporate interest in health-care overhaul.
Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, scoffs at "capitalists who want to socialize the entire financing system" for health. "They hope they can buy some government cost discipline," but this is a false hope, Mr. Schramm says.
He asserts that government has done an even worse job of controlling its health bill than business. 

So far neither the Bush administration nor Congress is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care.
The administration lacks a comprehensive health-care policy.
Congress still is struggling to dismantle the unpopular Catastrophic Care Act of 1988, which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage. 

A bipartisan commission established by Congress and headed by Sen. John Rockefeller (D., W.Va.) is scheduled to present new plans for dealing with the uninsured and long-term care for the elderly by next March 1.
A quadrennial commission appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is taking a broad look at the economics of Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor and the health system in general.
It is expected to report next summer. 

"No magic bullet will be discovered next year, an election year," says Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.) But 1991 could be a window for action.
The pressure for change will rise with costs. "I think employers are really going to be the ones to push for major change," says Sharon Canner, a health expert at NAM. 

Any major attempt to revamp the health-care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups, particularly the American Medical Association, and perhaps from the public as well, if Congress takes steps that patients fear will limit the availability of care. 

The NAM embraces efforts, which both the administration and the medical profession have begun, to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines.
Advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures.
HHS Secretary Sullivan estimates that as much as 25% of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary. 

Limiting care won't be easy or popular. "To slow the rise in total spending, it will be necessary to reduce per-capita use of services," the NAM warns in a policy statement.
This will "require us to define -- and redefine -- what is `necessary' or `appropriate' care.
This involves trade-offs and {it} cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is `necessary. '" 

The AFL-CIO also embraces treatment guidelines.
In addition, it's toying with an approach that would impose health-expenditure ceilings or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual states as a way to slow health-care spending.
At a meeting here on Nov. 15, the labor federation plans to launch a major effort to build grass-roots support for health-care overhaul. 

Earlier this year, President Bush made a final "take-it-or-leave it" offer on the minimum wage: an increase to $4.25 an hour over three years, and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job.
Now, the White House has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years.
The sub-minimum wage would apply only to first-time teen-age workers for 90 days.
The White House had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation.
The only permanent losers will be the 200,000 or so workers everyone agrees will be priced out of a job at the $4.25 rate Congress is likely to approve today.
It is compromises such as this that convince Washington's liberals that if they simply stay the course, this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues. 

Ardent Computer Corp. and Stellar Computer Inc. said they completed the merger that the closely held companies announced Aug. 30. 

The new company, called Stardent Computer Inc., also said it named John William Poduska, former chairman and chief executive of Stellar, to the posts of president and chief executive. 

Allen H. Michels, Ardent's former president and chief executive, was named chairman of the new company.
The two men had been serving as co-chairmen and co-chief executive officers. 

Stardent said it would combine its two product lines -- both high-performance graphics computers -- by the 1991 first quarter.
Stardent will be based in Newton, Mass., but will maintain its operations in Sunnyvale, Calif. 

DeSoto Inc. said it is dismissing 200 employees as part of a restructuring aimed at producing pretax savings of $10 million annually. 

Under the plan, DeSoto said it will sell certain assets and businesses that don't meet strategic and profitability objectives. 

The Des Plaines, Ill., chemical coatings concern, which has about 2,000 employees world-wide, said it plans to sell its domestic rigid container packaging and flexible adhesives businesses, and its Chicago Heights, Ill., resin plant. 

The company said it plans to use the sale proceeds to invest in business opportunities more closely identified with the company's "refocused direction." 

StatesWest Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., said it withdrew its offer to acquire Mesa Airlines because the Farmington, N.M., carrier didn't respond to its offer by the close of business yesterday, a deadline StatesWest had set for a response. 

However, StatesWest isn't abandoning its pursuit of the much-larger Mesa.
StatesWest, which has a 7.25% stake in Mesa, said it may purchase more Mesa stock or make a tender offer directly to Mesa shareholders. 

StatesWest had proposed acquiring Mesa for $7 a share and one share of a new series of StatesWest 6% convertible preferred stock it values at $3 a share.
Earlier, Mesa had rejected a general proposal from StatesWest to combine the two carriers in some way. 

StatesWest serves 10 cities in California, Arizona and Nevada.
Mesa flies to 42 cities in New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado and Texas. 

Bankers Trust New York Corp. won permission from the Federal Reserve Board to move the company's private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary. 

The seemingly mundane action, which was opposed by the Securities Industry Association, a trade group, has important implications for banks' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities.
The Fed's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite.
Several other banks have similar applications pending. 

Over the past two years, the Fed has given a handful of banks' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate, asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms.
Securities firms have challenged those Fed approvals, saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses. 

However, the Fed limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than 10% of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks, such as dealing in U.S. Treasurys. 

For some banks that 10% ceiling created problems.
But, by allowing BT Securities Inc. to handle private placements, the Fed boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do. 

Private placements involve debt and equity securities, typically in denominations of $1 million, that are sold to institutional investors and aren't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Last year, Bankers Trust said it placed $10 billion of corporate debt and equities privately. 

First Security Corp. said it tentatively agreed to acquire Deseret Bancorp. for stock valued at about $18 million. 

Terms call for First Security to issue about 0.55 share of its stock for each Deseret share held, or a total of about 550,000 First Security shares.
It has about 12.3 million shares outstanding. 

Deseret, with about $100 million in assets, is the parent of the Deseret Bank, which has six offices and headquarters at Pleasant Grove, Utah.
The purchase price is equal to about 1.65 times Deseret's roughly $10.7 million book value, or assets less liabilities. 

Salt Lake City-based First Security, with $5.4 billion in assets, said the agreement is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, and that it hopes to complete the transaction early next year. 

You'd think all the stories about well-heeled communities and developers getting HUD grants would prompt Congress to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies.
No way.
Congress has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for insured loans from the deficit-ridden Federal Housing Administration.
It appears that the only thing Congress is learning from the HUD story is how to enlarge its control of the honey pot going to special interests. 

Right now, the largest loan the FHA can insure in high-cost housing markets is $101,250.
Last week, housing lobbies persuaded Congress to raise the ceiling to $124,875, making FHA loans more accessible to the well-to-do.
But it does that at the cost of deepening the taxpayer's exposure if the FHA is forced to pay for more loans going sour.
This is no idle fearlast year the FHA lost $4.2 billion in loan defaults. 

But the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what Senator Alan Cranston and Majority Leader George Mitchell have in mind for housing.
The Senate Banking Committee will begin hearings next week on their proposal to expand existing federal housing programs.
Other Senators want to lower the down payments required on FHA-insured loans. 

That would be a formula for ensuring even more FHA red ink.
Experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a housing-loan default is the down payment.
Because a purchaser can use an FHA loan to finance all points and closing costs, the FHA can wind up lending more than a house is worth.
If housing prices continue to fall, many borrowers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses.
Much the same thing happened with busted S&Ls, a problem Congress just "solved" with a $166 billion bailout. 

We hear that HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is toying with going along with some of the Cranston-Mitchell proposals.
That sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next HUD tar pit.
A group of 27 Senators has written Mr. Kemp urging him to reject Cranston-Mitchell and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations.
But even if he agrees, Mr. Kemp doesn't write the nation's housing law -- Congress does.
And the majority of Members cynically view the current discrediting of HUD as mainly a chance to shove through their own slate of projects. 

Exhibit A is last week's House vote to fund 40 pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the HUD scandal.
None of the grants had been requested by HUD, judged competitively or were the subject of a single hearing. 

More and more observers now realize that the key to ending future HUD scandals lies in forcing Congress to clean up its own act.
This week, a Baltimore Sun editorial said the Lantos subcommittee on HUD should forget about Sam Pierce's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses: the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork-barrel projects.
The Sun concluded that Mr. Pierce is only part of the problem -- and a part that's gone. "If HUD is to be reformed," it concluded, Members of Congress will "have to start looking into, and doing something about, the practices of their colleagues." 

Of course, self-reform is about the last thing this Congress is interested in.
Proponents of expanding FHA programs say they merely want to help home buyers who are frozen out of high-priced markets.
But the FHA program is hemorrhaging bad loans.
Jack Kemp has submitted a package of reforms, and they are surely headed for the Capitol Hill sausage-grinder.
Like the S&L mess before it, this is a problem Congress should be solving, not ignoring. 

Bond prices staggered in seesaw trading, rising on reports of economic weakness and falling on reports of economic strength. 

Treasury bonds got off to a strong start, advancing modestly during overnight trading on foreign markets. 

"We saw good buying in Japan and excellent buying in London," said Jay Goldinger, market strategist and trader at Capital Insight Inc., Beverly Hills, Calif.
The market's tempo was helped by the dollar's resiliency, he said.
Late in London, the dollar was quoted at 1.8410 West German marks and 142.70 Japanese yen, up from late Monday in New York.
British sterling eased to $1.5775 from $1.5825. 

When U.S. trading began, Treasury bonds received an additional boost from news that sales of new single-family homes fell 14% in September.
The contraction was twice as large as economists projected and was the sharpest decline since a 19% drop in January 1982. 

Economists said the report raised speculation that the economic slowdown could turn into a recession, which would pave the way for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
But later in the day, a report by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago cast doubt on the recession scenario.
The association said its October index of economic activity rose to 51.6% after having been below 50% for three consecutive months.
A reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing industry is slowing while a reading above 50% suggests that the industry is expanding.
Bond prices fell after the Chicago report was released. 

By the end of the day, bond prices were mixed.
The benchmark 30-year bond was nearly 1/4 point higher, or up about $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
New two-year notes ended unchanged while three-year and four-year notes were slightly lower.
Municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/2 point higher while mortgage-backed securities were up about 1/8 point.
Corporate bonds were unchanged. 

In the corporate market, an expected debt offering today by International Business Machines Corp. generated considerable attention. 

The giant computer maker is slated to offer $500 million of 30-year non-callable debentures through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. Traders expect the bonds to yield about 0.60 to 0.65 percentage point above the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which ended Tuesday with a yield of about 7.90%. 

The last time IBM tapped the corporate debt market was in April 1988, when it offered $500 million of debt securities. 

IBM's visits to the debt market are closely watched by treasurers at other corporations and by credit market analysts.
Some analysts believe the company has the ability to pinpoint the trough in interest-rate cycles. 

In October 1979, just days before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, IBM offered $1 billion in debt securities.
The boost in rates sent IBM's bonds tumbling, leaving underwriters with millions of dollars of losses and triggering a sell-off in the overall market. 

The company "can't be bullish if they're doing a sizable 30-year bullet," said one analyst. 

Others said IBM might increase the size of the offering to as much as $1 billion if investor demand is strong.
The company has $1 billion in debt filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

"I think the $500 million is a little bit of a fire drill," said Jim Ednee, head of the industrial bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "I think as the pricing time arrives, the bonds will come a little richer and in a larger amount." 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury prices ended mixed in light trading. 

The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 102 12/32 to yield 7.90% compared with 102 7/32 to yield 7.92% Monday.
The latest 10-year notes were unchanged at 100 16/32 to yield 7.904%. 

Short-term rates also were mixed.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose slightly from the average rate at Monday's auction to 7.79% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.04%.
The discount rate on six-month Treasury bills fell slightly to 7.60% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.99%. 

Corporate Issues 

Two junk bond issues were priced yesterday, including a scaled-backed offering by Beatrice Co. 

A spokesman for underwriters Salomon Brothers Inc. said Beatrice cut its high-yield offering to $251 million from a planned $350 million after it became clear the company would have to give investors higher yields. 

In the two-part offering, $151 million of senior subordinated reset notes were priced at 99.75 and carried a rate of 13 3/4%, while the $100 million of senior subordinated floating rate notes were priced to float at 4.25 percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR.
The one-year LIBOR rate yesterday was 8 7/16%. 

Since the recent deterioration of the junk-bond market, at least two other junk issuers have said they plan to scale back planned high-yield offerings, and several issues have been postponed. 

William Carmichael, Beatrice chief financial officer, said favorable market conditions in September prompted the company to plan more debt than necessary. 

"However, given the changes in the market conditions that have occurred since then, we decided to sell only the amount needed to proceed with our contemplated recapitalization," he said. 

Under the firm's original bank credit agreement, it was required to raise $250 million of subordinated debt to be used to repay some of the bank borrowings drawn to redeem $526.3 million of increasing rate debentures in August. 

A month ago, when Beatrice first filed to sell debt, the company had planned to offer $200 million of its senior subordinated reset notes at a yield of 12 3/4%.
The $150 million in senior subordinated floating-rate notes were targeted to be offered at a price to float four percentage points above the three-month LIBOR.
By October, however, market conditions had deteriorated and the reset notes were targeted to be offered at a yield of between 13 1/4% and 13 1/2%. 

Mr. Carmichael said investors also demanded stricter convenants. 

Continental Cablevision Inc., via underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co., priced $350 million of junk bonds at par to yield 12 7/8%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

J.C. Penney & Co. issued $350 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables.
The securities were priced at 99.1875 to yield about 9.19%.
Underwriters at First Boston Corp. said the J.C. Penney credit-card securities are the first with a 10-year average life, which is much longer than previous such issues. 

Elsewhere, Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for November delivery was quoted at 98 18/32 bid, up 5/32 from late Monday, to yield about 9.333% to a 12-year average life assumption. 

Freddie Mac's 9 1/2% issue was quoted at 99 20/32, up 3/32 from Monday.
Fannie Mae's 9% issue was at 98 7/32, up 1/8. 

On the pricing front, an 11-class issue of $500 million Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Remic mortgage securities was launched by a Morgan Stanley group.
The offering is backed by Freddie Mac's 10% issue with a weighted average term to maturity of 29.583 months. 

Municipal Issues 

Municipal bonds were little changed to 1/2 point higher in late dealings. 

"We were oversold and today we bounced back.
Some accounts came in for some blocks in the secondary {market}, which we haven't seen for a while," said one trader. 

"There were no {sell} lists and the calendar is lightening up a bit.
There's light at the end of the tunnel for municipals," he said, adding that he expects prices to "inch up" in the near term. 

The market's tone improved after Monday's pricing of $813 million New York City general obligation bonds.
The issue's smooth absorption eased fears that supply would overwhelm demand in coming sessions, traders said.
Demand for the bonds was strong enough to permit underwriters to trim some yields in the tax-exempt portion of the offering late Monday. 

A two-part $75.1 million offering of wastewater treatment bonds by the New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust was more than half sold by late in the session, according to lead underwriter Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 

The debt was reoffered priced to yield from 6% in 1991 to 7.15% in 2008-2009. 

Foreign Bonds 

Most foreign government bonds markets were quiet. 

West German bonds firmed a bit after Monday's fall, but traders said the market remains bearish due to speculation that interest rates could rise again. 

In a speech given Friday but released late Monday, Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger suggested that it was risky to claim that the booming German economy has reached the peak of its cycle.
His comments were interpreted as a sign that higher interest rates are possible.
On Oct. 5, the Bundesbank raised the Lombard and discount rates by one percentage point to 8% and 6%, respectively, the highest levels in seven years. 

Germany's 7% bond due October 1999 was unchanged at 99.35 to yield 7.09% while the 6 3/4% notes due July 1994 rose 0.025 point to 97.275 to yield 7.445%.
Japanese government bonds showed little change. 

Japan's benchmark No. 111 issue due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.90, down 0.02 point, to yield 5.435%. 

British government bonds were little changed as investors awaited an address on economic policy by John Major, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 2/32 to 111 1/2 to yield 10.14% while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 21/32 to yield 12.95%. 

Rally's Inc. said it adopted a shareholders rights plan to protect shareholders from an inadequately priced takeover offer. 

The plan provides for the distribution of one common stock-purchase right as a dividend for each share of common outstanding.
Each right entitles shareholders to buy one-half share of common for $30. 

Earlier this month, a group led by three of the company's directors, Burt Sugarman, James M. Trotter III and Willam E. Trotter II, indicated it had a 45.2% stake in the Louisville, Ky., fast-food company and that it planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally's nine-member board. 

The company said it was "concerned about the announced intent to acquire control of the company" by a Sugarman-led group. 

Raw-steel production by the nation's mills decreased 3.4% last week to 1,754,000 tons from 1,816,000 tons the previous week, the American Iron and Steel Institute said. 

Last week's output fell 6.4% from the 1,874,000 tons produced a year earlier. 

The industry used 78.8% of its capability last week, compared with 81.6% the previous week and 87.4% a year ago. 

The capability utilization rate is a calculation designed to indicate at what percent of its production capability the industry is operating in a given week. 

BUSH AND GORBACHEV WILL HOLD two days of informal talks next month. 

The president said that he and the Kremlin leader would meet Dec. 2-3 aboard U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean to discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda.
A simultaneous announcement was made in Moscow.
Bush said that neither he nor Gorbachev expected any "substantial decisions or agreements." The seaborne meetings won't disrupt plans for a formal summit next spring or summer, at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed. 

The two leaders are expected to discuss changes sweeping the East bloc as well as human-rights issues, regional disputes and economic cooperation. 

Israel's army lifted a blockade around a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank, ending a 42-day campaign of seizing cars, furniture and other goods to crush a tax boycott.
While residents claimed a victory, military authorities said they had confiscated the equivalent of more than $1.5 million to make up for the unpaid taxes. 

East German leader Krenz arrived in Moscow for talks today with Gorbachev on restructuring proposals.
In East Berlin, Communist Party officials considered legalizing New Forum, the country's largest opposition alliance, as about 20,000 demonstrators staged protests in three cities to press demands for democratic freedoms. 

The House approved a permanent smoking ban on nearly all domestic airline routes as part of a $27.1 billion transportation bill that must still overcome budget obstacles in Congress.
The chamber also sent to Bush a nearly $67 billion fiscal 1990 measure that includes the first construction funds for a space station. 

Nicaragua's Ortega postponed until today a decision on whether to end a 19-month-old cease-fire in the conflict with the Contra rebels.
In Washington, the Senate voted to condemn Ortega's threat to cancel the truce, and Bush said he would review U.S. policy toward Managua, including the possibility of renewing military aid to the rebels. 

Chinese leader Deng told former President Nixon that the U.S. was deeply involved in "the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion" that gripped Beijing last spring.
Nixon, on the fourth day of a private visit to China, said that damage to Sino-U.S. relations was "very great," calling the situation "the most serious" since 1972. 

Afghanistan's troops broke through a guerrilla blockade on the strategic Salang Highway, allowing trucks carrying food and other necessities to reach Kabul after a missile attack on rebel strongholds.
The convoy of about 100 vehicles was the first to make deliveries to the capital in about 10 days. 

Turkey's legislature elected Prime Minister Ozal as the country's first civilian president since 1960, opening the way for a change of government under a new premier he will select.
The vote in Ankara was boycotted by opposition politicians, who vowed to oust Ozal.
He begins his seven-year term Nov. 9, succeeding Kenan Evren. 

South Africa's government dismissed demands by right-wing Conservatives, the nation's main opposition party, for emergency talks on Pretoria's recent tolerance of dissent.
The government also urged whites to refrain from panic over growing black protests, such as the massive anti-apartheid rally Sunday on the outskirts of Soweto. 

Researchers in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of crops, such as cotton, soybeans and rice.
The scientists at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. isolated a gene that could lead to a generation of plants possessing a high-production trait. 

A bomb exploded at a leftist union hall in San Salvador, killing at least eight people and injuring about 30 others, including two Americans, authorities said.
The blast, which wrecked the opposition labor group's offices, was the latest in a series of attacks in El Salvador's 10-year-old civil war. 

Hungary's Parliament voted to hold a national referendum on an election to fill the new post of president.
The balloting to decide when and how to fill the position, which replaces a collective presidency under a pact signed by the ruling Socialists and opposition groups, is to be held Nov. 

The State Department denied asylum to a Vietnamese man who escaped from his homeland by lashing himself to the rudder housing of a tanker for two days in monsoon seas.
A spokesman for Democratic Sen. Pell of Rhode Island said, however, that the Immigration and Naturalization Service would review the stowaway's request. 

West Germany will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of Jan. 1, 1991, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said. 

He said the government will also repeal the 1% transaction tax on the first-time purchase of stakes in companies. 

The announcement follows several comments by government officials that the government will speed up the repeal of the tax, which was originally scheduled to fall with the start of the single internal market in the European Community at the end of 1992. 

The securities-turnover tax has been long criticized by the West German financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of Frankfurt into rival financial centers, especially London, where trading transactions isn't taxed. 

The tax has raised less than one billion marks ($545.3 million) annually in recent years, but the government has been reluctant to abolish the levy for budgetary concerns.
In the interview, Mr. Haussmann didn't specify the amount of revenue the government will lose after the tax disappears. 

The new date means that the tax will be officially repealed before the end of the current parliamentary term at the end of 1990 and guarantees its abolition even if the current center-right coalition loses the elections in December 1990.

Federal and state thrift examiners said they saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the collapse of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, and a California regulator described an attempted "whitewash" by deputies of chief federal regulator Danny Wall. 

In a riveting day of hearings before the House Banking Committee, the examiners described finding shredded documents, a mysterious Panamanian subsidiary, millions of dollars funneled into a Swiss bank, and a complacent attitude by Mr. Wall's deputies, one of whom was portrayed as acting more like a public-relations man for the thrift than a federal regulator. 

A California official also said he sent the Federal Bureau of Investigation a packet of documents relating to a previously reported $400,000 contribution from Lincoln's parent solicited by Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.). 

Federal examiner Alex Barabolak said Lincoln's operations amounted to "pyramiding debt to provide a luxurious life style for its owners." Another federal examiner, John Meek, said Lincoln's principal owner, Charles Keating Jr., and his family drew off at least $34 million from the thrift in salaries, bonuses and proceeds from securities sales in the 3 1/2 years before federal authorities seized it earlier this year.
Lincoln's collapse may cost taxpayers as much as $2.5 billion, according to estimates, making it the most expensive thrift failure in history. 

"I think there's overwhelming evidence to indicate probable criminal activity," said Mr. Meek, who participated last year in an examination of the Irvine, Calif., thrift.
He said the evidence pointed to wrongdoing by Mr. Keating "and others," although he didn't allege any specific violation. 

Richard Newsom, a California state official who last year examined Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp., said he also saw evidence that crimes had been committed. "It sure smells like it," he said.
He said 30% of the loans he sampled were "dead meat on the day they were made." 

The state examiner also said supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed so reluctant to demand write-downs of Lincoln's bad loans that he immediately grew suspicious. 

"Later on, my concerns about a whitewash became even more serious," he said.
He called the sour loans "appalling" and added, "You opened the file up and it just jumped at you." 

Leonard Bickwit, a Washington attorney for Lincoln's parent corporation, said in an interview, "We deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers." 

"Those who testified {yesterday} have consistently maintained that anyone who didn't agree with them is part of a coverup, a whitewash, or the subject of excessive influence," Mr. Bickwit said. "We simply don't agree with that or the findings of their investigation." 

Mr. Wall's deputies complained that they hadn't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the Banking Committee's hearings, which Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) has used as a forum to flay Mr. Wall's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job. 

"A couple of things Mr. Newsom said were at least misleading," said Kevin O'Connell, one of the Washington regulators responsible for the handling of Lincoln.
In an interview, he said federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans the state regulator cited to be a total loss, and forced Lincoln to make an $18 million downward adjustment on another. 

"Our response to the whitewash would simply be, look what happened," another Washington official, Alvin Smuzynski, said in an interview.
Federal officials seized the association in April, a day after the parent corporation entered bankruptcy-law proceedings.
The government later brought a $1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others. 

Rep. Gonzalez has complained that regulators waited far too long, however, ignoring a recommendation from regional officials to place Lincoln into receivership two years before it failed. "He took the reckless course of ignoring the evidence," Rep. Gonzalez said. 

State thrift examiner Eugene Stelzer said he found the chief federal examiner Steve Scott to be totally uninterested in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions. "Frankly, it was like he worked for the Lincoln public-relations department," Mr. Stelzer testified.
And David Riley, a federal examiner who worked under Mr. Scott, said he found his chief oddly upbeat about Lincoln.
Asked to comment, a spokesman for Mr. Scott said: "Mr.
Scott has spoken to his attorney, who has advised him not to talk to anybody." 

Mr. Meek said that a day or two before Lincoln's parent entered bankruptcy proceedings, he and other examiners saw "a truck with a sign on it that said it was from the `Document Destruction Center. ' We observed at least two large plastic bags of shredded paper loaded into this truck." 

Mr. Bickwit said the paper had been donated to "a charitable organization that sells it for recycling.
They shredded it simply because it contained financial information about their creditors and depositors." 

Mr. Meek said his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by Lincoln, including $22 million paid to Credit Suisse of Switzerland, an $18 million interest in Saudi European Bank in Paris, a $17.5 million investment in a Bahamas trading company, and a recently discovered holding in a Panama-based company, Southbrook Holdings.
Mr. Bickwit said, "I can see why an S&L examiner would regard these as unusual activities," but said the overseas investments "essentially broke even" for the S&L. 

Private industry's labor costs rose 1.2% in the third quarter, matching the second-quarter pace, as health insurance costs continued to soar, the Labor Department said. 

The increase in wage and benefit costs in the third quarter was greater than the 1% rise reported for the third quarter of 1988. 

"Wage increases and overall compensation increases are beginning to curl upward a little bit," said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, a business research organization. 

"One would have thought this would have happened two or three years ago as the labor market tightened.
It is a considerably delayed reaction and it's not a severe one at all," she added. 

The new data underscored the severity of the nation's health-care cost problem.
In the 12 months ended in September, wages and salaries of private-sector workers rose 4.4%, while health insurance costs spurted by 13.7%.
The consumer price index climbed 4.3% in the same period. 

Despite the big increases in health-care costs, wages still account for a far greater share of overall labor costs.
The overall private-sector employment cost index, which includes both wages and benefits, rose 4.7% in the 12 months ended in September, compared with 4.5% for both the 12 months ended in June and the 12 months ended September 1988. 

Labor costs are climbing at a far more rapid pace in the health care industry than in other industries.
For instance, wages of private-sector hospital workers leaped 6.6% in the 12 months ended in September, compared with 4.4% for workers in all industries. 

In the third quarter, wages and salaries in all private industry rose 1.2%, compared with 1% increases in both the second quarter and in the third quarter of 1988. 

For the past five years, unions haven't managed to win wage increases as large as those granted to nonunion workers.
For private-sector union workers, the cost of wages and benefits rose 0.9% in the third quarter.
For nonunion workers, the costs rose 1.4%. 

Labor costs continued to rise more rapidly in service industries than in goods-producing industries, the report showed.
It also found them rising much more in the Northeast than elsewhere. 

Including employees of state and local -- but not the federal -- governments, the employment cost index rose 1.6% in the third quarter, compared with a 1.3% rise in the same quarter in 1988.
The index rose 1.1% in the second quarter. 

For the 12 months ended in September, this index was up 5.1%.
It rose 4.8% for the 12 months ended in June and 4.7% in the 12 months ended in September 1988. 

Unlike most economic indicators, none of these figures are adjusted for seasonal variations. 

Georgia-Pacific Corp. 's unsolicited $3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. was hailed by Wall Street despite a cool reception by the target company. 

William R. Laidig, Nekoosa's chairman, chief executive officer and president, characterized the $58-a-share bid as "uninvited" and said Nekoosa's board would consider the offer "in due course." 

T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview that all terms of the offer are negotiable.
He added that he had spoken with Mr. Laidig, whom he referred to as a friend, by telephone Monday evening. "I'm hopeful that we'll have further discussions," Mr. Hahn said. 

On Wall Street, takeover stock traders bid Nekoosa's stock well above the Georgia-Pacific bid, assuming that Nekoosa's will either be sold to a rival bidder or to Georgia-Pacific at a higher price -- as much as $75 a share, according to some estimates. 

Yesterday, Nekoosa common closed in composite New York Stock Exchange trading at $62.875, up $20.125, on volume of almost 6.3 million shares.
Georgia-Pacific closed down $2.50, at $50.875 in Big Board trading. 

Takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray, Georgia-Pacific's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed: namely, industrial companies can continue bidding for one another, but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing. 

"The way the world is shaping up, the strategic buyer is going to be the rule and the financial buyer is going to be the exception," said one trader. 

For the paper industry specifically, most analysts said the deal will spur a wave of paper-company takeovers, possibly involving such companies as Union Camp Corp., Federal Paperboard Co. and Mead Corp.
The analysts argued that Georgia-Pacific's offer, the first hostile bid ever among major players in the paper industry, ends the unwritten taboo on hostile bids, and will push managements to look closely at the industry's several attractive takeover candidates. 

"Consolidation has been long overdue.
It was just the culture of the industry that kept it from happening.
The Georgia-Pacific offer has definitely changed the landscape," said Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer & Co. Added Mark Rogers of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.: "It's much easier to be second." 

A Georgia-Pacific acquisition of Nekoosa would create the largest U.S. forest-products company.
Based on 1988 sales, Georgia-Pacific ranked third at $9.51 billion, behind Weyerhaeuser Co. at $10 billion and International Paper Co. at $9.53 billion.
Nekoosa ranked 11th with sales of $3.59 billion.
The combined company would have had 1988 sales of $13.1 billion. 

But such a combination also presents great risks.
At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive, adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects.
Moreover, any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific because two of Nekoosa's major product lines -- containerboard, which is used to make shipping boxes, and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities. 

"Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be," said Rod Young, vice president of Resource Information Systems Inc., a Bedford, Mass., economic-forecasting firm. "Depending on how far down you go, it may be difficult to pay off that debt." 

One person familiar with Georgia-Pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company's debt of almost $3 billion.
It also could be a drag on Georgia-Pacific earnings because the roughly $1.5 billion in goodwill -- the amount by which the bid exceeds Nekoosa's book value of $1.5 billion -- will have to be subtracted from earnings over a period of decades. 

Georgia-Pacific's Mr. Hahn said that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways.
The two companies each produce market pulp, containerboard and white paper.
That means goods could be manufactured closer to customers, saving shipping costs, he said. 

Moreover, production runs would be longer, cutting inefficiencies from adjusting machinery between production cycles.
And Georgia-Pacific could save money in selling pulp, because the company uses its own sales organization while Nekoosa employs higher-cost agents. 

Mr. Hahn said Georgia-Pacific has accounted in its strategy for a "significant downturn" in the pulp and paper industry, an event that he said would temporarily dilute earnings.
But he said that even under those conditions, the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger. "The fit is so good, we see this as a time of opportunity," he said. 

Georgia-Pacific, which has suspended its stock-repurchase program, would finance the acquisition with all bank debt, provided by banks led by BankAmerica Corp. Georgia-Pacific owns 349,900 Nekoosa shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than $15 million worth.
U.S. clearance also is needed for the proposed acquisition. 

For Nekoosa, defense options may be undercut somewhat by the precarious state of the junk-bond market, which limits how much value the target could reach in a debt-financed recapitalization.
The company's chairman, Mr. Laidig, and a group of advisers met at the offices of Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz, a law firm specializing in takeover defense.
Nekoosa also is being advised by Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

Georgia-Pacific's advisers are Wasserstein, Perella & Co., which stands to receive a $15 million fee if the takeover succeeds, and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling. 

People familiar with Nekoosa said its board isn't likely to meet before the week after next to respond to the bid.
The board has 10 business days to respond. 

In addition to the usual array of defenses, including a so-called poison pill and a staggered board, Nekoosa has another takeover defense: a Maine state law barring hostile bidders from merging acquired businesses for five years.
Nekoosa is incorporated in Maine. 

Georgia-Pacific has filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maine challenging the poison pill and the Maine merger law. 

Nekoosa's poison pill allows shareholders to vote to rescind it, but Georgia-Pacific isn't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take 90 to 120 days, and wouldn't affect the provisions of the Maine law. 

Among companies mentioned by analysts as possible counterbidders for Nekoosa are International Paper, Weyerhaeuser, Canadian Pacific Ltd. and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. "I'm sure everybody else is putting pencil to paper," said Kathryn McAuley, an analyst with First Manhattan Co. 

International Paper and Weyerhaeuser declined to comment.
Canadian Pacific couldn't be reached for comment, and MacMillan Bloedel said it hasn't any plans to make a bid for Nekoosa. 

Investors were quick to spot other potential takeover candidates, all of which have strong cash flows and low-cost operations.
Among paper company stocks that rallied on the Big Board because of the offer were Union Camp, up $2.75 to $37.75, Federal Paperboard, up $1.75 to $27.875, Mead, up $2.375 to $38.75, and Temple Inland Inc., up $3.75 to $62.25.
In over-the-counter national trading, Bowater Inc. jumped $1.50 to $27.50. 

Some analysts argued that there won't be a flurry of takeovers because the industry's continuing capacity-expansion program is eating up available cash.
Moreover, some analysts said they expect a foreign paper company with deeper pockets than Georgia-Pacific to end up acquiring Nekoosa, signaling to the rest of the industry that hostile bids are unproductive. 

"This is a one-time event," said Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber Inc., referring to the Georgia-Pacific bid. 

But many analysts believe that, given the attractiveness of paper companies' cash flows, as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in Europe, there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for U.S. companies within the next several months.
The buyers, these analysts added, could be either foreign or other U.S.concerns. 

"The Georgia-Pacific bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation" in the paper industry, said Mark Devario of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 

"I don't think anyone is now immune from takeover," said Robert Schneider of Duff & Phelps Inc., Chicago.
He added: "Every paper company management has to be saying to itself, `Before someone comes after me, I'm going to go after somebody. '" 

Prudential-Bache's Mr. Rodgers said he doesn't see the industry's capacity-expansion program hindering takeover activity.
Several projects, he said, are still on the drawing board.
Moreover, "it's a lot cheaper and quicker to buy a plant than to build one." 

Indeed, a number of analysts said that Japanese paper companies are hungry to acquire additional manufacturing capacity anywhere in the world.
Some predicted that Nekoosa will end up being owned by a Japanese company. 

Meanwhile, Shearson Lehman's Mr. Devario said that, to stay competitive, the U.S. paper industry needs to catch up with the European industry.
Since the most-recent wave of friendly takeovers was completed in the U.S. in 1986, there have been more than 100 mergers and acquisitions within the European paper industry, he said. 

Price Stern Sloan Inc. said it hired an investment banking firm to assist in evaluating restructuring or merger alternatives and reported a net loss of $8.1 million, or $2.14 a share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 

These results compare with net income of $1.8 million, or 44 cents a share, for the corresponding period last year.
This quarter's loss includes pretax charges of $4.9 million on the proposed discontinuation of the company's troubled British subsidiary, and $3.7 million of other write-offs the company said were non-recurring and principally related to inventory, publishing advances and pre-publication costs.
The publishing concern said it retained the investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc. to act as its financial adviser, assisting in the evaluation of various financial and strategic alternatives, including debt refinancing, raising capital, recapitalization, a merger or sale of the company. 

The company also retained attorney Martin P. Levin, a director of the company and former head of the Times-Mirror Publishing Group, as an adviser. 

Net sales for this year's third quarter were $14 million, down from $21.4 million last year.
The company attributed the decrease in part to the exclusion of the company's British sales from the current year's figures as a result of the subsidiary's status as a proposed discontinued operation and, in part, to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts.
U.K. sales for last year's quarter were about $3 million. 

A governing body of both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board voted to give the FASB jurisdiction over accounting standards for certain government-owned entities. 

The Financial Accounting Foundation voted 12-2 that FASB accounting rules supercede GASB rules in regard to utilities, hospitals, and colleges and universities owned by the government.
GASB rules still apply for other government units. 

After the GASB was founded in 1984, 11 years after the FASB, the government-owned entities were supposed to follow FASB rules unless the GASB superceded them.
The GASB had told governments they didn't have to follow FASB rules on depreciation, making it difficult for bond-rating agencies to compare private and state-owned schools, which compete in the public bond market. 

The foundation vote is effective for the affected government entities with fiscal years that begin starting next Jan. 1 and makes the financial results of the hospitals, colleges and schools easier to compare with for-profit businesses.
But it may lead to separate financial reports based on different rules for the government entities under FASB rules and those still under GASB rules. 

"Managers of government entities are often more concerned with the political and legal structure and financial-report comparability with profit-making businesses isn't always as high a priority," a foundation spokesman said. 

Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter, while Nynex Corp., Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period. 

Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West's third-quarter profit.
Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9%, noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit. 

Revenue dropped 4.3% to $2.3 billion from $2.4 billion, reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector, long-distance carrier business and diversified division.
Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3% to $618.9 million from $599.4 million a year ago. 

New telephone lines posted healthy growth.
Overall they increased 2.8% to 12.1 million, putting U S West over the 12 million mark for the first time.
Business lines increased 3.7% to 3.3 million. 

"On a truly comparable basis, we've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company," said Jack MacAllister, chairman and chief executive officer. "The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years." 

He said the company expects to be "on target" with analysts' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents "a significant challenge." 

Expenses in the quarter dropped 11.2% to $664.3 million from $747.7 million a year ago.
Yesterday, U S West shares rose 75 cents to close at $71.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5%, aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines. 

Revenue jumped 5.6% to $2.9 billion from $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23% to $177.4 million from $144.1 million a year ago.
Network-access revenue from long-distance telephone companies increased 6.4% to $618.6 million. 

Bell Atlantic added 148,000 new telephone lines in the quarter for a total of 16.9 million. 

The company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans. 

In composite trading on the Big Board, Bell Atlantic closed at $100.625, up $1.50 a share. 

At Nynex, net slumped 14.8%, primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees, lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs. 

State and local taxes increased to $131.3 million from $99.1 million a year ago.
Nynex said expenses rose 4.5% to $2.73 billion from $2.61 billion, a $119 million increase.
Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units, it added. 

"Our net income isn't where we would want it to be at this point," said William C. Ferguson, chairman and chief executive officer. "This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone." 

Mr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area's economy and increased competition, particularly in the private-line market, took a heavy toll on earnings. 

The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter.
Nynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter, which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines. 

Revenue rose to $3.31 billion from $3.18 billion, mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses. 

In Big Board composite trading yesterday, Nynex common closed at $81.125, up $1.625. 

Southern New England Telecommunications, which bolstered its marketing efforts for telephone and non-telephone subsidiaries, reported that net increased 8.1%. 

Walter H. Monteith Jr., SNET chairman and chief executive officer, said: "Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue." 

Revenue and sales increased 7.5% to $423.9 million from $394.4 million a year earlier.
Yellow pages advertising sales rose 11.8% to $41.2 million. 

Cost and expenses for the quarter, excluding interest, increased 6.1% to $333.3 million from $314 million the year before. 

SNET common rose $1.25 to $85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board. 

San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6%, primarily because of regulatory action.
Revenue was about flat at $2.4 billion. 

Revenue was reduced $33 million by three extraordinary items: a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment; a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies. 

Excluding the one-time charges, the company would have posted earnings of $298 million, or 73 cents a share.
The company also was hurt by a $289 million rate reduction that went into effect in 1989. 

"This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals," said Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer.
Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5% for a total of about $13.5 million for the quarter; toll calls increased 9.6% to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion. 

In Big Board composite trading yesterday, Pacific Telesis common closed at $45.50, up 87.5 cents. 

a-Includes a one-time gain of $88.7 million from a commonstock sale by U S West's U S West New Vector Group. b-Includes a $41.3 million gain on the sale of FiberCom. 

Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. lost its second recent arbitration case involving a former bond-trading executive. 

A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered Dean Witter to pay $404,294 in back bonuses to William Kelly, the company's former head of high-yield, high-risk junk-bond trading and sales.
It also awarded $196,785 in back bonuses to former trader Michael Newcomb and $69,105 in fees to the two men's attorneys. 

The sums awarded to Messrs.
Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988, but which weren't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract. 

Jeffrey L. Liddle, the two men's attorney at Liddle, O'Connor, Finkelstein & Robinson, said Mr. Kelly began working at Dean Witter in 1987.
Mr. Kelly built the company's high-yield bond group, which has been a minor player in the junk-bond arena. 

Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year; in August it paid $666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief, Harold Bachman.
That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash. 

A spokesman for Dean Witter, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., declined to comment. 

Ashland Oil Inc. said it will take after-tax charges of $78 million, or $1.40 a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 30. 

Because of the charge, Ashland expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and "significantly lower results" for fiscal 1989. 

The oil refiner said it will report fiscal fourth quarter and 1989 results next week. 

The company earned $66 million, or $1.19 a share, on revenue of $2.1 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter.
For fiscal 1988, Ashland had net of $224 million, or $4.01 a share, on revenue of $7.8 billion.
Both revenue figures exclude excise taxes. 

The charges consist of: a $25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in Ashland's Riley Consolidated subsidiary; a previously announced $38 million after-tax charge resulting from a $325 million settlement with National Iranian Oil Co. and a $15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its Ashland Technology Corp. subsidiary.
Ashland expects that sale to be complete next year. 

The charge for the Riley subsidiary is for expected costs to correct problems with certain bed boilers built for utilities.
The charge will be added to $20 million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns. 

For Vietnamese, these are tricky, often treacherous, times.
After years of hesitation, economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986, but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action. 

Vietnam is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market doesn't come easy.
Here is how three Vietnamese are coping with change: 

The Tire King 

Nguyen Van Chan is living proof that old ways die hard. 

Mr. Chan used to be an oddity in Hanoi: a private entrepreneur.
His business success made him an official target in pre-reform days.
Mr. Chan, now 64 years old, invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste.
Later, he marketed glue.
Both products were immensely popular.
For his troubles, Mr. Chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974.
Though his operation was registered and used only scrap, he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials.
Once he was held for three months without being charged. 

Things were supposed to change when Vietnam's economic reforms gathered pace, and for awhile they did.
After years of experimenting, Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival.
By 1982, he was selling thousands of tires.
Newspapers published articles about him, and he was hailed as "the tire king." His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition -- and attracted renewed attention from local authorities. 

District police in 1983 descended on his suburban home, which he and his large family used as both residence and factory, and demanded proof the house and equipment were his.
He produced it. "That was the first time they lost and I won," he says.
He was further questioned to determine if he was "a real working man or an exploiter." Says Mr. Chan: "When I showed it was from my own brain, they lost for the second time." 

But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity, acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property.
Warned he was to be jailed again, he fled to the countryside.
His family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated.
With only the clothes they were wearing, family members moved to a home owned by one of Mr. Chan's sons. 

After six months on the run, Mr. Chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled.
He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice, pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights.
He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles, selling fruit and doing odd jobs. 

Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 -- and became a minor celebrity again -- when his story was published in a weekly newspaper. 

In 1988, 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family-run private enterprise, district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work.
By late last year he was invited back as "the tire king" to display his products at a national exhibition.
National leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements. 

Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son's small house.
Eighteen people pack the house's two rooms -- the Chans, four of their 10 children with spouses, and eight of 22 grandchildren.
Most sleep on the floor. 

Come daybreak, eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street.
The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard, where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water. 

Mr. Chan talks optimistically of expanding, maybe even moving into the import-export field.
First, however, he has unfinished business.
When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing, they released only one of his machines.
They didn't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital.
Nor did they return his house and contents, which he values at about $44,000.
He wants to recover more than just his property, though. 

"I want my dignity back," he says. 

The Editor 

Nguyen Ngoc seemed an obvious choice when the Vietnamese Writers Association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper, Van Nghe. 

After the sixth congress, journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects.
Mr. Ngoc, 57 years old, had solid reformist credentials: He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature.
Appointed editor in chief in July 1987, Mr. Ngoc rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into Vietnam's hottest paper. 

Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover Vietnamese society and its ills.
Readers were electrified by the paper's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered. 

One article recounted a decade-long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove, officially, he was alive.
Another described how tax-collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers.
The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep, a former history teacher, who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association. 

Van Nghe quickly made influential enemies. "Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly" to the restyled paper, says Lai Nguyen An, a literary critic.
After months of internal rumblings, Mr. Ngoc was fired last December.
His dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today. 

"Under Mr. Ngoc, Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government," says Nguyen Duy, a poet who is the paper's bureau chief for southern Vietnam. "The paper reflected the truth.
For the leadership, that was too painful to bear." 

The `Billionaire' 

Nguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam's entrepreneur of the 1980s.
Her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s. 

Mrs. Thi didn't wait for the reforms to get her start.
She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country.
Her success, which included alleviating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s, helped persuade Hanoi to take the reform path.
Her story is becoming part of local folklore. 

A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the French and the U.S.-backed Saigon regime, she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war.
Her instincts were capitalistic, despite her background.
As she rode over regulations, only her friendship with party leaders, including Nguyen Van Linh, then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary, kept her out of jail. 

Following Mr. Linh's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress, Mrs. Thi has become the darling of "doi moi", the Vietnamese version of perestroika.
The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of "the new way of thinking." 

Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam's richest woman. "Some people call me the communist billionaire," she has told visitors. 

Actually, 67-year-old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land.
She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate, but the company itself remains state-owned.
She manages it with the title of general-director. 

The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities, such as corn and coffee, from farmers in the south, paying with fertilizer, farm tools and other items.
Last year, Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice, more than 10% of the country's output. 

The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses.
A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network. 

In recent years, Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company, taking a 20% stake in newly established, partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank, and setting up Saigon Petro, which owns and operates Vietnam's first oil refinery. 

Mrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60% to the equivalent of about $2.7 million on sales of $150 million.
She expects both revenue and profit to gain this year. 

She is almost cavalier about the possibility Vietnam's reforms will create rivals on her home turf. "I don't mind the competition inside the country," she says. "I am only afraid that with Vietnam's poor-quality products we can't compete with neighboring countries." 

What's in a name?
Apparently a lot, according to the British firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells. 

The British firm has begun court proceedings in London to prevent the use of the name "Deloitte" by Deloitte, Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Co. in England and the rest of the world.
The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of Deloitte and Touche world-wide and joined Coopers & Lybrand. 

John Bullock, senior partner of Deloitte in the U.K., said "the decision to start these proceedings hasn't been taken lightly." Mr. Bullock said the British firm has used the name "Deloitte" since 1845.
In the U.S., Deloitte, Haskins & Sells was known as Haskins & Sells until 1978, when it added the "Deloitte" name of its British affiliate. 

John C. Burton, an accounting professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, said "there's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in England, where accounting predates the U.S." Although accountants aren't noted as "being deeply emotional, they really hold it all in," said Mr. Burton, former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

J. Michael Cook, chairman of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells International, said he believes the legal action by the British firm "to be without merit." Mr. Cook said that last June, the international executive committes of Deloitte and Touche agreed to a world-wide merger. "The merger is proceeding according to plan, except as to the withdrawal of the Deloitte U.K. firm," he said. 

Partners at other accounting firms say that the Deloitte firm in the U.K. is filing the suit to get even with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm for keeping major auditing work in England.
General Motors Corp., a Deloitte audit client, for example, has agreed to keep its annual $18 million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm, to be known as Deloitte & Touche in the U.S.
In England, this would mean that the British Deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of GM's Vauxhill unit. 

The defection of Deloitte's affiliates in Britain and the Netherlands to Coopers & Lybrand will make Coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in Europe, rivaling KPMG Peat Marwick there.
Although Coopers hasn't been courted by other major accounting firms for a merger, it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the Deloitte-Touche merger. 

In New York, Harris Amhowitz, general counsel of Coopers, said Coopers "was aware of the litigation," but he declined further comment.
He also declined to comment on the name that Coopers would use in England if Deloitte UK won its litigation to keep its name.
Coopers uses the Coopers & Lybrand name world-wide. 

Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage. 

That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. "Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies," said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. 

It "may well be" that theft of business data is "as serious a strategic threat to national security" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. 

The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. 

Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air.
Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder.
They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait. "You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time," Mr. Matchett said, adding: "It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught." The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information. 

Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said.
By contrast, European firms will spend $150 million this year on electronic security, and are expected to spend $1 billion by 1992.
Already many foreign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers, conference speakers reported.
Still, encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy.
One expert, whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldn't be named or quoted, said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers, for example, doubling as foreign spies. 

Moreover, he said, technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they've been "erased" from a computer's memory.
He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read.
No personal computer, not even the one on a chief executive's desk, is safe, this speaker noted. 

W. Mark Goode, president of Micronyx Inc., a Richardson, Texas, firm that makes computer-security products, provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness, known commonly as glasnost.
Under Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Goode said, the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications.
He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East.
Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company, which hadn't been invited to submit a bid.
The Soviets' eavesdropping paid off, however, because they got the contract. 

The "seismic" activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth.
When things are quiet (low volatility), the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately.
However, when powerful forces start shaking the market's structure, the more "earthquake-resistant" it is, the better its chance for survival. 

America's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully "aftershock-resistant." Investors lack equal access to the markets' trading arena and its information. 

That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity.
And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks.
In today's markets, specialists (on the New York Stock Exchange) and "upstairs" market makers (in the over-the-counter market) are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process.
When they halt trading, all market liquidity is gone.
And when any component of the market -- cash, futures or options -- loses liquidity, the price discovery system (the way prices are determined) becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time. 

Last Friday the 13th (as well as two years ago this week) the markets became unlinked.
When that happened, "seismic" tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market's volatility.
Lack of important, needed information can cause fear.
Fear is the father of panic.
Panic frequently results in irrational behavior.
And in financial markets, irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe. 

When market tremors start, it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve (buy and sell orders at various prices) be made available to all, not just to market makers.
Because of a lack of information and access, many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed, because of their ignorance of important market information.
To add aftershock-damping power to America's markets, a modern, electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena (and the information that would automatically accompany such access) by investors -- particularly institutional investors. 

Contrary to some opinions, the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole.
What market makers provide is immediacy, a very valuable service.
Liquidity is not a service.
It is a market attribute -- the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news. 

Market makers buy what investors wish to sell; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors, and at a profit.
As a result, while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker (which is micro-liquidity for the investor), the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction: The unwanted position is still an unwanted position; only the identity of the seller has changed.
In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers (a result of some post-1987 crash studies) also increases market volatility, since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time, the more selling pressure is overhanging the market. 

In an open electronic system, any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve (buy and sell orders at each price) entered by dealers and investors alike, and to enter and execute orders.
Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis. 

Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a "national market system" (not yet achieved) almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975. 

Last Friday's market gyrations did not result in severe "aftershocks." Were we smart or just lucky?
I'm not certain.
But I am sure we need to maximize our "earthquake" protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation's markets. 

Mr. Peake is chairman of his own consulting company in Englewood, N.J. 

Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's most recent spate of financial troubles, the institution's executive chairman, Mohamed Basir Ismail, said. 

Speaking to reporters this week after Bank Bumiputra's shareholders approved a rescue plan, Tan Sri Basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in Malaysia plummeted in 1984-85. 

He said the bank couldn't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans.
So the bank's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars (US$457 million) in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank, and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank's paid-up capital. 

The predicament, he added, was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse, which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia's history.
The subsidiary, Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd., was left with M$2.26 billion in bad loans made to Hong Kong property speculators. 

Both episodes wiped out Bank Bumiputra's shareholders' funds.
Each time, the bank's 90% shareholder -- Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, the national oil company -- has been called upon to rescue the institution.
In five years, Petronas, which became the dominant shareholder in a 1984 rescue exercise, has spent about M$3.5 billion to prop up the troubled bank. 

Tan Sri Basir said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia's Capital Issues Committee and central bank.
Malaysia's High Court is expected to approve the plan. 

Once the plan is approved, Tan Sri Basir said, most of Bank Bumiputra's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$160 million and M$170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31.
For the previous financial year, the bank would have reported a pretax profit of M$168 million if it hadn't made provisions for the nonperforming loans, he said. 

Malaysia's Banking Secrecy Act prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers, said Tan Sri Basir.
But public documents indicate 10% or more of the bank's provisions were made for foregone interest on a M$200 million loan to Malaysia's dominant political party, the United Malays National Organization, to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur.
The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983. 

"We lent a lot of money all over the place," said Tan Sri Basir, who refused to discuss the bank's outstanding loans to 

As well as the M$1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6, the restructuring package covers an additional M$450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank's paid-up capital.
At the end of the exercise, the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank's paid-up capital to M$1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions. 

Consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0.2% in September, pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs, the Labor Department reported. 

Energy costs, which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month, continued to decline at the retail level, pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs. 

The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news, closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20.
Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall. 

But many economists were not nearly as jubilant.
The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months, they warned.
They also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods. 

"I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall," said Joel Popkin, a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here. "It has been in what I would describe as a lull for the past several months." 

"We've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months, and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now," said Jay Woodworth, chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York. 

Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6.5% last month, many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too.
As a result, many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did. 

But retail energy prices declined 0.9% in September.
Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices, many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year. 

Still, some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind. "It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem," argued Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. 

In both 1987 and 1988, consumer prices rose 4.4%.
A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7% annual rate in the first five months of this year, but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4%. 

Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices. "The bottom line is, it seems to me that the economic environment has become very, very competitve for a lot of businesses," he said. "Back in 1987-88, business was operating at fairly tight capacity, so businesses felt they could raise prices." Now, he said, a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand. 

The mild inflation figures renewed investors' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance.
The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market's 6.9% plunge that day.
In the past several days, however, the U.S.'s central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets.
Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy. 

Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food -- leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate -- consumer prices still rose only 0.2% in September.
Transportation costs actually fell 0.5%, and housing costs gained only 0.1%.
Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7%, but that was after three months of declines.
Medical costs continued their steep ascent, rising 0.8% after four consecutive months of 0.7% increases. 

Car prices, another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month, still showed declines at the consumer level.
They dropped 0.4% as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers. 

Food prices rose 0.2% for the second month in a row, far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year. 

Separately, the Labor Department reported that average weekly earnings rose 0.3% in September, after adjusting for inflation, following a 0.7% decline in August. 

All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations. 

Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for September. 

September consumer price indexes (1982-1984 equals 100), unadjusted for seasonal variation, together with the percentage increases from September 1988, were: 

China's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall. 

In a report on China's foundering economy, the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9% from a year earlier-the lowest growth rate in a decade for September.
Retail sales are plummeting, while consumer prices still are rising. 

Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation: low growth and high inflation. "The economy is crashing hard," says an Asian economist in Beijing. "The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected." 

A lengthy recession, if it materializes, would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers.
Experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth, rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit.
Unless the government suddenly reverses course, wages for most workers won't keep pace with inflation, creating a potential source of urban unrest. 

The economy's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation. (Industrial output surged 21% in 1988, while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30%.) The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week. 

In Western, market-driven countries, recessions often have a bright side: prodding the economy to greater efficiency.
In China, however, there isn't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state. 

Instead, China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises, which ate up $18 billion in bailouts last year.
Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt.
Rather, the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private "township" enterprises, which have fallen into disfavor as China's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership. 

"When the going gets rough, China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent," says a Western economist. 

Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks.
The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years.
But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing, some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy. 

Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls, particularly by loosening credit.
That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures, both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital.
A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens, if unchecked, to bring the economy to a collapse. 

One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People's Bank of China, the central bank, to allocate $5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest, the official China Daily reported. 

But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries, it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation.
The cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979.
And, because China's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy, it is likely to continue, analysts say. 

The statistical bureau's report, cited in China Daily, notes that industrial output in September totaled $29.4 billion, a rise of just 0.9% from a year earlier.
Output declined in several provinces, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, two key coastal areas, and Sichuan, the nation's agricultural breadbasket.
Production in Shanghai, China's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government, fell 1.8% for the month. 

Nationwide, output of light industrial products declined 1.8% -- "the first decline in 10 years," a bureau spokesman told China Daily. 

In an unusually direct statement, the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers' goods. "This will prevent a slide in industrial production, which will otherwise cause new panic buyings," the spokesman said. 

For retailers, Christmas, not Halloween, promises to be this year's spookiest season. 

Many retailers fear a price war will erupt if cash-strapped companies such as Campeau Corp. slash tags to spur sales.
Concerns about the stock market, doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators. 

"Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer," asserts Norman Abramson, president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc., an off-price chain. 

Even if there isn't any widespread discounting, the outlook for industry profits isn't good.
Management Horizons forecasts a 1.4% profit decline for non-auto retailers this year, after annual drops that averaged 4.5% in 1988 and 1987. "For the last two and a half years, retailing has been in a mild recession," says Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at the Columbus, Ohio, consulting firm. 

This year, many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil: Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code; B.A.T Industries PLC's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's chains are on the auction block; Campeau's Bloomingdale's is also on the block. 

Industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance.
Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly, and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc., May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc., which should do well. 

"There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers," says Cynthia Turk, a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant. 

Says Mr. Steidtmann: "I'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas." 

Economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise 4.5% to 6% from year-ago figures.
But Mr. Steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25% to 30%.
Troubled chains could see their sales drop as much as 8%, he believes, as managers distracted by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy.
Thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales. 

Catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year, particularly in December.
More than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low-cost Federal Express service that guarantees pre-Christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date. 

"Traditionally, consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they didn't believe they would get it by Christmas," says Adam Strum, chairman of the Wine Enthusiast Inc., which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail.
Using Federal Express delivery last year, Mr. Strum says, "December was our biggest month." 

Even Sears, Roebuck & Co. is getting into the act, offering for the first time to have Federal Express deliver toys ordered by Dec. 20 from its Wish Book catalog. 

K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini summed up his outlook for the Christmas season as "not troublesome." He's not predicting a blockbuster, but he is "more optimistic than three months ago" because employment remains strong and inflation low. 

Other retailers are also preparing for a ho-hum holiday.
Philip M. Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest 3% to 5% over last year's totals, both for his company and the industry in general. "I'm not looking for a runaway Christmas at all," he says. 

"It isn't a real boom holiday season in our eyes," says Woolworth Corp. Chairman Harold E. Sells, "but it isn't going to be a bust either." Mr. Sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company -- which besides Woolworth stores includes Kinney and Foot Locker shoe stores and other specialty chains -- to rise "pretty much in line" with its year-to-date increases of between 8% and 9%.
The estimate includes the results of new stores. 

A consumer poll conducted in early September by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market researcher based in Chicago, also suggests a modest holiday.
Of the 450 survey respondents, 35% said they expect to spend less buying Christmas gifts this year than last year, while 28% said they expect to spend more and 37% said their gift budget would stay the same.
The results are almost identical to Shapiro's September 1988 numbers. 

Retailers could get a boost this year from the calendar.
Christmas falls on a Monday, creating a big last-minute weekend opportunity for stores.
Most will stay open late Saturday night and open their doors again Sunday. 

But many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until the last minute. "What you'll hear as we get into December is that sales are sluggish," predicts Woolworth's Mr. Sells. "The week ending the 24th is going to save the entire month for everyone." 

The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers. 

But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away, for the moment, with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver $7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. 

For more than a decade, banks have been pressing Congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing Wall Street's lucrative takeover game, from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds. 

Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice, an equity investment and bank loans for the $3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. 

One of the major selling points used by Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal didn't include any junk bonds.
That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover.
All $3.35 billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks. 

Charles Nathan, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc., says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs.
But the UAL collapse, he says, "may tell you it's not going to work that easily." 

David Batchelder, a mergers adviser in La Jolla, Calif., who aided Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis on the bids which put both UAL and NWA in play as takeover candidates this year, says that banks have been "preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing." 

Mr. Batchelder says that in the past, banks would normally have loaned 65% of a total buy-out price, with the loans secured by the target company's assets.
Another 20% of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds, which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans.
Mr. Checchi's purchase of NWA, Mr. Batchelder notes, "was probably the most aggressive to date," with bank debt at 85% of the purchase price. 

But Mr. Batchelder says that Citicorp's "failure to deliver" on its promise to raise the UAL bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group "is very distressing to potential users of a `highly-confident' letter from commercial banks." His client, Mr. Davis, used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL; Citicorp later agreed to work with a competing UAL buy-out group. 

Executives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation, or on the changing nature of banks' role in financing takeovers. 

In the wake of Campeau's problems, prices of junk bonds tumbled, throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales. 

Mark Solow, senior managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., says the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers.
But he warns that banks will have "to have enough discipline" not to make loans that are too risky. 

In fact, Manufacturers Hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48%, to $21 million. "We didn't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor," says a bank spokesman. 

James B. Lee, head of syndications and private placements at Chemical Banking Corp., said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance.
As evidence, he cites yesterday's arrangement for the final financing of a $3 billion bid for American Medical International Inc. in which Chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor. 

Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market, banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers.
Arthur Fleischer Jr., a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, notes that "a political and emotional bias" has developed against junk bonds. 

One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for $10.7 billion, or $175 a share.
A Paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial, not political, drawbacks of junk bonds. 

But some observers believe Paramount Chairman Martin Davis wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time.
In the end, Mr. Davis used junk bonds so that he could raise Paramount's bid to $200 a share.
Some Monday-morning quarterbacks said the initial lower bid, without junk bonds, was a factor in his losing the company.
Time eluded Paramount by acquiring Warner Communications Inc. 

The success of the NWA financing, and the failure of the UAL deal, also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks. 

Japanese banks accounted for 50% of the NWA bank debt, according to a report by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
But it was broad-scale rejection by Japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy UAL. Citicorp and Chase are attempting to put together a new, lower bid. 

Takanori Mizuno, chief economist of the Institute for Financial Affairs Inc., a Tokyo research center on finance and economics, says, "The junk bond market became very jittery, and there's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO companies.
These factors have combined to deter LBO lending by Japanese banks." provided solely by banks, not high-yield junk bonds 

Your Oct. 12 editorial "Pitiful, Helpless Presidency?" correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3. 

You are absolutely wrong, however, in opining that this position is some kind of "flip-flop," something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls.
My position is one founded on both the facts and the law. 

Although you may have forgotten, public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling (and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative).
The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8, 9, 10 and 11, 1988, and again on April 4, 1988.
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega's criminality, and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies. 

Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him, and to exploit the administration's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing.
As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee, the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics, but made a decision in the summer of 1986 "to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled." 

As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded, "Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war.
This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war." 

Unfortunately, this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega's indictment.
Throughout 1988 and this year, I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this "narcokleptocrat" out of Panama.
Regrettably, two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan, military or economic, for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy.

Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a $75 million stock-for-debt exchange. 

The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal. 

As part of a restructuring announced earlier this year, the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each $1,000 face value of debt.
However, that figure could be revised, Financial Corp. said.
Currently, the company has about six million common shares outstanding.
If all the debt was converted, about 13 million new shares would be issued. 

In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Financial Corp. closed at $1.125, unchanged. 

The debt consists of $50 million of 13 3/8% subordinated notes due 1998, and $25 million of 9% convertible subordinated debentures due 2012. 

Financial Corp. also is proposing to exchange each of its 130,000 outstanding shares of cumulative convertible preferred series A stock for two shares of common. 

Inland Steel Industries Inc., battered by lower volume and higher costs, posted a 75% drop in third-quarter earnings. 

The nation's fourth-largest steelmaker earned $18.3 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $61 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier, when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing.
Sales fell to $981.2 million from $1.02 billion. 

The earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter's $45.3 million or $1.25 a share.
Moreover, the earnings were well below analysts' expectations of about $1.16 a share. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inland closed yesterday at $35.875 a share, down $1. 

The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market, especially in the automotive sector.
However, the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter.
Third-quarter shipments slipped 7% from the year-ago period, and 17% from this year's second quarter. 

Profit of steel shipped for the company's steel segment slid to $26 a ton, from $66 a ton a year earlier and $57 a ton a quarter earlier. 

Analysts noted that the disappointing results don't reflect lower prices for steel products.
Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar, hot-rolled and structural steel.
Structural steel, which primarily serves the construction market, was especially hurt by a 15% price drop, Mr. Bradford said. 

The company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material, repair and maintenance, and labor costs.
The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union.
Meanwhile, the company's service center segment, which saw operating profit drop to $11.5 million from $30.7 million a year ago, experienced much of the same demand and cost problems, as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system. 

Inland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company's short-term outlook is "clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets." However, he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels, and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter. 

In the first nine months, profit was $113 million, or $3.04 a share, on sales of $3.19 billion, compared with $204.5 million, or $5.76 a share, on sales of $3.03 billion, a year earlier. 

Heidi Ehman might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young Republicans.
White, 24 years old, a singer in her church choir, she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan. "I felt kind of safe," she says. 

No longer.
When the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion, Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics.
Then a political novice, she stepped into a whirl of "pro-choice" marches, house parties and fund-raisers.
Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio. 

"This is one where I cross party lines," she says, rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio's opponent, Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter. "People my age thought it wasn't going to be an issue.
Now it has -- especially for people my age." 

Polls bear out this warning, but after a decade of increased Republican influence here, the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter.
Unless he closes the gap, Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month.
Going into the 1990s, the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past. 

This change comes less from a shift in public opinion, which hasn't changed much on abortion over the past decade, than in the boundaries of the debate.
New Jersey's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Webster vs.
Missouri, has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue. 

Before July, pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion.
Now, the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension, bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces.
A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands, and in a major reversal, Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest. 

"If Webster hadn't happened, you wouldn't be here," Linda Bowker tells a reporter in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women. "We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter . . . and no one would have heard us." 

New Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women's-rights movement this year.
The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures.
In Cherry Hill, the National Abortion Rights Action League, whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters, targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause.
The league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders; "I wish I could go work out," says a slim activist.
A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to "man and woman" Election Day phones. 

No age group is more sensitive than younger voters, like Ms. Ehman.
A year ago this fall, New Jersey voters under 30 favored George Bush by 56% to 39% over Michael Dukakis, according to a survey then by Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute.
A matching Eagleton-Newark Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal.
Voters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55% to 29% over Republican Courter. 

Abortion alone can't explain this shift, but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate.
By a 2-to-1 ratio, voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio's stance on abortion, and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue. 

"The times are my times," says Mr. Florio.
The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark "I'm-coming-down-your-throat" intensity, but at a pause in Newark's Columbus Day parade recently, he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city's old Italian-American ward.
After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor's race, he has prepared himself methodically for this moment, including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions. 

"If you're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right," he asks, "how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not?" 

Mr. Courter, by comparison, seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago.
Looking back, he says he erred by stating his "personal" opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he wouldn't impose his views on "policy" as governor.
It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate. 

"He doesn't know himself," Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says of Mr. Courter's position.
Even abortion opponents, however angry with Mr. Florio, can't hide their frustration with the Republican's ambivalence. "He doesn't want to lead the people," says Richard Traynor, president of New Jersey Right to Life. 

Moreover, by stepping outside the state's pro-choice tradition, Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment.
He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate; and by wavering on this issue and abortion, he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides. 

Elected to Congress in 1978, the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan.
Like many of his colleagues, he didn't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors. 

Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences, and Mr. Courter's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor, Thomas Kean, in the 1981 Republican primary here. 

The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter's fortunes, but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate, pro-choice Gov. Kean.
While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government, anti-tax agenda in Washington, Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey's budget in his eight years in office. 

Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter, but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government.
Mr. Courter's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean's own insurance commissioner.
Mr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers. 

Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps, Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head.
He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park.
Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government, he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office. "I don't think we do now," he says. "I think we did." 

Asked the same question after his appearance, Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today.
When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization's 20th anniversary, he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden. 

Details and Camden are essential Florio.
Elected to Congress as a "Watergate baby" in 1974, he ran for governor three years later.
In the opinion of many, he hasn't stopped running since, even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985.
His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge.
With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market, Mr. Florio's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage. 

More than ever, his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state.
Auto insurance rates are soaring.
A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer.
In Monmouth, an important swing area, Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county "clean and green." 

Mr. Florio savors this vindication, but at age 52, the congressman is also a product of his times and losses.
He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21; to increase state revenue he focuses not on "taxes" but on "audits" to cut waste.
Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter's team, and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean, mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s.
Appealing to a young audience, he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead.
The lyric chosen -- "long strange night" -- may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar. 

The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines, but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county's past corruption.
His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state, and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment, he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater, Trenton State College. 

Mr. Florio's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency.
Pasquale Pignatelli, an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band, speaks sadly of Mr. Florio. "I am a devout Catholic," says Mr. Pignatelli, a 40-year-old health officer. "I can't support him because of abortion." 

Bill Wames Sr., 72, is Catholic too, but unfazed by Mr. Florio's stand on abortion.
A security guard at a cargo terminal, he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating "The US 1 Band." "I still think the woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases," he says. "If you want more opinions ask my wife.
She has lots of opinions." 

Hit by higher costs and lower sales, Caterpillar Inc. said third-quarter earnings tumbled 43% and full-year earnings will trail last year's results. 

The construction equipment maker said third-quarter profit fell to $108 million, or $1.07 a share, from $190 million, or $1.87 a share, a year earlier.
Sales dropped 6% to $2.58 billion from $2.74 billion, reflecting eight fewer business days in the latest quarter. 

The company, which is in a costly modernization program, said earnings were hurt by higher start-up and new program costs, increased costs of materials, higher wages and an $11 million provision for bad debts in Latin America. 

In announcing a 1989 capital spending plan of $950 million early this year, Caterpillar said full-year earnings would be flat compared with last year's $616 million, or $6.07 a share.
But yesterday, the company said this year's profit will be lower.
It didn't say by how much. 

Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines, Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria area and temporarily shut its plant in York, Pa., for two weeks in both November and December. 

For the first nine months of the year, Caterpillar said earnings fell 14% to $390 million, or $3.85 a share, from $453 million, or $4.46 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose to $8.19 billion from $7.65 billion. 

Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month, this time 4.2%, while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest. 

The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September.
Amex short interest climbed 3% to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares. 

For the year-earlier month, the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares, indicating a 13.5% year-to-year rise, while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares, a 48% leap. 

Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December, with increases in each month since then except at mid-July. 

Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender. 

Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet been purchased for return to lenders.
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back. 

Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging.
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock. 

The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month's 3.38.
The ratio is the number of trading days, at the exchange's average trading volume, that would be required to convert the total short interest position. 

Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions. 

Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares.
Varity has proposed to acquire K-H Corp., consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of Fruehauf Corp., for $577.3 million of cash and securities. 

Chemical Waste Management posted the biggest increase in short volume on the New York exchange, up 3,383,477 shares to 5,267,238.
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., the entity formed from the recent acquisition of Squibb Corp. by Bristol-Myers Co., logged the largest volume decline, 7,592,988 shares, to 12,017,724. 

Short interest in International Business Machines Corp. plunged to 1,425,035 shares from 2,387,226 shares a month earlier.
Also closely watched is Exxon Corp., where short interest slid to 4,469,167 shares from 5,088,774. 

On a percentage basis, Germany Fund Inc. led the gainers, leaping to 67,972 shares from three shares. 

TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. led the percentage decliners, dropping to 59 shares from 183,467. 

The Amex short interest volume leader again was Texas Air Corp., rising to 3,820,634 shares from 3,363,949.
Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. posted the largest volume increase, 552,302 shares, to 2,157,656.
The company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drugs.
Bolar has denied any wrongdoing. 

The largest volume drop -- down 445,645 shares to 141,903 -- came in shares represented by B.A.T Industries PLC's American depositary receipts.
The company is facing a takeover proposal from the financier Sir James Goldsmith. 

First Iberian Fund led the percentage increases, rising to 73,100 shares from 184.
Nelson Holdings International Ltd. dropped the most on a percentage basis, to 1,000 shares from 255,923. 

The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September. 

Your Oct. 5 editorial "A Democratic Tax Cut" contained an error.
In the third paragraph it referred to the senators seeking loophole suggestions from lobbyists for various sectors of the economy.

Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors, fighting the urge to spend more, we're reminded of those late-night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says, "Stop me before I kill again." The Members know they're doing wrong, but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions. 

Arkansas Democrat David Pryor spilled his guts on the Senate floor the other day after he'd joined the Finance Committee's early-morning pork-barrel revels: "I must tell you . . . I come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter.
It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy." He was turning himself in. 

"Frankly, as I was walking back to get in my car, I heard many, many people . . . opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in," he said. "As I was driving home, I did not feel very good about myself." 

We can applaud Mr. Pryor's moment of epiphany, even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again.
A good place to start the rehabilitation is a "legislative line-item veto" bill now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats.
The Coats bill, which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors, isn't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills.
Instead it's a form of "enhanced rescission," giving a President a chance to rescind, or strike, specific spending items that just go too far. 

Under the proposal, a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of "rescissions" to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes.
Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50% majority, but then a President could veto that rejection.
Congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to override any veto. 

The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 Budget "Reform" Act.
Before 1974, a President could "impound," or refuse to spend, funds appropriated by Congress.
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power, but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away. 

Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind.
This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens, and naturally rescissions are almost never approved.
In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3% of the spending total was approved by Congress.
Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts.
The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police (in the form of a President) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now. 

Mr. Coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month.
President Bush has endorsed the idea, and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past.
We're told Senator Pryor isn't yet a co-sponsor, but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions, they'll sign up. 

THE PANHANDLER approaches, makes his pitch.
It may be straightforward -- he wants money for food -- or incredibly convoluted; his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken, he has lost his wallet and has only $1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing $3.83, and won't you give him the difference?
No?
Well, how about a loan, he'll take your name and address . . . 

Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express, most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this.
But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer, famine, child abuse, or what have you.
Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals.
But will it? 

In a distressing number of cases, no.
In fact, the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler: at least he has no overhead, and he might even be telling the truth. 

Last year, more than $100 billion was donated to the nation's 400,000 charities.
While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for, it's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in "expenses" claimed by other operators, including fraudulent expenses.
In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries. 

It's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs, high-living operators, and downright fraud.
But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent.
State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams, and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging. 

The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year, measuring them against minimum standards for accountability; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established.
The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program.
Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test. 

Which, it should be added, doesn't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway.
Without a microscope and a subpoena, it's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you've got to go on is the solicitation itself.
On this basis, "there's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one," says David Ormstedt, an assistant attorney general in Connecticut. "A lot of donors just get taken." 

Including those, he contends, who put about $1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center.
The state has sued these charities in state court, complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent; 82%, says Mr. Ormstedt, went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats, trips to Florida, Lucullan restaurant tabs.
The telephone number for the charity in Shelton, Conn., has been disconnected, and the former officials couldn't be located. 

Running a charity does cost money, but reputable organizations manage to get the lion's share of donations out to where they are really needed.
The Arthritis Foundation, the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90% of their income on programs, not overhead.
With some other charities, however, its the other way around. 

The fledgling National Children's Cancer Society, for example, took in $2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children.
By the time it paid its expenses it only had $120,000 left -- not enough to treat even one child.
The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago, along with Telesystems Marketing Inc., its Houston-based fund raiser. 

Both deny wrongdoing.
The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising, but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come.
Michael Burns, president of Telesystems, says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case, noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children's.
Meanwhile, a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds. 

Enforcers can't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion's share of their income on fund raising.
State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead, but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.
It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising, which would amount to limiting the charities' first-amendment right to freedom of expression. 

This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation, and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently.
The attorney general's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years, and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere. 

In making cases, the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities' fund raisers.
Illinois, for instance, currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there. 

Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give.
Attorneys general in several states, including Illinois, are already suing Watson & Hughey Co., an Alexandria, Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America. 

According to the Illinois attorney general's suit, Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes, and could win up to an additional $1,000 on top of them, if they contributed as little as $7.
But the total value of the prizes was only $5,000 and most "winners" will receive just 10 cents, according to the attorney general's office.
The suit is still pending in Illinois state court.
Watson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court; officials decline to comment further. 

While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants, enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface.
There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators, they say, that it is probably impossible to stop them all. 

One maneuver: the "public education" gambit.
The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue.
What it doesn't say is that the entire "campaign" may be the fund-raising letter itself. 

"All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as, `Don't smoke!' or `Wear suntan lotion, ' " says William Webster, attorney general of Missouri. "By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations, hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters." 

Mr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win $5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as $5 to cancer education. "A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that's only two inches in all four pages.
I think some people may believe they're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign, but we couldn't find that the charity does anything except write these letters," he says.
Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity didn't return repeated phone calls. 

Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest, best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs.
The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it. "We can't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name.
Most of them don't last for long, but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they aren't connected with us," says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association.
And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and doesn't even know it.
A couple in Rockford, Ill., raised $12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, without permission from the group.
MADD didn't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $613, along with a letter saying that was the charity's "share." 

The Illinois Attorney General won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without MADD's permission.
The couple couldn't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford, law enforcement officials report.
Denise McDonald, a spokeswoman for MADD, says, "It's scary, because anybody could do this."f

First they get us to buy computers so we can get more information.
Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read.
Now they plan to sell us products that sift through all the information to give us what we really want to know. 

The products range from computer-edited, personal newsletters to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires. 

"Filtered news is what people want," says Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter that spots new developments. "Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what they really need." 

Geoffrey Goodfellow, who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm, says: "Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they don't have time to wade through the muck." Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park, Calif., company called Anterior Technology that provides human editors for public electronic networks. "I see it as a sewage treatment plant," he says. 

A new product, NewsEdge, carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user.
The product, developed by Desktop Data Corp., a new company based in Waltham, Mass., scans the wires looking for articles that contain key words specified by the user. 

One early user, David Semmel, a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data, says he uses it to track takeover developments.
He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover, acquisition, acquire, LBO, tender, merger, junk and halted. "I'm pretty confident I'm catching everything," he says. 

NewsEdge is pricey: $7,500 a year for a limited version, $40,000 a year if the cost of all the news wires is included.
And it works best in high-powered personal computers.
But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic.
Jeffrey Tarter, editor of SoftLetter, a Watertown, Mass., industry newsletter, says: "I've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information.
This is the first time I've seen something I could imagine a lot of people using." 

NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters, McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co., as well as PR Newswire, which carries corporate press releases.
An FM receiver attached to a user's personal computer receives the information. 

Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in.
George Goodwin, an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada, adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called Agenda to sort through international news wires.
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas. 

For those who don't need their personalized information moment by moment, some services are offering overnight newsletters. 

Individual Inc., a new company in Brookline, Mass., uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton, to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day. 

"We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge," says Yosi Amram, founder and president.
The daily newsletter, which isn't widely available yet, will have a base cost of $2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters, McGraw Hill, United Press International, two press release news wires and Japan's Kyodo news service. 

One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm. "They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition," Mr. Amram says.
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC's distributors and customers. 

Individual Inc. 's technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus.
If a customer asks for stories about "IBM," the computer will also supply stories that mention "I.B.M., International Business Machines, or Big Blue," Mr. Amram says. 

Moreover, Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber's interest area.
It compares the position of key words in the story; words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value.
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base.
The higher the ratio of hits to total words, the higher the presumed value to the reader. 

Pinpoint Information Corp., Chantilly, Va., a producer of $1,800-a-year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that started full operation last month, relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber. "The computers find all the key words they can, but the editors confirm every one.
Computer picking isn't perfect," says Harvey Golomb, president and founder of Pinpoint.
The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications. 

Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base, Pinpoint's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three-to-five-page newsletter format; each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber's fax machine.
Mr. Golomb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters a night. 

Many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically.
So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos, gossip, technical data, schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks. 

"All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what's junk and what's important," says Chuck Digate, a former Lotus Development executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem.
Mr. Digate says his firm, Beyond Inc., has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use. 

The MIT project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days.
Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product "so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again next week." And if a user is busy, "he can set it for crisis mode: `Don't bother me with reports until Monday. '" 

A program called Notes, which is under development by Lotus, also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups.
One thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same.
Notes, which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics, allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail.
A daily news briefing from the company librarian, for example, would have a distinctive format on the screen, just as a paper version would have. 

"With E-mail, you don't have the visual clues of paper," says Mr. Tarter, the editor of SoftLetter. "With Notes, they're visually distinct." 

The government will try to sell all the real estate managed by the Federal Asset Disposition Association in one fell swoop, said William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 

The FADA real-estate package, with an asking price of $428 million, is comprised of 150 properties in Texas, California, Colorado, Arizona and Florida.
It includes apartments, shopping centers, office buildings and undeveloped land. 

Mr. Seidman is chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., established to sell or merge the nation's hundreds of insolvent savings-and-loan associations.
The RTC, created by this year's S&L bailout legislation, is trying to sell FADA's network of offices separately.
FADA, which holds problem assets of thrifts that were closed before the bailout legislation was enacted, is being liquidated. 

The properties held by FADA won't be sold piecemeal, Mr. Seidman said in a speech before Southern Methodist University Business School in Dallas. "You need to buy the entire lot," Mr. Seidman said, "so get out your checkbooks." 

A House-Senate conference approved a nearly $17 billion State, Justice and Commerce Department bill that makes federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1. 

The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then, but beginning in fiscal 1991, the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $500 million until the total liability of approximately $1.25 billion is paid.
The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments, but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988. 

The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor, Education, Health and Human Services.
Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate, which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women. 

Reversing an eight-year federal policy, the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest, but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother's life is in danger.
Mr. Bush's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House, but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill. 

The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State, Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990.
An estimated $1.32 billion is provided for next year's census, and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens. 

Elsewhere in the Commerce Department, nearly $191.2 million is preserved for assistance programs under the Economic Development Administration.
And in a footnote to the fall of House Speaker James Wright this year, the conference voted to rescind $11.8 million in unspent EDA funds for a Fort Worth, Texas, stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader. 

Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies, and an 18% increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget would be financed entirely by an added $26 million in filing fees.
In an unprecedented step, the measure anticipates another $30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances. 

The bill doesn't include an estimated $1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House.
But yesterday's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50% increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants. 

Similarly, the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $1.6 million each in drug grants, or three times the current minimum. 

The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures, and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency.
Lawmakers scrapped all of a $7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville, Spain, but agreed elsewhere to $15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger. 

Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department, attached $10 million for an advanced technology initiative, including work on high-definition television.
His Republican counterpart, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the Legal Services Corp. 

An estimated $321 million is provided to maintain the program, but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed.
The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year, and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the Food Research and Action Center. 

The bill also provides $620.5 million to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and $80 million for peace-keeping activities.
Both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989, although the amount for peace-keeping shows a 27% cut from the administration's request. 

Tuesday's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that, at least at the federal level, political "ticket splitting" has been on the rise over the past half century.
In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.
Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40%. 

As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress.
In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.
Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly the opposite. 

What accounts for the results of recent decades?
A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth.
The theory relies on three assumptions: 

1) Voters can "buy" one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action, and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest. 

2) Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues (programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large) and attending to local issues (constituency service and pork barrel). 

3) Republican congressional representatives, because of their belief in a minimalist state, are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress. 

If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Democratic.
If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies.
Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making. 

In races for the White House, a voter's incentive, at the margin, is to lean Republican.
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits.
The individual voter's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes. 

While this theory is exceedingly simple, it appears to explain several things.
First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe. 

Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives: Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency. 

Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office.
For example, first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually immune to defeat.
The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982.
Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making, they were more vulnerable to defeat. 

Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office.
Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent.
To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their disadvantage, the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates. 

Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South.
To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office. 

Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.
Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts. 

Is there any empirical support for this theory?
Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues.
First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.
To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns. 

Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.
This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House.
The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959. 

Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices.
An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body changed party hands), moreover, reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table cannot be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise, due to their majority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff. 

An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden is per state (a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder).
Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe. 

Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level.
State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse.
A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate. 

In sum, at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation.

Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution. 

Until now, BNL's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree.
But under the bank's proposed statutes, an assembly of shareholders must approve board members.
The bank's chairman and director general, who also sit on the board, still would be appointed by the Treasury. 

BNL, which is controlled by the Italian Treasury, was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq.
The ensuing scandal, in which the bank's management resigned, has helped renew calls for privatization, or at least an overhaul, of Italy's banking system, which is about 80% state-controlled. 

In a related move, the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank's new shareholding structure.
BNL called a shareholders' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals. 

BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange.
The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal; Consob, the stock exchange regulatory body, reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension. 

Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to its board, increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11. 

Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11% stake, and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board. 

Separately, Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2% to $65.2 million, or 57 cents a share, from $63.9 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period.
Sales rose 9% to $921.6 million from $845.7 million, with sales of the company's international/diversified operations "well above" the year earlier-period. 

For the nine months, Gillette's net income declined 1% to $205.3 million, or $2.02 a share, from $207 million, or $1.82 a share, in the 1988 period.
Sales rose 6% to $2.77 billion from $2.61 billion. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company closed yesterday at $45.50 a share, up 25 cents. 

The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week, industry executives say. 

Although such a venture wouldn't match the "fourth network" created by News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co., MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions.
Fox, which also owns six TV stations, provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates. 

Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV formed a joint venture last month, named Premier Advertiser Sales, to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies, such as "Star Trek: the Next Generation," "Charles in Charge" and "Friday the 13th: the Series." 

A spokeswoman for Paramount said the company doesn't comment on speculation.
Calls to Shelly Schwab, president of MCA TV, weren't returned. 

The two companies, like Fox, already have their own TV stations.
MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79% stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at $140 million.
TVX owns five stations, including WTXF, a Fox affiliate, in Philadelphia. 

One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities.
Currently, Fox supplies programs on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, although the company plans to expand to other weeknights. 

Jamie Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting, said, "We believe the partnership of Fox, its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow." 

Another Fox official, who declined to be identified, said Fox wasn't pleased by the possible Paramount-MCA venture into prime-time programming. "To make the venture work, they would need Fox affiliates," he said. "We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations," he said, adding that Fox doesn't "appreciate" another company attempting to usurp its station lineup. 

Fox said it plans to offer its stations movies, theatrical and made-for-TV ventures, probably on Wednesdays, sometime next year.
It is also planning another night of original series. 

Paramount and MCA, according to the broadcasting executive, plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays. 

The executive said Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries' broadcasting unit, which owns five independent stations in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland, Ore.
A Chris-Craft station manager said there have been no formal talks. 

"I think it's to Fox's advantage to be associated with the Paramount-MCA venture," said Michael Conway, station manager of WTXF, the TVX station that is a Fox affiliate.
Mr. Conway said the Fox shows appearing on nights when Paramount-MCA shows wouldn't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by Paramount-MCA. 

Michael Fisher, general manager of KTXL, a Fox affiliate in Sacramento, Calif., said, "The real question is whether the Paramount-MCA offering is practical.
It isn't. . . . Why would I consider giving up Fox, a proven commodity," for an unknown venture?
Fox attracts a young audience with shows such as "Married . . . With Children," its most successful series. 

Textron Inc., hampered by a slowdown in its defense sales, reported an 8% decline in per-share earnings on nearly flat revenue for its third quarter. 

The aerospace and financial services concern said net income fell 5% to $59.5 million from $62.8 million.
Revenue of $1.73 billion was almost unchanged from last year's $1.72 billion.
Per-share net of 66 cents, down from 72 cents, fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding. 

The company said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business, lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets.
Net was aided by a lower income tax rate.
Profit before taxes fell 17% to $84.4 million from $101.4 million. 

For the nine months, Textron reported net of $182.1 million, or $2.06 a share, on revenue of $5.41 billion.
A year ago, net was $170.4 million, or $1.93 a share, on revenue of $5.3 billion.
The nine-month results included a $9.5 million special charge in 1989 for an arbitration settlement related to past export sales, and $29.7 million in extraordinary charges in 1988 related to a former line of business and early redemption of debt. 

Textron said that nine-months' results don't include earnings of Avdel PLC, a British maker of industrial fasteners, but do include interest costs of $16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel.
A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of Federal Trade Commission concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of two kinds of rivets. 

For the quarter, Textron said aerospace revenue, including Bell helicopter and jet-engine manufacture, declined 9.8% to $755.9 million from $838.3 million, an indication of slowing government defense work. 

American Express Co. posted a 21% increase in third quarter net income despite a sharp rise in reserves for Third World loans at its banking unit. 

Aided by a sharp gain in its travel business, American Express said net rose to $331.8 million, or 77 cents a share, from $273.9 million, or 64 cents a share. 

The year-earlier figures included $9.9 million, or three cents a share, in income from discontinued operations.
Income from continuing operations was up 26%.
Revenue rose 24% to $6.5 billion from $5.23 billion. 

The travel, investment services, insurance and banking concern added $110 million to reserves for credit losses at its American Express Bank unit, boosting the reserve to $507 million as of Sept. 30.
The bank's Third World debt portfolio totals $560 million, down from $2.2 billion at the end of 1986.
The bank charged off $53 million in loans during the quarter. 

At the American Express Travel Related Services Co. unit, net rose 17% to a record $240.8 million on a 19% revenue increase.
The figures exclude businesses now organized as American Express Information Services Co. American Express card charge volume rose 12%.
Travel sales rose 11%, led by gains in the U.S. 

At IDS Financial Services, the financial planning and mutual fund unit, net rose 19% to a record $47.6 million on a 33% revenue gain.
Assets owned or managed rose 20% to $45 billion, and mutual fund sales rose 45% in the quarter to $923 million. 

American Express Bank earnings fell 50% to $21.3 million from $42.5 million despite a 29% revenue gain.
The results include $106 million of tax benefits associated with previous years' Third World loan activity, compared with $15 million a year earlier. 

Profit rose 38% at American Express Information Services to $21.6 million.
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., as previously reported, had net of $65.9 million, reversing a $3.5 million loss a year earlier; its latest results include a $37 million gain from the sale of an institutional money management business.
American Express's share of Shearson's earnings was $41 million, after preferred stock dividends; it owns about 68% of Shearson's common. 

For the nine months, American Express said net rose 11% to $899.8 million, or $2.09 a share, from $807.5 million, or $1.89 a share.
Revenue rose 24% to $18.73 billion from $15.09 billion. 

As the Hunt brothers' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year, Minpeco S.A. has proposed a deal to settle its huge claim against the troubled Texas oil men.
But the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in September 1988. 

The Peruvian mineral concern's $251 million claim stems from 1988 jury award in a case stemming from the brothers' alleged attempts to corner the 1979-80 silver market.
Minpeco now says it is willing to settle for up to $65.7 million from each brother, although the actual amount would probably be much less. 

Although the proposal must be approved by federal Judge Harold C. Abramson, W. Herbert Hunt has agreed to the Peruvian mineral concern's proposal.
Nelson Bunker Hunt is considering it, although his attorney says he won't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the Internal Revenue Service, which claims the brothers owe $1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases. 

The tentative agreement between the IRS and Nelson Bunker Hunt is awaiting U.S. Justice Department approval.
Under it, the former billionaire's assets would be liquidated with the IRS getting 80% of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors, including Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., which is seeking repayment of a $36 million loan. 

A similiar proposal has been made in the W. Herbert Hunt case although he and the IRS are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings. 

In both cases, Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie.
With support from the IRS, Manufacturers Hanover has filed suit asking Judge Abramson to subordinate Minpeco's claim to those of Manufacturer Hanover and the IRS. Minpeco has threatened a "volcano" of litigation if the Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit attempts to force such a plan through the court. 

Minpeco said it wouldn't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the W. Herbert Hunt case is approved by Judge Abramson, who will consider the proposal at a hearing next week. 

Minpeco attorney Thomas Gorman decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the W. Herbert Hunt case but Hugh Ray, attorney for Manufacturers Hanover, called it "silly" and said he would fight it in court. 

"The thing is so fluid right now that there's really no way to say what will happen," says Justice Department attorney Grover Hartt III, who represents the IRS in the case. "Developments like this are hard to predict." 

They didn't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as scheduled, and they didn't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either.
But you knew that, didn't you? 

They are supposed to play the game next Tuesday, in Candlestick Park here.
The theory is that the stadium, damaged by Tuesday's earthquake, will be repaired by then, and that people will be able to get there.
Like just about everything else, that remains to be seen.
Aftershocks could intervene.
But, at least, the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side. 

It may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday's quake, but the name of this column is "On Sports," so I feel obliged to do so.
You might be interested to know that baseball, not survival, appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd that had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, a half-hour before game time, when the quake struck.
As soon as the tremor passed, many people spontaneously arose and cheered, as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show. 

One fan, seated several rows in front of the open, upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed, faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted, "We arranged that just for you guys!" I thought and, I'm sure, others did: "You shouldn't have bothered." 

I'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster, a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City, Mich., so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things: the urge to talk about them.
Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people's faces and asking how they "feel" about one calamity or another, fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat. 

"It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by," said one man, describing my own reaction.
A women said she saw the park's light standards sway.
A man said he saw the upper rim undulate.
I saw neither. 

Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding, the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played. "I was near the top of the stadium, and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat, but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes," confessed a friend. "I guess I thought, `This is the World Series and I'm not gonna wimp out!'" 

Here in the Global Village, though, folks do not stay uninformed for long.
Electrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park, but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful.
Within a few minutes, the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear.
Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5, then 6.9, then 7.0.
A section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed, as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland.
People had died. 

At 5:40 p.m., scheduled game time having passed, some fans chanted "Let's Play Ball." No longer innocent, they qualified as fools.
The stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward; the announcement, made over police bullhorns, cited the power outage, but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend.
Outside, I spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete. "Pieces of Candlestick," they said. 

The crowd remained good natured, even bemused.
TV reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while, a few feet away, others watched the interviews on their portable TVs.
The only frenzy I saw was commercial: Booths selling World Series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items. 

The traffic jam out of the park was monumental.
It took me a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle, and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a half-block away.
The six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours. 

At my hotel, the Westin, power was out, some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage, but little else.
With Garpian randomness, a hotel across the street, the Amfac, had been hit harder: A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away. 

The Westin staff had, kindly, set out lighted candles in the ballroom, prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets.
I fell asleep on the lobby floor, next to a man wearing a Chicago Cubs jacket.
I expected him to say, "I told you so," but he already was snoring. 

The journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the World Series seem unimportant.
My response was that sports rarely are important, only diverting, and the quake merely highlighted that fact. 

Should the rest of the Series be played at all?
Sure.
The quake and baseball weren't related, unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 Olympics.
That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience, and seems doomed to repeat it. 

Two ironies intrude.
This has been widely dubbed the BART Series, after the local subway line, and the Bay Bridge Series.
Flags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti, the late baseball commissioner, and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins.
A Series that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided Detroit-over-San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way.
Still, its edge is lost.
It now will be played mostly for the record, and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible, without "off" days. 

And I will never again complain about a rainout. 

Democracy can be cruel to politicians: Sometimes it forces them to make choices.
Now that the Supreme Court opened the door on the subject of abortion, politicians are squinting under the glare of democratic choice.
Their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us. 

Republicans are squinting most painfully, at least at first, which is only fair because they've been shielded the most.
So long as abortion was a question for litigation, not legislation, Republicans could find political security in absolutism.
They could attract one-issue voters by adopting the right-to-life movement's strongest position, even as pro-choice Republicans knew this mattered little on an issue monopolized by the court.
Now it matters. 

Much of Washington thought it detected George Bush in a characteristic waffle on abortion the past week.
Only a month ago he'd warned Congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest.
Last Friday, after Congress passed it anyway, he hinted he was looking for compromise.
Was the man who once was pro-choice, but later pro-life, converting again? 

In fact, Mr. Bush's dance was more wiggle than waffle.
Pro-life advocates say the White House never wavered over the veto.
Christopher Smith (R., N.J.), a pro-life leader in the House, suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states.
The White House, never eager for a fight, was happy to try, which is why George Bush said he was looking for "flexibility" last week. 

When Democrats refused to budge, pro-life Republicans met at the White House with Chief of Staff John Sununu on Monday, and Mr. Bush quickly signaled a veto.
Amid charges of "timidity" on Panama and elsewhere, the president wasn't about to offend his most energetic constituency. 

The GOP doubters were in Congress.
In last week's House vote, 41 Republicans defected.
After the vote, Connecticut Rep. Nancy Johnson rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to Mr. Bush urging him not to veto.
Even such a pro-life stalwart as Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) had counseled some kind of compromise.
The Senate passed the same bill yesterday, with a veto-proof majority of 67. 

The manuevering illustrates an emerging Republican donnybrook, pacified since the early 1980s.
At the 1988 GOP convention, abortion was barely discussed at all, though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment.
Ms. Johnson made a passionate statement to the platform committee, but she was talking to herself. 

Now many Republicans are listening.
They're frightened by what they see in New Jersey, and especially Virginia, where pro-life GOP candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion.
Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant, says the two GOP candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first. (In Virginia, Marshall Coleman and his running mate, Eddy Dalton, are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest.) But Mr. Mahe adds, "The net loser in the next few years is the right-to-life side." 

Darla St. Martin, of the National Right to Life Committee, says exit polls from the 1988 election had single-issue, pro-life voters giving Mr. Bush about five more percentage points of support than pro-choice voters gave Michael Dukakis.
But the Supreme Court's opening of debate may have changed even that.
GOP pollster Neil Newhouse, of the Wirthlin Group, says polls this summer showed that the single-issue voters had about evened out.
Polls are no substitute for principle, but they'll do for some politicians. 

The Republican danger is that abortion could become for them what it's long been for Democrats, a divisive litmus test.
It's already that in the Bush administration, at least for any job in which abortion is even remotely an issue. 

Oklahoma official Robert Fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the Department of Health and Human Services after right-to-life activists opposed him.
Caldwell Butler, a conservative former congressman, was barred from a Legal Services post, after he gave wrong answers on abortion.
Even the president's doctor, Burton Lee, has said on the record that he'd love to be surgeon general but couldn't pass the pro-life test. 

In the case of HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the Republican coalition.
After Mr. Sullivan waffled on abortion last year, the White House appeased right-to-lifers by surrounding him with pro-life deputies.
Their views on health care and welfare didn't much matter, though HHS spends billions a year on both.
It makes only a handful of abortion-related decisions. 

Though Democrats can gloat at all this for now, they may want to contain their glee.
On abortion, their own day will come.
Eventually even Republicans will find a way to frame the issue in ways that expose pro-choice absolutism.
Does the candidate favor parental consent for teen-age abortions? (The pro-choice lobby doesn't.) What about banning abortions in the second and third trimesters? (The lobby says no again.) 

Democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise, toward the unpolarizing middle.
Roe v.
Wade pre-empted political debate, so the extremes blossomed.
Now the ambivalent middle, a moral majority of sorts, is reasserting itself.
Within a few years, the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted, but not completely banned.
This is where the voters are, which is where politicians usually end up. 

Switzerland's wholesale price index increased 0.3% in September from August, and was up 3.9% from a year ago, marking the first time this year that the index has fallen below 4% on a year-to-year basis, the government reported. 

The government attributed the 0.3% month-to-month rise in the index largely to higher energy prices. 

In August, the index was up 0.2% from the previous month, and was up 4.5% on a year-to-year basis. 

The wholesale price index, based on 1963 as 100, was 180.9 in September. 

Business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake-ravaged California would total at least $2.5 billion. 

"That is a minimum figure, and I underscore minimum," said House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) after conferring with California lawmakers. "It's impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time." 

The Office of Management and Budget has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs.
And California's 45-member delegation in the House is expected to propose that emergency funds be added to a stop-gap spending bill that the House Appropriations Committee is to consider Monday. 

For the most part, major corporations' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by Tuesday's earthquake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
One of the last big employers in the Silicon Valley to report in, Seagate Technology, said it expects to be back at full strength Monday.
The day before the quake, Seagate completed three days of emergency training and drills. 

Echoing the response of almost all big corporations in the Bay Area, Don Waite, Seagate's chief financial officer, said, "I wouldn't expect this to have any significant financial impact." 

The city's recovery from the earthquake was uneven.
Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90% of their usual capacity, but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled, leaving the previously full hotel with an 80% vacancy rate.
City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings, but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled.
Among the city's banks, Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open.
The closed branches, in San Francisco, Hayward, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz, sustained structural damage.
Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line.
Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America's Concord office, and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles, the bank said. 

Wells Fargo & Co. said its Emergency Operations Committee -- which met all night Tuesday -- moved its global-funds transfer system to El Monte, Calif., 500 miles to the south.
Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed, while 23 of 600 automated-teller machines remained out of order. 

The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake's epicenter, 80 miles south of San Francisco.
Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly $600 million.
Santa Clara County has a running total so far of $504 million, excluding the hard-hit city of Los Gatos. 

Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday; a section of I-880, a twotiered highway, collapsed in Oakland, causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake. 

San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated that damages to the city total $2 billion.
That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished, peeled business facades south of Market Street, and houses in the city's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations.
Many streets and sidewalks buckled, and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured. 

The federal funds would go to a range of programs, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration, according to Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.). 

FEMA, which coordinates federal disaster relief, is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo, which hit the Carolinas last month.
It is likely to get as much as $800 million initially in additional funds, and eventually could get more than $1 billion, according to Mr. Fazio, a member of the House Appropriations Committee. 

White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements.
The Bush administration has at its disposal $273 million in funds remaining from the $1.1 billion Congress released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo. 

"We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate, short-term requirements," Mr. Fitzwater said.
He added that the Office of Management and Budget, the Transportation Department and other agencies are "developing longer-term legislation" that should be ready soon. 

Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges.
California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state. 

Some things can't be repaired.
The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $10 million to $15 million in damage, including shattered porcelains and stone figures.
Its neighbor, the De Young Museum, totaled $3 million to $5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture. 

The city's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls, and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor. 

The ground along the Embarcaderothe street that skirts the city's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped six inches after the quake, wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers.
At San Francisco International Airport, shock waves wrecked the control tower, knocking down computers and shattering glass.
Offices of the city's Rent Board were destroyed. 

Mayor Agnos's $2 billion estimate doesn't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city, some of which remained closed.
A major chunk of the $2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency, said a spokesman for Mr. Agnos. "All of the city's $5.9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours" on overtime salaries, he said. 

Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices. 

At Fireman's Fund Corp., a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake, and the company is braced for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential and 35,000 business policyholders in the affected area. 

"Claims range from a scratched fender -- and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this -- to a major processing plant," a spokesman said. "We're delivering a check for $750,000 to an automotive business in Berkeley that burned on Tuesday." 

Fireman's is part of a $38 million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the Bay Bridge, which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income. 

California lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a $100 million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster, as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads. 

In addition, under the highway-relief program, the federal government provides 100% of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort.
After that, the federal share diminishes.
For interstate highways, the federal share normally would drop to 90% of the cost of repairs, and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost.
But lawmakers want to extend the period for 100% federal funding for several months. 

Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo -- South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to an aide to Rep. Fazio. 

Meanwhile, the FEMA announced a toll-free telephone number (800-462-9029) to expedite service to victims of the earthquake.
Lines will be available 24 hours a day to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone. 

Transportation officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning Monday and growing worse over the next several weeks.
Some 250,000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco daily.
Officials say it is clear that alternate routes can't handle the overflow. 

The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem.
Moreover, state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours.
Even so, "We're looking for chaos," said George Gray, a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation. "If there's any way you can do it, you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while." 

Most of San Francisco's tourists and business travelers already have left -- despite hotel's offers of rate cuts. "Everyone left," said Peter Lang, reservations manager of the Mark Hopkins Hotel. 

The Westin St. Francis hotel, which survived the 1906 earthquake and fire, currently is less than 50% occupied. "We still have our die-hard baseball fans," a spokesman said. "One lady from New York said she's not going home until the {World Series} is over." 

Gerald F. Seib and Joe Davidson in Washington contributed to this article. 

Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California's Department of Transportation, employees familiar with the project say. 

The test project -- which reportedly survived Tuesday's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings. 

State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns, wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed, that was responsible for the collapse. 

The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake, although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared. 

Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days.
Red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete.
Giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment, preparing to lift off chunks of the debris. 

In Sacramento, a transportation department spokesman said he couldn't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work.
However, he asserted that the department hadn't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire Cypress structure. 

Moreover, other officials noted, snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting, even if it were technologically feasible. 

Knowledgeable employees said the retrofitting, which hadn't yet been budgeted, was part of a planned, three-stage reinforcement of the Cypress structure begun by the California transportation department several years ago.
The Cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes.
The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California, when numerous bridges collapsed. 

"We had just finished phase two" of the Cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock, a state DOT engineer said.
After completing installation of the jackets on "one frame" of the freeway last year, the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design. 

Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by "the difficulty of designing" the jackets.
The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel, then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed. 

The employees also said the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns.
One preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as much as $50 million. 

The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials.
Gov. George Deukmejian, who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake, called for an immediate investigation. 

"I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every day," said Richard Katz, a state legislator who is chairman of the California Assembly's transportation committee.
He said he would convene hearings within two weeks. 

The Cypress structure opened in June 1957, and as such, like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area, does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support.
The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake. 

Transportation department officials, however, said they were as surprised as anyone by the Cypress destruction.
They said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well, although they were working on ways to bolster them. 

"Unfortunately, there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes, and that is an earthquake," said Burch Bachtold, San Francisco district director for the transportation department. 

He said: "We know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to" reinforce the columns. 

Ko Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader's Digest. "Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news," says Mr. Shioya. "But one gets fed up with importing information and news." 

Mr. Shioya has turned the tables.
Today, he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine, the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business.
After a slick redesign, the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company, Keizaikai Corp., the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services, book publishing and a tourist agency.
Printed in the U.S. and carrying the line "The Insider's Japan," Business Tokyo's October cover story was "The World's No. 1 Customer" -- Japanese women. 

Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing, after making major investments in entertainment, real estate and banking companies here.
Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market, including the New York-based investment banker Veronis, Suhler & Associates.
And they are quietly linking up with U.S. publishing trade groups. 

"Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries," said John Veronis, chairman of Veronis Suhler.
While there aren't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp. 's recent $3.4 billion agreement to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., observers don't rule out a transaction of that size. "The Japanese take the long view." said Mr. Veronis. "It may not be weeks or months, but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable, they will move on a deal," he said. 

In recent months, three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns -- including Nikkei Business Publications, Nikkei Home (no relation), and Magazine House -- applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America, which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines. 

Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business Tokyo are considered groundbreakers.
When Keizaikai launched Business Tokyo in 1987, it appealed to a more multinational audience.
The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard, and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers. 

American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling.
Susumu Ohara, president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc., publisher of the Japan Economic Journal, said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine. 

"The Japanese are in the early stage right now," said Thomas Kenney, a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader's Digest Association's new Magazine Publishing Group. "Before, they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft.
Now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as Nabisco is a franchise." 

The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the Soviet Union is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of U.S. corn. 

Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn, bringing their U.S. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons. 

In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the corn contract for December delivery jumped 5.75 cents a bushel to settle at $2.44 a bushel. 

The Soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the Soviet Union to buy this fall, the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the U.S.
That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the Soviet Union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons. 

One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts.
That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn. 

By some estimates, several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn.
By buying futures contracts, these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver. 

Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts.
Among other things, the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union. 

On top of all this, corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio.
The harvest delays, however, are expected to be temporary.
Balmy temperatures are forecast for next week, said Robert Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp., Chicago. 

Many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies.
The heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally. 

Wheat futures prices rose slightly. 

In other commodity markets yesterday: 

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices declined.
A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders.
December delivery gold fell $1.80 an ounce to $370.60.
December silver eased 2.7 cents an ounce to $5.133.
January platinum was down $3.60 an ounce at $491.10.
One price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2% in the consumer price index for September, an analyst said.
He noted that the "core inflation rate," which excludes food and energy, was also low at 0.2%.
Other news that weighed on the market: Initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last week; American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will reduce its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition; the oil market turned weaker; there wasn't any investor demand for bullion; and the dollar strengthened during the day, putting pressure on gold.
Also, the analyst said, economic circumstances are such that both South Africa and the Soviet Union, the principal gold and platinum producers, are being forced to continue selling the metals.
Both are in great need of foreign exchange, and South Africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments, he said. "Putting it all together, we have a negative scenario that doesn't look like it will improve overnight," he said. 

COPPER: Futures prices recovered in quiet trading.
The December contract rose 1.50 cents a pound to $1.2795.
That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week, mostly in reaction to last Friday's stock market plunge, which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper, a leading industrial metal.
In recent days, however, there has been increased purchasing of copper in London, an analyst said.
Some of this buying was by Japan, which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, Highland Valley mine in British Columbia, and the Cananea mine in Mexico, which are major shippers to Japan.
The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing, but even if any of these mines begin operating soon, their output won't be significant until at least the end of the year, analysts note.
So, one analyst said, even though the long-term production problems may be easing, there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months, when inventories will remain relatively low. 

ENERGY: Crude oil prices ended mixed.
West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell 14 cents a barrel to $20.42.
But so-called outer month contracts finished higher.
For instance, December contracts for WTI rose 17 cents to $20.42.
Most energy futures opened lower, following Wednesday's market downturn.
But a flurry of late trading yesterday beefed up prices.
Heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well. 

I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries.
If the whole story were told, it would read something like this: 

-- During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and "Use of Proceeds" confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made. 

-- The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings (and management bonuses); the price, a sea of bad loans. 

-- For the past several years, the banks, lacking a private navy to enforce their interests, have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits. 

-- The Treasury wisely has refused, but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price: either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans (the Brady Plan). 

-- The banks will threaten not to make further loans, but in truth, lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy, they have no alternative but to go along.

Westmoreland Coal Co., realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity, reported sharply improved third-quarter results. 

The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was $5.9 million, or 71 cents a share, on revenue of $145.4 million.
For the year-earlier period, the company reported a loss of $520,000 or six cents a share. 

In the latest nine months, the company earned $8.5 million, or $1.03 a share.
Last year's net loss of $3,524,000 included a benefit of $1,640,000 from an accounting change.
Revenue for the nine months rose to $449 million from $441.1 million. 

In an interview, Pemberton Hutchinson, president and chief executive, cited several reasons for the improvement: higher employee productivity and "good natural conditions" in the mines, as well as lower costs for materials, administrative overhead and debt interest. 

In the latest nine months, Mr. Hutchinson said, total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier.
In addition, long-term debt has been trimmed to about $72 million from $96 million since Jan. 1.
He predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters. 

Westmoreland's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region.
The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News, Va.
Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage, including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas. 

For the past couple of years, Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business.
Marginal operations and assets have been sold.
The size of the company's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13.
About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated.
Even perks have been reduced.
For example, the chief executive himself now pays 20% of the cost of his health benefits; the company used to pay 100%. 

"I think the ship is now righted, the bilges are pumped and we are on course," Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program. "Much of what we set out to do is completed." 

But he cautioned that Westmoreland's third quarter is typically better than the fourth, so investors "shouldn't just multiply the third quarter by four" and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained.
One difference, he said, is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season. 

"I don't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now," he said. "We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient.
It's a process that never really ends." 

Nevertheless, Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be "solidly profitable" for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring "more of the same." For all of 1988, the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $134,000 on revenue of $593.5 million.
An accounting adjustment made net income $1.5 million, or 18 cents a share. 

In a move that complements the company's basic strategy, its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia.
Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines.
Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit's contribution to company results in the 1990s "will be exciting." He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River. 

Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5% range in the early 1990s. "We see coal's piece of the action growing," Mr. Hutchinson said. "Coal prices, while not skyrocketing, will grow modestly in real terms, we think." 

Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up $6.07 billion in the latest week, the sharpest increase in almost two years. 

The 473 funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group, rose to $356.1 billion, a record.
The $6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988. 

The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds.
Individual investors, represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories, pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds, said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist of the Institute. 

"Insitutional investors, on the other hand, reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday," Mr. Dreyer said. 

Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter.
The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55% from 8.60% the week earlier, Donoghue's said. 

At the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday, the average yield fell to 7.61% from 7.82%.
Likewise, certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday. 

The 142 institutional-type money funds rose $2.23 billion to $85.49 billion.
The 235 general-purpose funds increased $2.53 billion to $116.56 billion, while 96 broker-dealer funds increased $1.3 billion to $154.05 billion. 

Just because Stamford, Conn., High School did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash doesn't mean the city no longer owns the work of art, a federal judge ruled. 

The mural, now valued at $1.3 million according to appraisers, was tossed in a trash heap in 1971 by workers who were renovating the building.
The 100-foot-long mural, painted by James Daugherty in 1934, was commissioned by the federal Works Project Administration. 

After the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned Stamford graduate, it eventually was turned over to Hiram Hoelzer, a professional art restorer. 

Throughout the 1970s, Stamford school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural.
Apparently the officials didn't even know the mural was missing until 1980, when a researcher found that the painting was in Mr. Hoelzer's studio and questioned school officials about it. 

In 1986, Stamford officials thanked Mr. Hoelzer for taking care of the mural -- and demanded he return it as soon as possible.
Mr. Hoelzer, however, sued Stamford, claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it. 

But Judge Louis L. Stanton of federal court in Manhattan ruled that the city couldn't be faulted for waiting too long because it didn't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute.
The judge also ruled that the painting wasn't abandoned because officials didn't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it. 

Mr. Hoelzer didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the judge's decision.
The judge ordered that a hearing be held Nov. 17 to determine how much the city should pay Mr. Hoelzer for his services. 

Mary E. Sommer, corporate counsel for Stamford, said the city has discussed several possible plans for displaying the mural, which portrays various scenes from the Great Depression.
She said the mural "preserves an era in Stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done." 

THE SALES PITCH couldn't sound better.
First, there's the name: "asset-backed securities." Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing. 

And there's more.
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions.
Most earn high ratings from credit agencies.
Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues.
And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation's biggest institutional investors. 

Ready to jump?
Well, think twice.
The concept may be simple: Take a bunch of loans, tie them up in one neat package, and sell pieces of the package to investors.
But the simplicity may be misleading. 

Skeptics say the slightly higher returns aren't enough to compensate for the extra risk.
They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate.
Moreover, the securities were introduced only about 4 1/2 years ago; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession. 

"A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters," says Owen Carney, director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency. "We don't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn." 

Such concerns, however, haven't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street's hottest new products.
Since the spring of 1985, financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities. 

They have sold issues backed by car loans, boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans.
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans, as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares.
Last year, there was an issue of "death-backed bonds" -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders.
Some predict there will be "Third World bonds," backed by loans to Brazil, Argentina and other debt-ridden nations.
And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables, sometimes known as "plastic bonds." 

"This is the heyday of debt," says James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a newsletter. "Before the sun sets on the '80s, it seems nothing will be left unhocked." 

The result is a $45 billion market, according to Securities Data Co.
That includes more than $9.5 billion issued through August of this year, up sharply from $6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period -- and more than in all of 1987. 

Most issues have been sold to professional money managers, pension funds, bank trust departments and other institutions.
But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in, and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market.
The entry fee is affordable: Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $1,000. 

"We expect additional offerings" of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors, says Bill Addiss, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 

The process typically begins when an institution, such as Citibank or Sears, Roebuck & Co., takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust.
The trust then issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors.
Issues typically come with "credit enhancements," such as a bank letter of credit, and thus have received high credit ratings. 

Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers, while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions.
Asset-backed securities "are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds," says Craig J. Goldberg, managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 

But skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks. 

Consider a $500 million offering of 9% securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables.
The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues.
On a $10,000 investment, that's a difference of only $50 a year. 

That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street.
But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have, that margin is meaningless. 

"If you're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby, then even an extra 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) becomes an important consideration on a career basis," says Mr. Grant. "But if you're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again, then that isn't of overwhelming importance." 

Moreover, the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable, while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level.
That's why some investment managers, such as Alex Powers, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank's private banking division, don't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states, such as New York or California. 

But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts, such as retirement plans.
He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts. 

Another concern is liquidity, or how easily a security can be converted into cash.
The secondary, or resale, market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues.
That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature.
That's particularly true, analysts say, for certain of the securities, such as those backed by time-share loans. "You could see massive gyrations here because it's such a thinly traded market," says Jonathan S. Paris, a vice president of European Investors Inc., a New York investment-management firm. 

In addition, an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds, or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange, can simply check newspaper listings.
There aren't any such listings for asset-backed securities. 

Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem.
Investors, for instance, may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities.
It isn't. 

The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and "do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks, Citibank N.A., Citicorp or any affiliate thereof." In other words, if there's a problem, don't expect Citibank to come to the rescue.
The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency. 

That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities, as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received.
That also isn't easy. 

Take the "credit enhancements," which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company.
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities.
Nor does it cover the entire portfolio. 

Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue.
Still, they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim.
But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper.
When you buy an asset-backed issue, you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties.
If a bank's credit rating was lowered because of, say, its loans to Third World nations, that could also affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports. 

Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions.
But despite the credit enhancements, despite the high ratings, some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets.
At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs, asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times. 

At the very least, a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is, Treasurys.
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities, as well as make it tougher to unload the latter. 

But it could be much worse.
Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues.
For one thing, credit-card loans are unsecured.
In addition, they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession. 

"A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues, and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds," says Craig Corcoran of Davis/Zweig Futures Inc., an investment advisory firm. 

What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues? "Nope, we still say to stick with Treasurys," Mr. Corcoran replies.
Ratings, he notes, "are subject to change." 

All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people.
And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., of what he calls "DeVoe's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1: 

"More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations, scams and frauds of all time."

Mattel Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 73%, to $38 million, or 76 cents a share, from $21.9 million, or 45 cents a share, a year ago. 

Revenue rose 34% to $410 million from $306.6 million a year earlier. 

"Mattel's world-wide volume has grown 25% in a climate of relatively flat industry sales," said John W. Amerman, chairman.
He said the toy company's "prospects for a strong fourth quarter" are also good. 

Mattel attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world-wide sales of its Barbie doll, Hot Wheels cars, Disney toys and other well-known toy lines.
The company also cited retail trade and consumer demand for new products introduced this year, such as Cherry Merry Muffin and Turtle Tots. 

For the nine months, Mattel net more than doubled to $58.9 million, or $1.19 a share, from $25.4 million, or 53 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue rose 25%, to $877.6 million, from $702.4 million. 

Mattel said the company's sale of rights to land and buildings at its Hawthorne, Calif., headquarters resulted in a $13 million charge to third-quarter operating profit.
The charge didn't affect net for the quarter as it was offset by tax benefits. 

Mattel has purchased a new headquarters building in El Segundo, Calif., which it will occupy by the end of next year. 

American Brands Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 13%, reflecting strong gains in its tobacco and distilled spirits businesses. 

The company, which also has businesses in life insurance, office products and hardware, and home-improvement products, said net income rose to $166.4 million, or $1.71 a share, from $146.8 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier.
Year-earlier results for the quarter and the nine months were restated to reflect a change in accounting standards. 

Revenue declined 2%, to $3.06 billion from $3.13 billion, because of the sale of Southland Life in March, and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on overseas results. 

Operating profit for world-wide tobacco products rose 10% to $247.6 million.
For distilled spirits, operating profit rose 36%, to $24.8 million. 

In the first nine months, net rose 1.5%, to $458.8 million, or $4.76 a share, from $452 million, or $4.50 a share, a year earlier.
The year-earlier period included $40.1 million, or 41 cents a share, from discontinued operations.
Revenue rose to $9.03 billion from $8.98 billion. 

The average number of shares outstanding rose 2% in the third quarter but was down 4% for the nine months. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American Brands shares rose $1.75 to $73. 

NOW YOU SEE IT, now you don't. 

The recession, that is.
The economy's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up.
So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane. 

For the past seven years, investors have had the wind at their backs, in the form of a generally growing economy.
Some may have forgotten -- and some younger ones may never have experienced -- what it's like to invest during a recession.
Different tactics are called for, as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher. 

For those investors who believe -- or fear -- that 1990 will be a recession year, many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio. 

In a nutshell, pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in "defensive" industries.
A heavy dose of cash is prescribed, along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds. 

It's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand.
But that may not be possible, because recessions often take investors by surprise. "They always seem to come a bit later than you expect.
When they do hit, they hit fast," says David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc. 

Though he himself doesn't expect a recession soon, Mr. Wyss advises people who do that "the best thing to be in is long that is, 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds." 

The reason is simple, Mr. Wyss says: "Interest rates almost always decline during recession." As surely as a seesaw tilts, falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds.
They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do. 

That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds.
But short-term bonds can't rise too much, because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon.
Long-term bonds, with many years left before maturity, swing more widely in price. 

But not just any bonds will do.
Corporate bonds "are usually not a good bet in a recession," Mr. Wyss says.
As times get tougher, investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts.
This hurts the price of corporate bonds.
Also, he notes, "most corporate bonds are callable." 

That means that a corporation, after a specified amount of time has passed, can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value (plus, in some cases, a sweetener).
When interest rates have dropped, it makes sense for corporations to do just that; they then save on interest costs.
But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny. 

If corporate bonds are bad in recessions, junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all.
It's an "absolute necessity" to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing, says Avner Arbel, professor of finance at Cornell University. "Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside, and this could be a disaster." 

Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession, but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government.
During an economic slump, local tax revenues often go down, raising the risks associated with at least some municipals.
And, like corporates, many municipal bonds are callable. 

But a few experts, going against the consensus, don't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing.
One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach, director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co., a brokerage house in Houston, who thinks that "we're either in a recession or about to go into one." What's more, he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual: "Once the downturn comes, it's going to be very hard to reverse." 

Investors, he advises, "should be cautious," holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds.
Because he sees a "5% to 6% base rate of inflation in the economy," he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon. 

Instead, Mr. Beach says, investors "probably should be carrying a very high level of cash," by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills.
Greg Confair, president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown, Pa., also recommends that investors go heavily for cash.
He isn't sure a recession is coming, but says the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad. 

"This late in an expansion," the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession, Mr. Confair says.
The Federal Reserve Board's plan for a "soft landing," he says, requires the Fed to navigate "an ever-narrowing corridor." 

A soft landing isn't something that can be achieved once and for all, Mr. Confair adds.
It has to be engineered over and over again, month after month.
He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles "juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw." 

And, in a sense, that's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks -- the mainstay of most serious investors' portfolios.
It comes down to a question of whether to try to "time" the market. 

For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad, stocks have been rewarding long-term investments.
Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9% to 10%, including both dividends and price appreciation.
That's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid. 

Moreover, because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming, some analysts think investors shouldn't even worry too much about timing. "Trying to time the economy is a mistake," says David Katz, chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York.
Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years.
Investors who listened, and lightened up on stocks, "have just hurt themselves," he says. 

Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70% of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy.
Frequent trading runs up high commission costs.
And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market's gains over time. 

Still, few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming.
After all, in all five recessions since 1960, stocks declined.
According to Ned Davis, president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis, Fla., the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21%, and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started. 

By the time a recession is "official" (two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product), much of the damage to stocks has already been done-and, in the typical case, the recession is already half over.
About six months before a recession ends, stocks typically begin to rise again, as investors anticipate a recovery. 

The average recession lasts about a year.
Unfortunately, though, recessions vary enough in length so that the average can't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases. 

But whatever their advice about timing, none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession.
For the portion of an investor's portfolio that stays in stocks, professionals have a number of suggestions.
Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios -- that is, low prices in relation to the company's earnings per share. "Low P-E" stocks, he says, vastly outperform others "during a recession or bear market." In good times, he says, they lag a bit, but overall they provide superior performance. 

Prof.
Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies.
Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession, he says.
And in any case, he argues, stocks of small companies are "almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30, 1987, just before the crash." 

For example, Mr. Arbel says, stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow. (Cash flow, basically earnings plus depreciation, is one common gauge of a company's financial health.) That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash, Mr. Arbel says.
And it's way above the ratio (7.5 times cash flow) that bigger companies are selling for. 

Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in "defensive" industries.
Food, tobacco, drugs and utilities are the classic examples.
Recession or not, people still eat, smoke, and take medicine when they're sick. 

George Putnam III, editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston, offers one final tip for recession-wary investors. "Keep some money available for opportunities," he says. "If the recession does hit, there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest."

Italy's industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2% in June from a year earlier, the state statistical institute Istat said. 

The June increase compared with a rise of 10.5% in May from a year earlier. 

Domestic wholesale sales rose 11.9% from a year earlier, while foreign sales jumped 17.3%, Istat said. 

For the first six months, wholesale sales rose 12.3% from the year before, reflecting to a 11.5% jump in domestic sales and a 14.6% boost in foreign sales. 

Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6% in the January-June period from a year earlier.
Sales of consumer goods rose 6.9% in the same period, while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8% from a year ago. 

WASHINGTON LIES LOW after the stock market's roller-coaster ride. 

Lawmakers, haunted by charges that some of their comments contributed to the 1987 crash, generally shy away from calls for sweeping new legislation.
But a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will quiz SEC Chairman Breeden Wednesday, and Treasury Secretary Brady will go before the Senate Banking panel Thursday. 

The market's wild week may speed along the market-reform legislation that has been pending for months in the aftermath of the 1987 crash.
It may also expedite the SEC's modest pending changes in junk-bond disclosure rules and intensify the Treasury's look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short-term trades by pension funds. 

Brady and Breeden work well together on the plunge, despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden's nomination to the SEC post. 

BAKER FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics. 

Despite seeing his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither, the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut U.S. economic or military aid to force Israeli cooperation.
Baker nonetheless remains furious both at Shamir, for backing down on the elections, and at Shamir's rival, Peres, for political ineptitude in forcing a premature cabinet vote on Baker's plan. 

Meanwhile, some U.S. officials fear PLO chief Arafat is getting cold feet and may back off from his recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism.
He is under intense fire from other Palestinian groups; Syria is pushing Ahmad Jibril, whose terrorist band is blamed for the Pan Am 103 bombing, as an alternative to Arafat. 

DARMAN'S MANEUVERS on the budget and capital gains hurt him in Congress. 

Republicans as well as Democrats were angered by the budget director's rejection of Speaker Foley's effort to expedite a deficitcutting measure by stripping it of the capital-gains tax cut as well as pet Democratic projects.
Darman now blames the clash on miscommunication, but House GOP leader Michel, who carried the offer to him, observes, "I was speaking English at the time, and quite loud so I could be understood." 

Senate GOP leader Dole ridicules the budget chief on the Senate floor.
Democratic counterpart Mitchell, asked to interpret Darman's threat to make permanent the across-the-board Gramm-Rudman cuts that took effect this week, says, "I don't even bother to interpret them." 

But Darman suggests such tensions will dissipate quickly. "If I can show signs of maturity, almost anybody can," he jokes. 

HHS OFFICIALS expect Secretary Sullivan to continue a ban on research using fetal tissue. 

Before he was confirmed, Sullivan said he had "reservations about any blanket prohibitions on medical research." But now, an official says, he is "surrounded by right-to-lifers," who contend that any breakthroughs in fetal-tissue research could increase the demand for abortions. 

COOPERATION WANES on weapons development between the U.S. and Europe. 

Britain, France and Italy pull out of a proposal to build new NATO frigates; the U.S. and West Germany have each withdrawn from missile projects.
Defense experts say joint projects are increasingly squeezed by budget pressures and the desire to save domestic jobs; some also fear rising protectionism as European unity nears. 

BOTH SIDES NOW: Virginia GOP lieutenant governor candidate Eddy Dalton tries to have it both ways on the abortion issue.
Though she opposes abortion in almost all cases, she airs a TV commercial using pro-choice buzzwords. "A woman ought to have a choice in cases where her life or health are in danger and in cases of rape or incest," she proclaims. 

HOT TOPIC: Interest in the abortion issue is so great that the Hotline, a daily, computer-distributed political newsletter, comes up with a spinoff product called the Abortion Report dealing solely with its political implications. 

CONSERVATIVES EXPECT Bush to solidify their majority on a key court. 

Bush has three vacancies to fill on the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court, which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm-up for future Supreme Court nominees.
Conservatives now hold only a 5-4 edge.
One slot is expected to go to EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas, a black conservative; after mulling a fight, liberals now probably won't put up a major struggle against him. 

Other conservatives thought to be on the administration's short list include Washington lawyer Michael Uhlmann, who was passed over for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department, and Marshall Breger, chairman of a U.S. agency on administration. 

The Bush administration would also like to nominate a woman; one possibility is former Justice Department official Victoria Toensing. 

MINOR MEMOS: In the wake of the failed Panama coup, a bumper sticker appears: "Ollie Would Have Got Him." . . . Rep. Garcia, on trial for bribery and extortion, puts statements in the Congressional Record attributing missed votes to "scheduling conflicts." . . . A GOP Senate fund-raising letter from Sen. Burns of Montana is made to appear personally written, and its opening line is, "Please excuse my handwriting." But Burns confesses in an interview: "That's not my handwriting." 

IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence, it would probably be a one-word sentence: Diversify. 

Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc., serious investors have taken that advice to heart.
Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal's poll, providing an in-depth look at their portfolios. 

Those portfolios are remarkably diversified.
By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives, the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area, be it stocks, bonds or real estate. 

For example, about 88% of Journal readers owned stock (down slightly from 91% in a similar poll last year).
But only 17.5% said they had more than half their money in the stock market. 

Similarly, 57% of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund, and 33% own municipal bonds.
But only 6% to 7% of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives. 

The poll, conducted Aug. 7-28, also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics.
It found them in a cautious, but not downbeat, mood. 

Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire, 951 replied.
The response rate, more than 63%, allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence.
The results can't be extrapolated to all investors, though.
Journal readers are relatively affluent, with a median household income of between $75,000 and $99,000.
Nearly half of the respondents (47%) said their investment portfolio was worth $250,000 or more, and 17% said it was worth $1 million or more. 

The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets, but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago. 

For example, 12% of this year's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months.
Last year, only 8% were expecting a recession. 

An additional 56% of this year's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months.
Only 42% of last year's respondents anticipated slowing growth. 

Apparently, the respondents don't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much.
A slim majority (51%) think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989. 

Their verdict on real estate is almost the same.
Some 50% expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months. 

By contrast, only 32% expect an increase in the price of gold.
Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high, that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control. 

Even though only 12% actually predicted a recession, many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance.
Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession.
For the most part, the changes were "slight." 

The two-thirds who haven't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who "don't believe in trying to predict the markets" (about 31%) and investors who "don't expect a recession" (about 15%) or are "unsure if and when a recession might come" (about 22%). 

A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents.
Most own two to 10 stocks, and buy or sell no more than three times a year.
Some 71% had bought some stock in the past year; only 57% had sold any. 

But the lurking shadow of 1987's stock-market crash still seems dark.
About 33% considered another crash "likely," while about 63% said one is "unlikely." Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year's poll. 

And the respondents' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual.
About 60% of them said they would "ordinarily" have at least 25% of their money in stocks.
But as of August, only 50% actually had stock-market investments of that size. 

Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll.
But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious, rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon. 

Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau. 

The Federal Trade Commission ruled that five major title-insurance companies illegally fixed prices for title search-and-examination services by participating in joint "rating bureaus" in six states. 

The FTC ordered the companies not to use rating bureaus in those six states.
The commission order named the following companies: Ticor Title Insurance Co. of California, a unit of Los Angeles-based Ticor; Chicago Title Insurance Co. and Safeco Title Insurance Co., units of Chicago Title & Trust Co.; Lawyers Title Insurance Corp., a unit of Richmond, Va.-based Universal Corp.; and Stewart Title Guaranty Co., a unit of Houston-based Stewart Information Services Corp. Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co. 

The FTC ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by fixing rates in the following states: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Arizona and Montana.
The FTC first issued an administrative complaint in the case in 1985. 

John Christie, a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of "second-guessing" state-level regulations, with which, he said, his clients had complied. "I expect all the companies to appeal," he added. 

A lawyer for Lawyers Title said that, because the named companies no longer use the type of cooperative rating bureaus attacked by the FTC, the commission's order won't have much practical impact.
Officials for the other named companies didn't return telephone calls seeking comment. 

Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach, Calif., thrift. 

Mercury, which has assets of more than $2 billion and 24 branches in California, said the action to improve its regulatory capital position is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation.
Mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco. 

Mercury's stock closed yesterday at $4.875, unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided, under pressure from their leaders, not to offer their own proposal, placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush's legislative priority. 

A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets.
The plan was complete except for finishing touches, and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday. 

But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut, called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday.
Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist.
Afterward, leaders of the dissident Democrats relented, and said they wouldn't offer their own proposal as they had planned. 

The decision is a setback for President Bush, who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate.
Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage.
Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder. 

Still, Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment, predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year.
He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect. 

But Sen. Mitchell, buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats, strongly disagreed.
Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president's initiative would fail this year.
Yesterday, in an interview, he added that the Democrats' decision "increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year." Mr. Mitchell's first victory came last week, when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that didn't contain a capital-gains provision.
That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill, now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators.
The House version of the bill does include the tax cut. 

Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill, perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation.
To help lay the groundwork for that fight, President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue. 

The president apparently will have only one bill to push, Sen. Packwood's, and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it. "I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor," said Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), a leader of those Democrats. 

The Packwood plan, as expected, would allow individuals to exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year.
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held, until it reached a maximum of 35% after seven years.
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1.
As an alternative, taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index. 

For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29% for corporate assets held for 15 years. 

The Packwood plan also would include a proposal, designed by Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts.
The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home, education expenses and medical expenses.
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs, but would be subject to tax though no penalty. 

Sheldon B. Lubar, chairman of Lubar & Co., and John L. Murray, chairman of Universal Foods Corp., were elected to the board of this engine maker.
They succeed Robert W. Kasten and John R. Parker, who reached the mandatory retirement age. 

Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy maker, reported third-quarter earnings increased 73% from a year earlier on a 9.4% sales gain, reflecting improved margins. 

Hasbro said it had net income of $31.3 million, or 53 cents a share, up from $18.1 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier, when it took a pretax charge of $10 million after dropping development of an interactive video entertainment system.
Revenue rose to $403 million from $368.4 million. 

The company cited sales gains at its Milton Bradley and Playskool units and in its international business for the increase in revenue.
Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive, added that Hasbro's new line of battery-powered racing cars, called Record Breakers, and its acquisition of Cabbage Patch Kids, Scrabble and other lines from Coleco Industries Inc. puts the company "in a good position as we enter the Christmas buying season." 

For the first nine months of the year, Hasbro's net income rose 33% to $68.2 million, or $1.15 a share, from $51.3 million, or 88 cents a share, on a 3.1% increase in revenue to $992.7 million from $963 million a year earlier. 

New York Times Co. 's third-quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990. 

The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV system.
However, operating profit fell 35% to $16.4 million.
The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines, lower earnings from the forest-products group, and what is proving to be a nagging major problem, continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times, the company's flagship daily newspaper. 

In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, New York Times closed at $28.125 a share, down 37.5 cents. 

Analysts said the company's troubles mirror those of the industry.
Retail advertising, which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers, largely isn't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected.
At the same time, newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising, especially in its financial component.
Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9%, a reflection, in part, of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine. 

"We expect next year to be a fairly soft year in newspaper-industry advertising," said John Morton, an analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan. "Next year, earnings will hold steady, but we just don't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising." 

John S. Reidy, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said, "The Times faces the same problem of other publishers: linage is down.
It will be hard to do handstands until real linage starts heading back up." 

In the quarterly report, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, New York Times Co. chairman and chief executive officer, said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue.
Analysts agreed with company expectations that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990.
Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in Edison, N.J., in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs. 

"With the Edison plant coming on line next summer, the Times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future," said Peter Appert, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell. "But many newspapers are facing similar comparisons." 

The sale of the company's cable franchise brought an after-tax gain of $193.3 million, part of which will be used to reduce debt.
The company also has a stock-repurchase plan. 

Analysts said they were impressed by the performance of the company's newspaper group, which consists of the Times, 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune; group operating profit for the quarter increased slightly to $34.9 million from $34.5 million on flat revenue. 

Drexel Burnham's Mr. Reidy pointed out that "profits held up in a tough revenue environment.
That's a good sign when profits are stable during a time revenue is in the trough." 

Chase Manhattan Corp., after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building, has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower. 

Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970. 

The current transaction cost the bank approximately $140 million.
Of that amount, $20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself. 

The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers, most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank's new back office center is completed in 1993.
The move is part of Chase's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof.
The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza. 

As part of its decision to leave the building, Chase tried to sell its interest, along with the Atlas estate's interest, shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash.
Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations.
He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $400 million to $475 million, but didn't get an offer for more than $375 million. 

As the building's new owner, Chase will have its work cut out for it.
Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space, and Salomon Brothers Inc., whose headquarters is in the building, also plans to move shortly.
In addition, another major building tenant, Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities, likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation. 

New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants.
Even with its striking views of the New York harbor, the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards.
And Chase will have to spend approximately $50 million to remove asbestos from the premises. 

What if it happened to us? 

In the wake of the earthquake in California and the devastation of Hurricane Hugo, many companies in disaster-prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness.
Some, particularly in West Coast earthquake zones, are dusting off their evacuation plans, checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes.
Others say they feel confident that steps they've already taken would see them through a disaster. 

Preparedness involves more than flashlights and fire alarms these days.
Some big companies have teams of in-house experts focusing on safety and business resumption.
Many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency offices in safe regions, hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly.
That means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm's way. 

Some businesses -- like Disneyland -- claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis, they would be able to feed and care for their people for as long as five days. 

"Self-sufficiency has to be the cornerstone of your plan," says Stephanie Masaki-Schatz, manager of corporate emergency planning at Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles. "If you don't save your critical people, you won't be able to bring up your vital business functions." 

Although ARCO's head office, more than 300 miles from the epicenter, wasn't affected by this week's tremors, Ms. Masaki-Schatz used the occasion to distribute a three-page memo of "Earthquake Tips" to 1,200 ARCO employees. 

"You need to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone's attention," she says. "It was a good reminder that we all need to prepare prior to an event." 

The ARCO memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work, such as solid shoes and "heavy gloves to clear debris." It also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter.
Among the suggestions: Pantyhose and men's ties could be used for slings, while removable wooden shelves might aid in "breaking through office walls." 

ARCO maintains an office in Dallas that would take over if payroll operations in Pasadena were disrupted.
Two months ago the company set up a toll-free number, based outside California, to handle queries from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster. 

The ARCO plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are busier at certain times of the year.
This way, depending on when a quake might strike, priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line first. 

At Hewlett-Packard Co., the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures. "We were talking about scheduling a practice drill for November," says Joan Tharp, a spokeswoman. "Then we had a real one in the afternoon." 

The Palo Alto, Calif., computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home Wednesday.
Sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help Bay area clients who called with computer problems.
Hewlett-Packard also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations. "That means we can accept orders" and begin getting back to normal, says Ms. Tharp. 

Prompted by an earlier California earthquake, as well as a fire in a Los Angeles office tower, Great Western Bank in the past year hired three emergency planners and spent $75,000 equipping a trailer with communications gear to serve as an emergency headquarters. 

Although officials of the savings and loan, a unit of Great Western Financial Corp., used some of their new plans and equipment during this week's quake, they still lost touch for more than 24 hours with 15 branches in the affected areas, not knowing if employees were injured or vaults were broken open. 

"Some people flat out didn't know what to do," says Robert G. Lee, vice president for emergency planning and corporate security at Great Western. 

As it turned out, bank employees weren't hurt and the vaults withstood the jolts.
Still, says Mr. Lee: "We need to educate people that they need to get to a phone somehow, some way, to let someone know what their status is." 

Some companies are confident that they're prepared.
Occidental Petroleum Corp. holds regular evacuation drills and stocks food, oxygen and non-prescription drugs at checkpoints in its 16-story headquarters.
The company also maintains rechargeable flashlights in offices and changes its standby supply of drinking water every three months. 

"We feel we are doing everything we can," an Occidental spokesman says. 

Walt Disney Co. 's Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., stocks rescue equipment, medical supplies, and enough food and water to feed at least 10,000 visitors for as long as five days in the event that a calamity isolates the theme park. 

The park also has emergency centers where specially trained employees would go to coordinate evacuation and rescue plans using walkie-talkies, cellular phones, and a public-address system.
The centers are complete with maps detailing utility lines beneath rides and "safe havens" where people can be assembled away from major structures. 

Vista Chemical Co., with three chemical plants in and near Lake Charles, La., "prepares for every hurricane that enters the Gulf of Mexico," says Keith L. Fogg, a company safety director.
Hurricane Hugo, an Atlantic storm, didn't affect Vista.
But two other major storms have threatened operations so far this year, most recently Hurricane Jerry this week. 

Because hurricanes can change course rapidly, the company sends employees home and shuts down operations in stages -- the closer a storm gets, the more complete the shutdown.
The company doesn't wait until the final hours to get ready for hurricanes. "There are just tons of things that have to be considered," Mr. Fogg says. "Empty tank cars will float away on you if you get a big tidal surge." 

Still, Vista officials realize they're relatively fortunate. "With a hurricane you know it's coming.
You have time to put precautionary mechanisms in place," notes a Vista spokeswoman. "A situation like San Francisco is so frightening because there's no warning." 

Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of $2.7 million, or nine cents a share, for its first quarter ended Sept. 30, citing factors as varied as hurricane damage, an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar. 

In the year-ago period, the company earned $12.9 million, or 45 cents a share, on sales of $247 million.
Sales for the just-ended period fell to about $225 million, the maker of computer parts said. 

Nonetheless, Chairman Roger W. Johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter. "We are positioned to come through," he said, noting that the company's backlog was up from the previous quarter.
In its second quarter last year, Western Digital earned $12.7 million, or 44 cents a share, on sales of $258.4 million. 

Mr. Johnson said Western Digital's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo, losing three days' production because of the storm, which wrecked much of the Caribbean island's infrastructure.
Although the plant itself wasn't damaged, Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost.
The revenue will be regained in the current period, he added. 

There are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend, Mr. Johnson said, explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash. 

Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards.
Western Digital doesn't make the monitors. 

An accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital's equipment. 

"The other areas of the business -- storage and microcomputers -- were very good," Mr. Johnson said.
He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array, VGA, graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter, EGA, which has a lower resolution standard, technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units.
Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift, he said, "but we were able to respond much more quickly." 

Still, Mr. Johnson said, "our stock is grossly undervalued." He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10% over the last few quarters, while maintaining research and development at about 8% to 9% of sales. 

As part of its reorganization this week, Western Digital has divided its business into two segments -- storage products, including controllers and disk drives; and microcomputer products, which include graphics, communications and peripheral control chips. 

Graphics, communications and peripheral control chips were combined because, increasingly, multiple functions are being governed by a single chip. 

Storage, which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives, represents nearly two-thirds of the company's business.
Disk drives, which allow a computer to access its memory, generated 38% more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier. 

Computer parts are getting ever smaller, Mr. Johnson said, a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business.
As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry, he said, Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts. 

Next year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same citya new headquarters and, a block away, a modern $100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant.
The plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with AT&T. 

About half of Western Digital's business is overseas, and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue.
Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company, he said, particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there.
Capitalizing on that presence, Western Digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in Europe. 

Missouri farmer Blake Hurst writing in the fall issue of the Heritage Foundation's Policy Review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county: 

Of course I'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator.
But I'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I've seen (and smelt) in these parts.
An incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door -- on our farm there are four unoccupied houses.
On my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning, I drive by another four empty houses.
A community of abandoned farmsteads, failing businesses, and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one. . . . The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this: If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem cannot be built in Atchinson County, what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces?
After all, farmers here work with "hazardous" chemicals every day, many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator.
We know they are dangerous, but if handled with care, their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment. 

James F. Gero, former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc., and Richard J. Hatchett III, a Dallas investment banker, were elected directors of this medical-products concern, boosting the board to seven members. 

Millicom Inc. said it is one of two companies to receive a license to introduce and operate a cellular mobile telephone system in Pakistan. 

The market during the start-up is estimated at 25,000 subscribers.
A spokeswoman for Millicom, a telecommunications company, said she didn't know the value of the contract.
Cable & Wireless PLC of Britain won the other license. 

Millicom said it would build and operate the system in Pakistan with Comvik International AB, part of the Kinnevik group of Sweden, and Arfeen International, Pakistan. 

Ever since the hotly contested America's Cup race last year, the famous yachting match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it.
Now that a key member of the San Diego Yacht Club team is splitting off to form his own team, even more competition lies ahead. 

Peter Isler, the winning navigator in the past two America's Cup challenges, has split from the team led by Dennis Conner, skipper of the victorious Stars & Stripes, to form his own team for the next contest in 1992.
And, in addition to a crack team of sailors, Mr. Isler has lined up some real brass to help him finance the syndicate. 

Isler Sailing International's advisory board includes Ted Turner, Turner Broadcasting chairman and a former Cup victor; Peter G. Diamandis, head of Diamandis Communications, and Joseph B. Vittoria, chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc.
His steering committee includes other notable businessmen, including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney. 

"We have the structure, people and plan," Mr. Isler said in a statement.
Now, the first order of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat -- a new yacht will cost about $3 million alone, and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $25 million for a Cup challenge. 

The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers' 90-foot monohull.
In September, a New York appellate court overturned a state judge's ruling that awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team. 

Pending an appeal by the New Zealand team, led by Michael Fay, the finals for the next Cup challenge are scheduled to be held in mid-1992 in San Diego.
But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit, Mr. Conner's team has done little to begin gearing up to defend its title. 

"If you don't know what the rules of the game are, it's hard to start your fund-raising or design," said Dana Smith, an official with Team Dennis Conner.
The Conner team won't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined, Mr. Smith said, and the syndicate's budget could easily reach $30 million. 

But spokesmen for both Mr. Isler and Mr. Conner say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with Mr. Isler's desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now, rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen.
Mr. Smith and a spokesman for the America's Cup Organizing Committee insist that the added competition for the defender's spot will only improve the race. 

DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES Inc. said it offered $50 million of 9 1/2% debentures due 2001 at par.
The Little Rock, Ark., department-store retailer said proceeds will be used to reduce short-term debt.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. was the underwriter. 

After years of quarreling over Bonn's "Ostpolitik", West Germany and the U.S. appear to have shifted onto a united course in Eastern Europe. 

Bonn and Washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries, pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit.
Both hope to encourage pressure for change in East bloc countries still ruled by Stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for Poland, Hungary and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union.
West German officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for East Germany's fledgling reform movement. 

"The change taking place in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary has aroused new hope in both German states that reforms will be undertaken in {East Germany}, and that relations between the two German states, too, will get better," said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 

Addressing a conference of the New York-based Institute for East-West Security Studies in Frankfurt yesterday, Mr. Genscher said, "History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms." The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms, he said, is to create "an equitable and stable peaceful order in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals." 

Mr. Genscher and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, in separate speeches at the conference, appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in Hungary and Poland.
Bonn and Washington are leading supporters of Poland's request for a $1 billion stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund. 

"We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed.
We are prepared to support those changes," said Mr. Mosbacher.
U.S. curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to East bloc countries will remain in place, however. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday approved an $837.5 million aid package for Poland and Hungary that more than doubles the amount President Bush had requested.
The package was brought to the House just 15 days after it was introduced, indicating Congress's eagerness to reward Poland and Hungary for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms. 

The legislation, approved 345-47 and sent to the Senate, establishes two enterprise funds, to be governed by independent nonprofit boards, which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in Hungary and Poland.
The Polish fund would be seeded with $160 million, the Hungarian fund with $40 million. 

In addition, a group of 24 industrialized countries, including the U.S. and Japan and coordinated by the European Community Commission, has promised Poland and Hungary trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to $1.11 billion through the European Investment Bank, while the EC plans $222 million in direct aid. 

When Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to Poland Nov. 9, he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks ($1.6 billion) in new credit guarantees for industrial projects.
Last week, Bonn agreed to reschedule 2.5 billion marks in Polish debt that came due last year.
In addition, a one billion mark credit dating from 1974 is to be written off.
Poland's plan to switch to a free-market economy by 1991 is hampered by a foreign debt load of $39.2 billion. 

West Germany also has increased its credit guarantees to Hungary by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms, including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment.
An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. 

Deutsche Bank AG, which last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the Soviet Union, is now moving to become the first West German bank to set up independent business offices in Hungary and Poland as they shift to free-market economies.
A maxim of Frankfurt banking holds that wherever Deutsche Bank goes, other West German banks follow.
Indeed, at least four other West German banks are believed to be making inquiries. 

Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here, alleging that a group that holds 6.2% of its stock made "false, deceptive and misleading" statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements. 

Harley-Davidson's complaint claims that the group, led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer, violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15% of the company's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made, it didn't disclose the group's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law. 

Mr. Glazer couldn't immediately be reached to comment.
But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group's filing procedures, the Rochester, N.Y., investor said "we complied with every law," and he denied any wrongdoing. 

The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson, or seek representation on the company's board.
Harley has said it doesn't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party. 

British Airways PLC, a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp., washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of United Airlines. 

Specifically, the British carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for UAL.
In addition, British Air officially withdrew its support for the previous $300-a-share bid in a terse statement that said "the original deal is closed." 

Company officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group, which also includes UAL's management and pilot union, failed to obtain financing for the $6.79 billion transaction. 

The carrier stopped short of saying it wouldn't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for UAL. However, company officials said they plan to take "no initiatives" to resurrect the transaction, and "aren't aware" of any restructured bid in the making. 

Collectively, the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground.
The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday, with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place. 

However, in response to the British Air decision, United's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out.
Pilot union Chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky said advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL's board "at the earliest time possible." Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air's participation. 

UAL declined to comment on British Air's statement.
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who is leading the management end of the buy-out, hasn't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal. 

In another setback yesterday, United's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws.
In an effort to derail the buy-out, the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Transportation Department and Labor Department. 

But there was one bright spot yesterday.
The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake.
The pilot union, the only one to support the buy-out thus far, said the flight attendants' decision "enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable." 

Still, without the assurance of British Airways' financial backing, it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid, especially since British Air's original investment represented 78% of the cash equity contribution for the bid. 

Under the previous plan, British Air would have received a 15% stake in UAL in exchange for a $750 million equity investment, with a 75% stake going to UAL employees and 10% to UAL management. 

British Air officials said the airline's chairman, Lord King, was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier. 

The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air's chief financial officer, Derek Stevens, who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL's stock in the past week. 

UAL stock dropped $1.625 yesterday to $190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

UAL declined to comment on British Air's statement. 

In an interview Wednesday with Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, Mr. Stevens said, "We're in no way committed to a deal going through at all.
We're not rushing into anything.
We don't want to be party to a second rejection." 

Indeed, British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment.
The original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution. 

The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts. "The {buy-out} consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing," a British Air spokesman said. 

British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest's Airlines' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier.
Most of the department's statements since the Northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers. 

Even before British Air's announcement, pilot union leaders had been meeting in Chicago yesterday to consider their options.
The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union's advisers, Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind Wharton & Garrison.
They also unanimously re-elected Mr. Dubinsky, the union chairman who has led the pilots' 2 1/2-year fight to take control of the airline. 

UAL's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid.
They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction.
The buy-out fell through after Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., the lead banks in the transaction, failed to obtain $7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan. 

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and BanPonce Corp. -- agreed to merge in a transaction valued at $324 million. 

Under the agreement, BanPonce stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash.
In each case, the exchange is valued at $56.25 a share. 

The two companies, both based in San Juan, will form a bank holding company with assets of just over $9 billion.
The holding company will be called BanPonce Corp.
The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. 

Rafael Carrion Jr., chairman of Banco Popular, will be the chairman of the holding company.
Alberto M. Paracchini, currently chairman of BanPonce, will serve as president of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary. 

Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July, in a cash and stock transaction valued at $50 a share, or about $293 million.
BanPonce reacted cooly at first, but appeared to be won over, analysts said, by Banco Popular's assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction. 

"Banco Popular just kept waiting," said Edward Thompson, a vice president and analyst at Thomson BankWatch Inc. in New York. "They got a transaction that's good for both companies." 

The two banks appear to be a good fit.
BanPonce caters to a more affluent customer, while Banco Popular has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets.
The merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in Puerto Rico. "They're often right across the street from one another," Mr. Thompson said. 

Richard Carrion, who is currently president and chief executive officer of Banco Popular, said the merger will result in a "larger and stronger locally based bank." Mr. Carrion, who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank, added: "We'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks.
It makes sense from a strategic standpoint." 

The newly merged company will have 165 branches in Puerto Rico and 27 branches outside of the island.
The banks said they don't expect the merger to face any regulatory hurdles.
Mr. Carrion said the merger should be completed in six to nine months. 

William Bennett, the White House drug-policy director, accused local officials in the Washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers. 

"Politics has essentially put up a roadblock" to finding sites for new federal prisons, Mr. Bennett said at a news conference called to report on his "emergency assistance program" for the capital.
Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals, he added, "we will not win the war on drugs." 

Mr. Bennett declared in April that he would make Washington a "test case" for how the Bush administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence.
The drug czar claimed that enforcement efforts are working here, "albeit at a slower and more halting pace than we would like." 

He acknowledged, however, that Washington's "drug-related murder rate is intolerably high.
The prisons are too crowded.
Drugs continue to be sold openly around schools, parks and housing projects." 

Mr. Bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington's problem.
But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state.
Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city. 

In a letter to Mr. Bennett's office, released yesterday, Washington's city administrator, Carol Thompson, complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital.
Referring to Mr. Bennett's claim that the federal government would provide $97 million in emergency federal support, Ms. Thompson wrote, "Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure." 

Of his successes in Washington, Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates.
He also noted that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has established a federal-local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than $2 million in seizures of drug dealers' assets.
The Defense Department has lent the Washington U.S. attorney 10 prosecutors, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training, he added. 

The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp. 

The University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars ($21.3 million) over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker.
It said $10 million would go to the University of Toronto. 

Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of C$866 million for Connaught, and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of C$942 million.
The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid, arguing that Connaught's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught's ownership wouldn't be transferred to foreigners. 

The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid.
It said the new agreement would "replace" the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover. "Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught, this accord would enhance research and development in Canada," said James Keffer, the university's vice president of research. 

Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville, Calif. 

In a statement, Jacques-Francois Martin, director general of Merieux, said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught.
While he didn't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university, he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies "not currently producing and marketing vaccines {who} can only promise this for some . . . years in the future." 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Connaught closed at $28.625, up $1.25. 

The Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday, a surprising choice, but given the Swedish Academy's past perversities, hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee.
In Spain, anyway, the 73-year-old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched Franco years, the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct, vivid prose, beginning with "The Family of Pascal Duarte" (1942). 

Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War, or left Spain when Franco triumphed, Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general's side, no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds, murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land.
Still, it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte, a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell: "Fate directs some men down the flower-bordered path, and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears.
The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness.
The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts." 

Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones, his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some 70 travelogues, novels, short story collections and poetry.
These days, he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books.
The man who wore out his shoes wandering around Guadalajara in 1958, describing in his travel book "Viaje a la Alcarria" how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns, now tours Spain in a Rolls-Royce. 

Of his 10 novels, "The Hive" (1951), full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run by Dona Rosa, a foul-mouthed, broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth, used to be available in English, translated by J.M. Cohen and published by Ecco Press, which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright.
Here is an excerpt: 

The lonely woman walks on in the direction of the Plaza de Alonso Martinez.
Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard.
Both are young, one twenty odd, the other thirty odd.
The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award, the younger one looks like a novelist.
It is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines: "I've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title `Teresa de Cepeda, ' and in it I've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which . . ." 

"Oh, yes.
Will you pour me a drop of water, if you don't mind?" 

"With pleasure.
I've revised it several times and I think I may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text." 

"How interesting." 

"I think so.
I don't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in, but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment . . ." 

"Rest assured, we proceed with exemplary fairness." 

"I don't doubt it for a moment.
It does not matter if one is defeated, provided the work that gets the award has unmistakable qualities.
What's so discouraging is . . ." 

In passing the window, Senorita Elvira gives them a smile -- simply out of habit. 

B.A.T Industries PLC won overwhelming shareholder approval for a defensive restructuring to fend off a #13.35 billion ($21.23 billion) takeover bid from Sir James Goldsmith. 

At a shareholders' meeting in London, the tobacco, financial-services and retailing giant said it received 99.9% approval from voting holders for plans to spin off about $6 billion in assets. 

B.A.T aims to sell such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks Fifth Avenue and float its big paper and British retailing businesses via share issues to existing holders.
Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10%, or about 153 million, of its shares and a 50% dividend increase. 

B.A.T yesterday started its share buy-back.
The company said it acquired 2.5 million shares for 785 pence ($12.48) each, or a total of #19.6 million ($31.2 million), from its broker, Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The share buy-back plan is likely to underpin B.A.T's share price. 

B.A.T said it may make more equity purchases until the close of business today, depending on market conditions, but will cease further purchases until Nov. 22, when it releases third-quarter results. 

B.A.T shares rose 29 pence to 783 pence on London's stock exchange yesterday. 

Shareholder approval sets the stage for a lengthy process of restructuring that might not be completed until next year's second half.
Before the recent tumult in global financial markets, B.A.T officials, holders and analysts had expected a substantial part of the restructuring to be complete by the end of the first half. 

"We are not in any hurry to sell" Saks, Marshall Field or B.A.T's other U.S. retail properties, said Chairman Patrick Sheehy. "This isn't a distress sale.
We are determined to get good prices." 

Company officials say the flotations of the paper and British retailing businesses are likely only after the disposals of the U.S. retailing assets. 

Meanwhile, Sir James still is pursuing efforts to gain U.S. insurance regulators' approval for a change in control of B.A.T's Farmers Group Inc. unit.
The Anglo-French financier has indicated he intends to bid again for B.A.T if he receives approval. 

After watching interest in the sport plummet for years, the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift. 

Across the country, resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers.
Some have built health spas, business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski.
And this week, the industry's efforts will go national for the first time when it unveils a $7 million advertising campaign. 

Such efforts -- unheard of only a few years ago -- are the latest attempts to revive the sagging $1.76 billion U.S. ski industry.
Since the start of the decade, lift-ticket sales have grown only 3% a year on average, compared with 16% annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s.
Last season, lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years.
By some estimates, nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s. 

Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts.
But another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers.
Skiing, after all, has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport. 

In its new ad campaign, created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc., Chicago, the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people.
One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes: senior citizens, minorities, families with children -- even a blind skier. "Ski school is great," cries out a tot, bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope. "You'll never know 'til you try," says a black skier. 

"We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff," says Kathe Dillmann, a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association, the trade group sponsoring the campaign. 

Ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety.
But the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall. "We wanted to show it's okay if you fall," says Ms. Dillmann. "Most people think if you slip, you'll wind up in a body cast." 

The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers; normally, they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities.
But in these crunch times for the ski industry, some resorts, such as the Angel Fire, Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico, have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts. 

Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business.
Since 40% of skiers are parents, many slopes are building nurseries, expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids.
Vail, Colo., now has a playland that looks like an old mining town; kids can ski through and pan for fool's gold.
For $15, they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment, with dinner, without mom and dad. 

A few years ago, parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children. "Most parents who had to go through that never came back," says Michael Shannon, president of Vail Associates Inc., which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts. 

To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors, several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies.
In one phone call, ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations, buy lift tickets, rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons.
And resorts are adding other amenities, such as pricey restaurants, health spas and vacation packages with a twist.
During Winter Carnival week, for example, visitors at Sunday River in Maine can take a hot-air balloon ride. 

"People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar," says Don Borgeson, executive director of Angel Fire, N.M.'s Chamber of Commerce. 

The ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions.
But some think that's being overly optimistic. 

For one thing, it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive: a lift ticket can cost up to $35 a day and equipment prices are rising.
And most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions.
An American Express Co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34% believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports, as opposed to 69% who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor. 

"Even if they could bring in that many new skiers, I don't know if {the industry} could handle that kind of an increase," says I. William Berry, editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah, N.Y. "Most people will come on the weekend, the slopes will be overcrowded and then these {new skiers} won't come back." 

The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area isn't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings, officials at the two major rating agencies said. 

Standard & Poor's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties, and "there are potential isolated problems," said Hyman Grossman, a managing director.
The agency is preparing a report, to be issued today, on the earthquake's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry. 

The only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan.
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing, with an eye toward a possible downgrade, the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds, long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company, Bay View Capital Corp. 

As for property and casualty insurers, Moody's said "preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers' financial condition," but it "raises concerns about potentially substantial risks" longer-term. 

"Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo," according to Moody's. 

Health Care Property Investors Inc. said it acquired three long-term care facilities and one assisted-living facility in a purchase-and-lease transaction valued at $15 million. 

The real estate investment trust said that it leased the three Florida facilities to National Health Care Affiliates Inc. of Buffalo, N.Y. 

Health Care Property holds an interest in 139 facilities in 30 states. 

Canadian steel ingot production totaled 276,334 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 14, down 5.3% from the preceding week's total of 291,890 tons, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said. 

The week's total was down 7.1% from 297,446 tons a year earlier.
A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds. 

The cumulative total in 1989 was 12,283,217 tons, up 7.5% from 11,429,243 tons a year earlier. 

Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt. 

But while the overall market improved, the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties, even as junk-bond prices rose. 

Yesterday, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it postponed a $220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp. 

And Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night. 

The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar.
Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk. 

Since last week's junk-bond market debacle, many new issues of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back, delayed or dropped.
On Wednesday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines' junk-bond offering to $71 million from $150 million.
Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's $1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction.
Last week, the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock.
Prudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions. 

"Everything is going through firehoops right now, and {Chicago & North Western} is no exception," said Mariel Clemensen, vice president, high-yield research, at Citicorp. 

Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals. 

Dan Baldwin, managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management, said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because "several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package.
If you're going to take the risk in this market, you want something extra." 

Mr. Baldwin likes the offering.
But several mutual-fund managers, nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues, said they're staying away from any junk security that isn't considered first rate for its class.
While they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good, they don't view it as the best. 

To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds, portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10% equity kicker.
The bonds are expected to have a 14 1/2% coupon rate.
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10% of the stock of CNW Corp., Chicago & North Western's parent company.
Donaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring. 

According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations, the 10% of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group, which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5% each.
That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60% stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15%. 

Despite the problems with new issues, high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary, or resell, market.
Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point. 

In the Treasury market, the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point, or $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount.
The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows.
That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower.
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2% last month, slightly lower than some economists had expected. 

But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys. 

Short-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed, with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher. 

Yesterday, the Fed executed four-day matched sales, a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system.
The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed doesn't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3/4% at which it has been hovering around during the past week.
The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans.
It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes. 

"The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively.
They are telling us that {8 3/4%} is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate," said Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC. 

Treasury Securities 

The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25/32 to yield 7.955%, compared with 100 29/32 to yield 8.032% Wednesday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9/32 to yield 7.937%, compared with 99 26/32 to yield 8.007%. 

Short-term rates rose yesterday.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56% from 7.51% Wednesday, while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57% from 7.53%. 

Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday.
The average yield on the bills was 7.35%, down from 7.61% at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21.
Yesterday's yield was the lowest since 7.22% on July 27. 

Here are details of the auction: 

Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. 

Corporate Issues 

Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities. 

Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1/4 to 1/2 point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains. 

Petrolane Gas Service's 13 1/4% debentures traded at 102, after trading around par earlier this week, and RJR's 13 1/2% subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5/8 after trading at below par earlier this week. 

Investment-grade bonds were unchanged.
Municipals 

Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market, as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector. 

Traders estimated that more than $140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers.
There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank's portfolios. 

According to market participants, the bonds were met with decent bids, but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield. 

Away from the general obligation sector, activity was modest.
Long dollar bonds were flat to up 3/8 point. 

New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was up 3/8 at 98 3/8 bid to yield about 7.32%, down 0.03 percentage point. 

The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday's massive earthquake, although traders said market participants remained cautious. 

California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $500 million to $1 billion in damages resulting from the quake, according to a state official. 

It's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve, said Cindy Katz, assistant director of California's department of finance, although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose isn't anticipated. 

Meanwhile, new issuance was slow. 

The largest sale in the competitive arena was a $55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority.
A balance of $25.8 million remained in late order-taking, according to the lead manager. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities generally ended 6/32 to 9/32 point higher, but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts. 

Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13% and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages. 

Ginnie Mae 13% securities were down about 1/4 at 109 30/32. 

If the refinancing plan clears Congress, there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities, hurting any investor paying much above par for them. 

In the current-coupon sector, a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings.
Ginnie Mae 9% securities ended at 98 6/32, up 9/32, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities were at 97 10/32, up 6/32.
The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.42% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48. 

While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve, underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable. 

Two new Remics totaling $900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday. 

Foreign Bonds 

British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. 

The Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 was down 2/32 at 111 29/32 to yield 10.09%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 19/32 to yield 12.94%. 

In Japan, the bellwether No. 111 4.6% bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72, to yield 5.32%, and in West Germany, the 7% benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02%. 

MC SHIPPING Inc., New York, declared an initial quarterly of 60 cents a share payable Nov. 15 to shares of record Oct. 30.
The announcement boosted the charter-shipping company's shares, which closed at $15.125, up $1.25 a share, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange.
The company, which went public in May, intends to pay dividends from available cash flow; the amount may vary from quarter to quarter. 

Moody's Investors Service said it lowered its rating on about $75 million of this Chatsworth, Calif., concern's convertible subordinated debentures, due 2012, to Caa from B2.
It said the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives. 

VALLEY National Corp. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on about $400 million of this bank holding company's senior debt to B2 from Ba3.
Moody's said it expects Valley National, of Phoenix, Ariz., to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio, and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets, and from high loan-loss provisions. 

Pitney Bowes Inc. directors authorized the company to seek buyers for its Wheeler Group Inc. subsidiary, a direct mail marketer of office supplies. 

Pitney Bowes said the decision was based on a long-term analysis of the compatibility of Wheeler Group's marketing business with other Pitney Bowes operations.
Pitney Bowes acquired the core of what evolved into Wheeler Group in 1979 by buying Dictaphone Corp. 

A spokeswoman wouldn't comment on whether the company had talked with any potential buyers for the New Hartford, Conn., unit, which had 1988 sales of about $75 million.
She said Wheeler Group was profitable but wouldn't give figures. 

The spokeswoman said the company doesn't have a timetable for the sale, adding that the board's decision just starts the search for a buyer. 

Separately, Pitney Bowes said third-quarter net income gained 15% to $62 million, or 78 cents a share, from $54 million, or 68 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue grew 13% to $734.8 million from $650.9 million. 

The company said the growth was led by its major operations, particularly mailing, shipping, dictating and facsimile businesses. 

Investors celebrated the second anniversary of Black Monday with a buying spree in both stocks and bonds.
But the dollar was mixed. 

Stock and bond investors were cheered by last month's encouragingly low inflation rate.
This news raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts.
Treasury-bond prices immediately rallied, setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up about 60 points in mid-afternoon, finished with a gain of 39.55 points, to 2683.20.
That brought the average's cumulative gain this week to about 114 points.
Since the 1987 crash, the industrials have soared more than 54%, and the widely watched market barometer is about 4% below its record high set earlier this month. 

The stock-market rally was led by blue-chip issues, but, unlike Monday's rebound, was broadly based.
Indeed, over-the-counter stocks, led by technology issues, outleaped the industrial average.
The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 7.52, or 1.6%, to 470.80, its highest one-day jump in points this year. 

Many takeover-related stocks rose after news that a group obtained financing commitments for the proposed buy-out of American Medical International Inc.
Among the biggest winners were brokerage-house stocks, responding to heavy trading volume. 

The government said consumer prices rose only 0.2% last month.
Economists expected twice as large an increase.
That news, plus recent signs of economic sluggishness, greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further, which in turn would be good news for stocks, investment managers say. "I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy, and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt," said Garnett L. Keith Jr., vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, one of the nation's largest institutional investors.
Fed officials probably won't drive down rates immediately, Mr. Keith said.
Despite the inflation news, several Fed officials still fear consumer-price pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed. 

But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks.
If so, that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within a month or so.
That, in turn, is expected to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rate, a benchmark rate on many corporate and consumer loans, by half a percentage point, to 10%. 

"We're not out of the woods yet by any means," said George R. Mateyo, president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co., Cleveland.
But the economy "is slowing enough to give the Federal Reserve leeway to reduce interest rates." 

But many individual investors are leery about stocks because of fresh signs of fragility in the huge junk-bond market. 

Investors also are anxious about today's "witching hour," the monthly expiration of stock-index futures and options, and options on individual stocks.
This phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session. 

In major market activity: 

Stock prices surged in heavy trading.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 198.1 million shares from 166.9 million Wednesday.
Gaining Big Board issues outnumbered decliners by 1,235 to 355. 

The dollar was mixed.
In New York late yesterday, it was at 141.70 yen, up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday.
But it fell to 1.8470 marks from 1.8485. 

When it comes to buying and selling shares, Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one. 

Every dollar's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year, the firm estimates.
That makes it the most active trader among all the nation's investment advisers, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. 

But wait a second.
Westridge Capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average. 

Westridge Capital's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing.
Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer, such as Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and match its performance. 

Institutional investors have poured $210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns.
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few "active" stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers, much less beat it. 

And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $100 of assets -- a fraction of the cost of active managers.
That's because computers do most of the work, and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs. 

But today, indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one.
Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average, they have developed "enhanced" indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points. 

"Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade, but the index money has been just sort of sitting there," says Seth M. Lynn, president of Axe Core Investors Inc., an indexer based in Tarrytown, N.Y. "Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money." Among the souped-up indexing strategies: Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks, or just a few dozen, rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies.
They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks, such as smaller companies, those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry, state or country. 

With today's computer-driven program trading techniques, index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500.
Futures and options also make it possible to build "synthetic" index funds that don't actually own a single share of stock, but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market. 

One reason for these hybrids is that indexing's rapid growth is slowing, particularly for those "plain vanilla" funds that mirror the S&P 500. "There isn't a boatload {of big investors} out there still waiting to get into indexing," says P. James Kartalia, vice president of ANB Investment Management Co., Chicago, which offers both indexing and active management services. (After tripling in size in the past five years, index funds now hold about 20% of the stock owned by pension funds.) 

A further problem is razor-thin profits.
Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing, and in some cases are just that.
To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business, big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free. "It's like getting a free toaster when you open an account," says Axe Core's Mr. Lynn. 

As a result, indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money.
And many have been successful, as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital. 

Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years, with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks, according to James Carder, the firm's president. 

Strategies vary for Westridge Capital, which has $300 million under management.
The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks, and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies. 

Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines. 

And in some months, he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all. "By their nature, our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover," Mr. Carder adds. "The more turnover, the better for our clients." 

Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund's returns.
J. Thomas Allen, president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc., agrees it's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures. "You're buying the S&P, and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it," he says. 

But some indexers make little or no use of futures, saying that these instruments present added risks for investors. "If the futures markets have a problem, then those products could have a problem," says John Zumbrunn, managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit. 

Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5/100 of a percentage point.
An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential. 

There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds.
They include: 

LIMITED RISK FUNDS: These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains.
Here a fund may promise to pay back, say, $95 of every $100 invested for a year, even if the market goes much lower.
The fund could invest $87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8% to return the guaranteed $95.
That leaves $13, which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index. 

MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS: Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks.
Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks, indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks; the portfolio will be maintained by computer, reducing both fees and, in theory, risk (because of the large number of stocks). "We see a lot of interest in those kind of things," says Frank Salerno, a vice president of Bankers Trust. "People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies." 

TILT FUNDS: This is an index fund with a bet.
Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly, some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio.
One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates; this can avoid weak sisters, but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds.
Another approach: An investor with $100 million might use $75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $25 million on a favorite group of stocks. 

SPECIALIZED FUNDS: Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals, such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa.
Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment.
Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System, for example, has about $130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25% of their work forces in the state. 

Amoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39% to $336 million, or 65 cents a share, as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year's record level. 

A charge of $80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results.
A spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible. 

In the 1988 third quarter, the Chicago-based oil company earned $552 million, or $1.07 a share.
Revenue in the latest quarter rose 12% to $6.6 billion from $5.91 billion.
Aside from the special charge, Amoco's results were in line with Wall Street estimates.
The company's stock ended at $48.375, up 25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Amoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results.
Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern.
Generally in the quarter, overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability.
The industry's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices.
Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter, some industry officials say, but they believe chemical margins could worsen. 

American Petrofina Inc., a Dallas-based integrated oil company, yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half.
Fina blamed lower chemical prices, reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns.
It said net income dropped to $15.1 million, or 98 cents a share, from $35.2 million, or $2.66 a share.
Sales rose 2.2% to $711.9 million from $696.1 million. 

Amoco's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to $134 million from $319 million.
Chemical earnings declined by one-third to $120 million last year's robust levels. 

Amoco's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of $104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of $5 million, "primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices," said Chairman Richard M. Morrow.
Amoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output, part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year. 

But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply, to $12 million from $95 million.
Higher oil prices weren't enough to offset a roughly $20 million charge related to a 10% reduction in Amoco's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses. 

For the nine months, Amoco said that net income fell to $1.29 billion from $1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded, operations produced essentially flat results.
Revenue rose 12% to $19.93 billion from $17.73 billion. 

WALL STREET, SHAKE hands with George Orwell. 

The author of the futuristic novel "1984" invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is, anything negative about the policies and practices of the state.
Wall Street hasn't gotten that far yet, but it has made a promising start. 

Its language -- call it Streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous, reassuring, and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better, safer or cheaper than they really are.
When something undeniably nasty happens, a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear, much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers. 

For example, we'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago.
Wrong.
According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market, it never happened.
In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19, 1987, was just a big blip.
Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term, New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only "a major technical correction." 

(Another much-beloved saying, however, this one in plain English, holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.
On Oct. 29, 1929 -- a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word -- the DJ industrials fell 12.8%.
In the "technical correction" of two years ago, they lost a whopping 22.6%.) 

Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock.
These people used to be called brokers, but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction, when terrified customers couldn't raise brokers on the phone.
Either way, the word "broker" is clearly out of favor. 

Of the major New York-based securities firms, only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers.
At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., they are "financial consultants." At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Prudential Bache Securities, and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., they are "account executives." At PaineWebber Inc., they are "investment executives." 

Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified, broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today's myriad financial products.
It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves, overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle, don't feel. "Its almost product de jour," grouses one account executive at Dean Witter. 

The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips, instead stressing such terms as "safe," "insured" and "guaranteed" -- even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product.
The names of some of these products don't suggest the risk involved in buying them, either. 

A case in point: "government-plus" bond funds.
What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds?
What could be better than getting a tad more income from them (the plus) than other people?
Indeed, conservative investors, many of them elderly, have poured more than $50 billion into such funds, which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds -- only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options, a gambler's game. 

When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished, look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker.
This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships, many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments.
They are still being sold, but more and more often as "direct investments" -- with all the same risks they had under the old label. 

In such cases, the game hasn't changed, only the name.
In others a familiar old name still prevails, but the underlying game has changed.
For example, "no load" mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they don't carry a frontend sales commission.
Getting out of them, however, may be a different story now. 

Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee, usually a modest one; they imposed no other fees, and many still don't.
In recent years, though, a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6% -- when an investor sells his shares.
Shouldn't they properly be called exit-load funds?
The mutual-fund industry is debating the question, but don't expect a new name while the old one is working so well. 

And don't expect anyone to change the term "blue chip," either, even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., for one, is still a favorite of widows, orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side, it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture. 

Also, blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years.
Larry Biehl, a money manager in San Mateo, Calif., blames that on the advent of program trading, in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail.
Blue chips, he says, "are now being referred to as poker chips." 

Finally, even the time-honored strategy called "value investing" no longer means what it once did.
Before the takeover mania of the '80s, it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks, especially those with shrewd management, sound fundamentals and decent prospects.
Now, says Mr. Biehl, value investing often means "looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble." To institutional investors or brokers, he adds, a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up. 

Ms. Bettner covers personal finance from The Wall Street Journal's Los Angeles bureau. 

Melvin Belli's San Francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday's earthquake. 

In the first 25 minutes after his office's telephone service was restored yesterday morning, 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self-proclaimed King of Torts. 

Mr. Belli, like many other personal-injury lawyers, suspects that the earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time.
Suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms, contractors and developers, as well as against local-government agencies. 

But lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge.
Experts on California tort law say protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad.
Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks.
The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an "act of God." 

For now, says Laurence Drivon, president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association, "the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued, or whether they have liability or not.
We still have people wandering around in a daze in San Francisco worrying about whether it's going to rain tonight." 

But that won't stop plaintiffs' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering.
In San Francisco, they argue, an earthquake was a near certainty.
Therefore, engineering firms, construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard, and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster, if negligence can be proven. 

"My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting," says Stanley Chesley, a well-known Cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer.
From what he saw on television, Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880, which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters, suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever.
He adds that "they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault." 

The flamboyant and publicity-conscious Mr. Belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the Bay Bridge and the interstate approaching it. "We won't know until the smoke clears -- but yes, we're looking into it," he says. 

Mr. Belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage.
Mr. Belli, who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night, says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse. 

Defense lawyers, perhaps understandably, say that plaintiffs' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims, though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually. "A lot of this is going to be code-related," says Ignazio J. Ruvolo, a construction law specialist at Bronson, Bronson & McKinnon, a San Francisco law firm.
Plaintiffs, he says, will argue that damaged structures weren't built to proper design standards.
But if defendants can prove that they met San Francisco's stringent building codes, "that's probably going to protect them," Mr. Ruvolo says. 

Government entities, continues Mr. Ruvolo, could be protected by the California Government Tort Liability Act.
Under the statute, agencies are provided "defenses that normally aren't available in the private sector," Mr. Ruvolo says. "The legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability." 

Built into the statute are so-called design immunities, which are likely to protect government agencies, according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert, a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation, which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge.
The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards, says Mr. Covert.
He believes those defenses might well apply to the Bay Bridge collapse.
Nevertheless, he adds, "I wouldn't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge." 

If there's going to be a race to the courthouse, it hasn't started yet.
Mr. Covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday, and Mr. Belli's courtyard was strewn with bricks.
Wednesday, Mr. Belli's staff wasn't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety.
He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid -- free of charge. 

In a news release issued by Mr. Drivon, the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims.
The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical. 

Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions. 

The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank, except for the page numbers.
Rather than printing devils, Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market.
The plunge made Shearson's market commentary instantly out of date. 

In fact, last Friday's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise, not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week.
Shearson, a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co., didn't have enough time to update its market commentary so, "We decided to kill our strategy pieces," says Jack Rivkin, the head of Shearson's research department. 

The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary, and that's why it purged its pages.
Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that "the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance." Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views. 

But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages weren't pulled because they were too bullish.
Instead, he says, "they were cautious, and that wasn't the message we wanted to deliver" on Monday. 

As Mr. Rivkin explains it, "We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market.
And by late Friday afternoon, actually after the close, we decided that was the wrong tone to take.
With the market down, we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening." 

Both before and after the Friday plunge, Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65% stocks, 20% bonds and 15% cash. 

Former Democratic fund-raiser Thomas M. Gaubert, whose savings and loan was wrested from his control by federal thrift regulators, has been granted court permission to sue the regulators. 

In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Mr. Gaubert received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses he suffered when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving, Texas. 

Mr. Gaubert, who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American, had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan.
As part of the agreement, Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued at $25 million to the assets of Independent American. 

While under the control of federal regulators, Independent American's net worth dropped from $75 million to a negative $400 million, wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution. 

Mr. Gaubert's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees. 

Earlier this week, a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert's claim for the loss of his property. "It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise . . . that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration" of Independent American, the court wrote.
Mr. Gaubert's lawyer, Abbe David Lowell of Washington, D.C., says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts. "I don't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred," Mr. Lowell says. "It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the FHLBB where there was none before." 

MAITRE'D CLAIMS in suit that restaurant fired her because she was pregnant. 

In a suit filed in state court in Manhattan, the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the former maitre'd of the chic Odeon restaurant.
The suit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $1 million, alleges that the firing of Marcia Trees Levine violated New York state's human-rights law.
Among other things, the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy. 

The suit alleges that Ms. Levine was fired after she refused to accept a lower paying, less visible job upon reaching her sixth month of pregnancy.
Ms. Levine told her employer that she was pregnant in February; a month later, the suit says, the restaurant manager told Ms. Levine that she would be demoted to his assistant because he felt customers would be uncomfortable with a pregnant maitre'd. 

Kary Moss, an attorney with the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, said, "They wanted a svelte-looking woman, and a pregnant woman is not svelte.
They told her, 'We don't hire fat people and we don't hire cripples.
And pregnant women are fat. '" Ms. Moss said Ms. Levine secretly taped many conversations with her bosses at the Odeon in which they told her she was being fired as maitre'd because she was pregnant. 

Paul H. Aloe, an attorney for Odeon owner Keith McNally, denied the allegations.
He said Ms. Levine had never been fired, although she had stopped working at the restaurant. "The Odeon made a written offer to Marcia Levine on July 10 to return to work as the maitre'd, at the same pay, same hours and with back pay accrued," he said. 

Mr. Aloe said the Odeon "has no policy against hiring pregnant people." 

LAWYERS IN Texas's biggest bank-fraud case want out in face of retrial. 

Lawyers representing five of the seven defendants in the case say their clients can no longer afford their services.
The trial of the case lasted seven months and ended in September with a hung jury. 

The defendants were indicted two years ago on charges that they conspired to defraud five thrifts of more than $130 million through a complicated scheme to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along Interstate 30, east of Dallas. 

The defense lawyers, three of whom are solo practitioners, say they can't afford to put their law practices on hold for another seven-month trial.
Some of the lawyers say they would continue to represent their clients if the government pays their tab as court-appointed lawyers. 

Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Hart of Dallas says the government will oppose any efforts to bring in a new defense team because it would delay a retrial. 

FEDERAL JUDGE ALCEE HASTINGS of Florida, facing impeachment, received an unanticipated boost yesterday.
Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) urged acquittal of the judge in a brief circulated to his Senate colleagues during closed-door deliberations.
Among other things, the brief cited insufficient evidence.
Sen. Specter was vice chairman of the impeachment trial committee that heard evidence in the Hastings case last summer.
A former prosecutor and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Specter is expected to exercise influence when the Senate votes on the impeachment today.

Union Pacific Corp. third-quarter net income fell 17%.
Excluding earnings from discontinued operations a year earlier, net fell only 2%. 

The energy, natural resources and railroad concern had net of $137.4 million, or $1.35 a share, down from $165 million, or $1.44 a share, a year earlier.
In the 1988 third quarter, profit from continuing operations totaled $140.1 million.
A year earlier, the company had profit from discontinued operations of $24.9 million from sale of a pipeline, a refinery and an interest in a second refinery. 

Revenue rose 2% to $1.58 billion from $1.54 billion. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Union Pacific jumped $1.375 to $75 a share. 

The company said its Union Pacific Railroad had a 3% profit increase, despite a 14% rise in fuel costs and a 4% drop in car loadings.
Most of the commodity traffic was off, the company said. 

Earnings from continuing operations of the Union Pacific Resources unit almost doubled, the company said.
It added that higher revenue, strong crude oil prices and higher natural gas prices offset declines in production of oil, gas and plant liquids.
In addition, the company cited cost-reduction moves and interest income. 

Earnings from Union Pacific Realty dropped 50% to $3 million.
Before good will, Overnite Transportation earnings fell 11% to $15 million, Union Pacific said. 

In the nine months, net fell 6.3% to $427.7 million, or $3.98 a share, from $456.4 million, or $4 a share, a year earlier.
Profit from continuing operations in the year-earlier period was $402.7 million.
Revenue was $4.75 billion, up 6% from $4.49 billion. 

The 1986 tax overhaul, the biggest achievement of President Reagan's second term, is beginning to fall apart, and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill. 

Real-estate executives are lobbying to ease anti-tax-shelter rules.
Charitable groups are trying to reinstate the write-off for contributions made by individuals who don't itemize their deductions.
Big auction houses want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital-gains taxes.
And heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit. 

"Everything is up for grabs," says Theodore Groom, a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies.
Adds Robert Juliano, the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses: "It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again." 

The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains, an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress.
Other fundamental "reforms" of the 1986 act have been threatened as well.
The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes.
The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts, and also to bring back income averaging for farmers, a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years. 

As part of the same bill, the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations, in what committee member Sen. David Pryor (D., Ark.) calls a "feeding frenzy" of special-interest legislating.
The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops. 

To be sure, the full Senate, facing a fast-approaching budget deadline, last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill.
But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary.
Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts, including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions. 

"There isn't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug," says Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.). "You'll see the annual unraveling of it." 

"It's back to tax-give-away time for the select few," says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania, the third-ranking Democrat in the House.
Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees, he adds, "Next year, every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen's door, on Danny Rostenkowski's door." 

Many groups aren't waiting that long.
Just last week, a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities, companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes. "It's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good," commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings. 

Even lobbyists for heavy industry, one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill, are encouraged.
The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs "creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation (write-offs) or investment credits," says Paul Huard, a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers.
Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve "competitiveness." 

In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation, groups are lobbying to make sure they aren't left off the gravy train.
Real-estate interests, for example, are protesting an omission in President Bush's capital-gains proposal: It doesn't include real-estate gains. "If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains, they certainly want to be part of it," says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates. 

In the House-passed tax bill, Mr. Thevenot got his wish; real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision.
But Sotheby's, Christie's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs.
They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment. "Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets," the letter states. 

All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates, the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions, deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others.
The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally, and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes. 

Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses, also known as passive losses, that made many tax shelters possible.
Many other tax benefits also were swept away. 

This year Congress, with prodding from President Bush, has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code.
It appears likely that, this year or next, some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted.
Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created.
The main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them. 

"The '86 act was a fluke.
They wanted reform and they got a revolution," says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison (R., Ohio). 

So, is the tax code now open game again?
Mr. Juliano thinks so.
One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School. "I'm too old to waste a weekend, but that's what I did," the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans. "These days, anything can happen." 

Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch, only a few steps from the very top of the stands.
From my orange seat, I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series. 

It was five in the afternoon, but that was Pacific time.
Back in New York the work day was already over, so I didn't have to feel guilty.
Even still, I did feel self-indulgent, and I couldn't help remembering my father's contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons. 

This ballpark, the Stick, was not a classic baseball stadium -- too symmetrical, too much bald concrete.
And it didn't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium.
But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me, liked it that they'd brought their children, found it charming that, true citizens of the state of the future, they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event. 

Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history.
The broadcasters were, after all, documenting the game, ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick.
Why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it? 

The day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history.
Long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks.
Thousands of us had paid $5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia, its historical photographs of great moments in Series past, and its instructions, in English and Spanish, for filling in the scorecard.
Pitcher=lanzador.
Homerun=jonron. 

Players ran out on the field way below, and the stands began to reverberate.
It must be a local custom, I thought, stamping feet to welcome the team.
But then the noise turned into a roar.
And no one was shouting.
No one around me was saying anything.
Because we all were busy riding a wave.
Sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall, waiting for the wipeout. 

Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on.
Then I remembered the quake of '71, which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room.
When the swaying of the building woke me up, I reasoned that a) I was in Southern California; b) the bed was moving; c) it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited.
Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened.
What should I do?
Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot.
But the lot might split into crevasses, so I had better stand on my car, which probably was wider than the average crevasse.
Fortunately, the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood. 

At the Stick, while the world shook, I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different.
If I survived, I would have achieved every journalist's highest wish.
I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment.
What was my angle?
How would I file? 

All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake's actual duration.
The rest is, of course, history.
The Stick didn't fall.
The real tragedies occurred elsewhere, as we soon found out.
But for a few minutes there, relief abounded.
A young mother found her boy, who had been out buying a hotdog.
The wall behind me was slightly deformed, but the center had held.
And most of us waited for a while for the game to start.
Then we began to file out, to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch. 

It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen.
The crowd moved in clumps, clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus.
In this way, while the Stick itself was blacked out, we kept up to date on events.
Within 15 minutes of the quake itself, I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge.
Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car.
And by then, expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon. 

Darkness fell.
But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night, with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district.
By then, our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers. 

Everyone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant.
In fact, the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience.
The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters. 

The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway.
The tape was on tv before the night was out.
Marshall McLuhan, you should have been there at that hour. 

Lufthansa AG said passenger volume climbed 5.2% for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year-earlier period. 

The West German national air carrier said cargo volume jumped 12% to 638,000 metric tons from 569,000 tons a year ago. 

Load factor, or percentage of seats filled, climbed to 67.1% from 66.6%, even though the number of flights rose 6.9% to 215,845 in the first-three quarters. 

From January through September, the distance flown by Lufthansa airplanes rose 5.6% to 266.2 million kilometers from a year earlier, the company added. 

When President Bush arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy, will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the Panamanian fiasco?
Undoubtedly Mr. Bush will be praised by some Latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention, while they privately encourage more assertive U.S. action to remove Gen. Manuel Noriega and safeguard their countries from a Sandinista onslaught. 

The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg.
It originates in a Bush administration decision not to antagonize the U.S. Congress and avoid, at all costs, being accused of meddling in the region.
The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership, which leaves Central America open to Soviet adventurism. "The {influence of the} U.S. is not being felt in Central America; Washington's decisions do not respond to a policy, and are divorced from reality," says Fernando Volio, a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister. 

The disarray of the Bush administration's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the Organization of American States to condemn categorically Gen. Noriega.
Faced with this embarrassment, U.S. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential Rio Group of South American nations, which gathered last week in Peru, would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator.
But other than a few slaps on the wrist, Gen. Noriega went unpunished by that body, too; he was not even singled out in the closing statement. 

Now Mr. Bush will come to Costa Rica and encounter Nicaraguan strongman Daniel Ortega, eager for photo opportunities with the U.S. president.
The host, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, did not invite Chile, Cuba, Panama or Haiti to the summit, which was to be restricted to democracies.
However, Mr. Ortega was included.
Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the Costa Rican press.
Even Carlos Manuel Castillo -- the presidential candidate for Mr. Arias's National Liberation Party -- made public his opposition to the presence of Nicaragua "in a democratic festivity." 

Nevertheless, the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July, a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in Tela, Honduras, to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti-Sandinista rebels.
According to officials in Washington, the State Department hoped that by pleasing President Arias, it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega's promises of democratic elections were tested next February.
However, relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business.
And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made (at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators) to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. Arias's agenda. 

Prior to this episode, Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), sensing an open field, undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America to promote an early disbanding of the rebels.
Visiting Nicaragua, he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas.
In Honduras, where the Contras are a hot political issue, he promised to help unblock some $70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington. 

Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani; Mr. Cristiani's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd's likes and dislikes.
It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S., virtually neglected by the Bush administration, ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December, long before the elections.
Fittingly, the Tela Accords were nicknamed by Hondurans "the Dodd plan." 

The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America.
On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts." There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan: The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America.
He also called on Nicaragua's neighbors to accept a "military equilibrium" guaranteed by both superpowers.
The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow's words, East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels. 

Since Mr. Shevardnadze's proposals followed discussions with Mr. Baker, speculations arose that the Bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in Central America.
This scheme would fit the Arias Plan, which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided by Washington to freely elected governments.
Furthermore, it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas. 

The sad condition of U.S. policy in Central America is best depicted by the recent end to U.S. sponsorship of Radio Costa Rica.
In 1984, the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country, flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda.
Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica, funded by the U.S. and affiliated with the Voice of America (VOA). 

A few months ago, the Bush administration decided to stop this cooperation, leaving Radio Costa Rica operating on a shoestring.
According to news reports, the abrupt termination was due to fears that VOA transmissions could interfere with the peace process.
In the meantime, Russia gave Nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter, which has been installed in the city of Esteli.
It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America.
Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default. 

The Soviet entrenchment in Nicaragua is alarming for Costa Rica, a peaceful democracy without an army.
Questioned in Washington about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail, President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action.
A poll conducted in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64% of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama, the U.S. will come to its defense.
But in the light of events in Panama, where the U.S. has such clear strategic interests, waiting for the Delta Force may prove to be a dangerous gambit. 

Mr. Daremblum is a lawyer and a columnist for La Nacion newspaper. 

Raymond Chandler, in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book, likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher.
When the champ has lost his stuff, the great mystery novelist wrote, "when he can no longer throw the high hard one, he throws his heart instead.
He throws something.
He doesn't just walk off the mound and weep." 

Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career.
His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe, the inferior "Playback" (1958), at times read almost like a parody of his previous work.
When he died in 1959, Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book, "The Poodle Springs Story," which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque. "Champ" Chandler's last pitch, apparently, was a screwball. 

Now Robert Parker, author of several best sellers featuring Spenser, a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold, has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete "The Poodle Springs Story." The result, "Poodle Springs" (Putnam's, 288 pages, $18.95) is an entertaining, easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle, full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color.
If it does not quite have Chandler's special magic -- well, at the end, neither did Chandler. 

As the book begins, a newly wed Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle (a.k.a.
Palm) Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood.
His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring, a character who also appeared in Chandler's "The Long Goodbye" and "Playback." Philip and Linda move into her mansion and can't keep their hands off each other, even in front of the Hawaiian/Japanese houseman.
But the lovebirds have a conflict.
He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye, and she wants him to live off the million dollars she's settled on him. 

That's Chandler's setup.
Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life, Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds.
The supporting lineup is solid, the patter is amusing and there's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls, the "good cop" of previous Chandler books who still doesn't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes.
The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler's prose at its most pared down.
All told, Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect. 

But there are grounds for complaint.
At one point, the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro.
More bothersome, there are several apparent anachronisms.
Contact lenses, tank tops, prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s.
A little more care in re-creating Marlowe's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable.

Reebok International Ltd. posted a 35% increase in third-quarter net income despite a slight decline in sales. 

The athletic footwear maker said net rose to $49.9 million, or 44 cents a share, from $37.1 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales declined 3% to $524.5 million from $539.4 million. 

Paul Fireman, Reebok chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our gains in earnings provide further evidence that the controls we have put in place and our sales mix are continuing to improve the company's overall profit performance." 

The company said it expects sales to improve due to a number of new products, including a "pump" basketball shoe that can be inflated to better fit the foot. 

In the first nine months, net was $140 million, or $1.23 a share, on sales of $1.44 billion. 

Separately, Reebok completed the acquisition of CML Group Inc. 's Boston Whaler unit, a builder of power boats. 

CML, Acton, Mass., had agreed to sell the unit to Reebok for about $42 million.
The agreement also called for Reebok to receive warrants to purchase 400,000 shares of CML common at $31.25 a share, exercisable at any time before July 1, 

An outside spokesman for CML said the terms were changed to a minor extent but wouldn't disclose what those changes were. 

When Walter Yetnikoff, the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records, last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio, Mr. Guber jumped at the chance. 

Within two days, he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony.
And before the week was out, Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner, Jon Peters, the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business.
Not only that, Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia's future profits and buy their company, Guber Peters Entertainment Co., for $200 million, almost 40% more than the market value of the company. 

There was just one sticking point: The two had a prior commitment.
Just seven months earlier, they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit "Batman." But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross, would empathize and let the producers go, knowing the Sony offer was "the culmination of a life's work." 

He figured wrong.
Last week, following fruitless settlement talks, Warner, now merging with Time Inc., filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters.
Sony promptly countersued, charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business.
The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides: As one Sony executive puts it, "It's World War III." 

That two successful producers who aren't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business.
And they are a very odd team in any case.
Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York.
He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees.
Mr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand's hairdresser.
Yet, they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood.
And despite their share of duds, they make movies that make money. 

That is a skill Sony badly needs -- and Warner is loath to lose. 

Although Columbia had a good summer with "Ghostbusters II" and "When Harry Met Sally," rivals such as Warner, Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office.
After five years of management turmoil, with four different studio heads, Columbia sorely needs a stable, savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits. 

Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters aren't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected.
Their stock in trade as "executive producers" is sniffing out hot properties, locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them.
Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a "Flashdance," or buy rights to a best seller such as "The Color Purple." It falls to others to do the writing, directing and producing. 

With MGM/UA's "Rainman," for instance, Messrs.
Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production, but their names still appear in big letters on the credits, and they are inevitably associated with its success.
Sometimes, as with "Batman," the pair really do make the film.
In that case, Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979, nursed the movie through a dozen scripts, and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production. 

"They're the best production talent around," says Brian De Palma, beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe's novel "Bonfire of the Vanities." On that film, which is to start shooting in a few months, "they've been very much involved, hiring talent and discussing the development of the script.
And when you're making a movie this big, you need all the help you can get," Mr. De Palma adds. "I wish they were around 24 hours a day." 

And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention.
Warner executives blame Mr. Guber's and Mr. Peters's lack of involvement in "Caddyshack II" for casting and production problems and the film's ultimate dismal failure. "We've had a few bombs," admits Mr. Peters. "But by and large this company has only been profitable." He says his company's prowess at packaging and marketing "is why we'll be good at Columbia.
We practically ran our own studio." Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two, a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing. "Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success," says Robert Bookman, an agent at Creative Artists Agency.
Mark Johnson, the producer of "Rainman," chimes in: "He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority. . . . It's no accident that they've been able to develop such successful material." 

Mr. Peters, on the other hand, has fewer fans in Hollywood, and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully.
He gets better reviews as a creative whiz, an enthusiast, an idea man.
He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did.
Barbra Streisand made him famous.
He cut her hair.
He lived with her.
He came to produce her records and her movies -- "A Star Is Born" and "The Main Event." 

Thrice married but now single, Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of "Batman." Mr. Guber, by contrast, has been married to one woman for more than 20 years.
But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences, they make the perfect "good cop, bad cop" team, Hollywood associates say. "Peter is the bright, sympathetic guy when you're doing a deal," says one agent. "If there's a problem, Peter disappears, and all of a sudden Jon shows up." 

Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way.
Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, who shepherded "Flashdance" through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie, bristle when Messrs.
Guber and Peters take credit for the film.
Says Mr. Simpson: "The script was unreadable.
We reinvented it.
We are the producers of that movie.
They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit" as executive producers. 

When Roger Birnbaum, an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s, left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio, they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop, including "Rainman" and "Batman." Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner. "I was upset with Roger, I fumpered and schmumpered," says Mr. Peters. "But he wanted to pursue his own dream, and he went." 

Still, Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was "one of the most successful I've had in Hollywood." The two "have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive, and Peter is very compulsive," adds Mr. Birnbaum, who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co. "Jon Peters will come barreling into a room, say he's got a great idea, and be gone.
Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific. . . ." 

Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey, which became "Gorillas in the Mist." He says, "Within a few weeks, we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey.
I think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas." Universal Studios was working on a competing film, but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner. 

More recently, Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers, reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner, for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes, the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest.
Messrs.
Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man's widow for months, showing her a tape of "Gorillas in the Mist" to impress her with the quality of their work.
Money helped, too.
Ultimately, they paid more than $1 million for the rights. (The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband's followers.
Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation, but it isn't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest.) 

It's hardly astonishing (given the men's track record) that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.
But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first.
Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract.
But though "people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters, it's good to have a partner, and obviously the chemistry works," says Steven Tisch, a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber. "This business isn't about personalities at the end of the day -- its about whether the ink is red or black.
In the case of Peter and Jon, the ink has been very, very black." 

Mr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago.
Recruited from New York University's MBA program, he rose within two years to head of production, overseeing such films as "The Way We Were," "Taxi Driver," "Tommy" and "Shampoo." In 1976, he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks -- later called Polygram Pictures -- where they produced such hits as as "The Deep," and "Midnight Express." 

In 1980, Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters, by then a successful producer in his own right, after the death of Mr. Bogart.
While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others, their record wasn't always so impressive.
Among their clinkers were "The Legend of Billie Jean," "VisionQuest," "Clue" and "Clan of the Cave Bear." And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates.
The studio says it stuck with them "even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner." 

Mr. Guber replies that "this is a Goliath, this Time Warner, trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time." 

Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse, but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony. "From the beginning, {they} knew we had a goal and a dream," says Mr. Guber.
On a number of occasions, he adds, he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright. "They always listened, but they never acted," Mr. Guber says. 

In 1987, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company's assets in exchange for a 28% stake in Barris Entertainment, a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman.
In July a year later, Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs.
Guber, Peters and Sugarman made a $100 million offer to buy 25% of MGM/UA.
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio, and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros. ' President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal. 

But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later.
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price.
Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter.
Last May, he sold his 24% stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co. Meanwhile, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract. 

The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind, both financially and in terms of creative freedom.
But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month: the chance, at last, to run a major studio, about $50 million in deferred compensation, up to 10% of Columbia's future cash flow, 8% of the future appreciation of Columbia's market value, and annual salaries of $2.7 million for each.
The producers' 28% share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional $50 million.
Sony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner. 

Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $42 million last year.
And earnings have been erratic.
In the the latest quarter, thanks in part to "Batman," Guber Peters earned $5.8 million, or 50 cents a share, compared to a loss of $6.8 million, or 62 cents a share, in last year's quarter.
Guber Peters stock, which traded as low as $6 a share last year, closed yesterday at $16.625. 

The two sides now are accusing each other of lying.
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise.
But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court, Mr. Ross, Warner Bros.
Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made.
Warner, in its court filings, calls it "a piece of fiction created for this litigation." 

Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different.
For one thing, according to Mr. Daly, the producers requested a release in advance.
Moreover, the old contract was about to expire, and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner wasn't as strong as it is now.
Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights, and it was "in Warner's interest to accommodate MGM/UA, Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives," Mr. Daly said in his affidavit. 

Warner obviously doesn't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia.
At the very least, Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony.
During settlement talks, for example, Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner, according to executives involved in the talks.
In any settlement, Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years, notably sequels to "Batman." 

Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner.
And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts.
The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief, they note, Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract, then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia.
In his affidavit filed yesterday, Warner's Mr. Ross indicated he isn't buying any such argument: "If Sony succeeds here, no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it's written on." 

Holiday Corp. said net income jumped 89%, partly on the strength of record operating income in its gaming division. 

Separately, the hotel and gambling giant said it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately $1.4 billion of its publicly traded debt. 

That debt is part of the $2.1 billion of Holiday debt that Bass PLC of Britain said it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August. 

Holiday said third-quarter earnings rose to $39.8 million, or $1.53 a share, from $21 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier.
Results for the quarter included $19.2 million in pretax gains from property transactions, including the sale of one Embassy Suites hotel, and $3.5 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Holiday Inn business by Bass. 

Holiday said operating income related to gaming increased 4.5% to a record $61.4 million from $58.8 million a year earlier.
The jump reflected record results in Las Vegas, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J., as well as a full quarter's results from Harrah's Del Rio in Laughlin, Nev. 

Third-quarter revenue rose 2.7% to $433.5 million from $422.1 million. 

For the nine months, earnings fell 2.9% to $99.1 million, or $3.86 a share, from $102.1 million, or $4.10 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue dropped 1.6% to $1.21 billion from $1.23 billion. 

The tender offer and consent solicitation will be made to debtholders in December.
In effect, Holiday is asking holders for permission for Bass to buy their debt. 

Holiday said Salomon Brothers Inc. has been retained to act as the dealer-manager and financial adviser in connection with the offer and solicitation.
The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices (expressed per $1,000 of principal amount) are as follows: 10 1/2% senior notes due 1994 at 101%; 11% subordinated debt due 1999 at 102%; 9 3/8% notes due 1993 at 100%; and 8 3/8% notes due 1996 at 95.25%. 

Holiday said its 15% notes due 1992 also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price to be determined by Holiday prior to the commencement of the offer.
Holiday said it intends to set the price to give noteholders approximately an 8.5% yield to the call date of Aug. 15, 

Microsoft and other software stocks surged, leading the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks to its biggest advance of the year on breathtaking volume. 

Leading the pack, Microsoft soared 3 3/4, or 4%, to a record price of 84 1/4 on 1.2 million shares.
On the other hand, Valley National tumbled 24% after reporting a sizable third-quarter loss. 

The Nasdaq composite leaped 7.52 points, or 1.6%, to 470.80.
Its largest previous rise this year came Aug. 7, when it gained 4.31. 

The OTC market's largest stocks soared as well, as the Nasdaq 100 Index jumped 10.01, or 2%, to 463.06.
The Nasdaq Financial Index rose 5.04, or 1.1%, to 460.33.
By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrials and the New York Stock Exchange Composite each rose 1.5%. 

Volume totaled 173.5 million shares, 30% above this year's average daily turnover on Nasdaq. 

Among broader Nasdaq industry groups, the utility index gained 18.11 to 761.38.
The transportation and insurance sectors each posted gains of 8.59, with the transports finishing at 486.74 and the insurers at 537.91.
The Nasdaq industrial index climbed 8.17 to 458.52, and the "other finance" index, made up of commercial banks and real estate and brokerage firms, rose 3.97 to 545.96.
The index of smaller banks improved 1.97. 

Of the 4,346 issues that changed hands, 1,435 rose and 629 fell.
Jeremiah Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter Reynolds, said both institutional and retail investors were buying.
But there was a dearth of sellers, traders said, so buyers had to bid prices up to entice them. 

"There's no pressure on OTC stocks at this point," said Mr. Mullins, who said some buyers are beginning to shop among smaller OTC issues. 

Microsoft's surge followed a report this week of substantially improved earnings for its first quarter, ended Sept. 30.
The stock was trading at 69 just two weeks ago. 

Rick Sherlund, a Goldman Sachs analyst, has raised his earnings estimates for the company twice in the past two weeks, citing improved margins.
After the earnings were announced, he raised his fiscal 1990 estimate to between $3.80 and $4 a share.
Microsoft earned $3.03 a share in fiscal 1989. 

Among other software issues, Autodesk jumped 1 1/4 to 42, Lotus Development was unchanged at 32 1/2, Novell jumped 7/8 to 30 3/4, Ashton-Tate gained 1/4 to 10 5/8, and Oracle Systems rose 3/4 to 25 3/4. 

Caere, a new software issue, surged from its offering price of 12 to close at 16 1/8.
The company also makes optical character recognition equipment.
Caere was underwritten by Alex.
Brown & Sons. 

Another recently offered Alex.
Brown issue, Rally's, surged 3 1/8 to 23.
The operator of fast-food restaurants, whose shares began trading last Friday, climbed 3 1/8 to 23 on 944,000 shares.
Its 1.7 million-share offering was priced at 15. 

Valley National's slide of 5 3/4 points to 18 1/2 on 4.2 million shares followed its report late Wednesday of a $72.2 million third-quarter loss.
In the 1988 quarter, the Phoenix, Ariz., commercial banking concern earned $18.7 million. 

Valley National said its $110 million provision for credit losses and $11 million provision for other real estate owned is related to weakness in the Arizona real estate market.
Additionally, Moody's Investors Service said it downgraded Valley National's senior debt and confirmed the company's commercial paper rating of "not prime." 

A new issue, Exabyte, surged 2 1/8 from its initial offering price to close at 12 1/8.
The offering was for about 2.8 million shares of the data storage equipment maker; more than 2.2 million shares changed hands after trading began. 

Dell Computer dropped 7/8 to 6.
The company said earnings for the year ending Jan. 28, 1990, are expected to be 25 to 35 cents a share, compared with a previous estimate of 50 to 60 cents a share. 

Nutmeg Industries lost 1 3/4 to 14.
Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., lowered its third-quarter earnings estimate for the company, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. 

A.P. Green Industries advanced 1 5/8 to 36 1/8.
East Rock Partners, which has indicated it might make a bid for the company, said A.P. Green, a refractory products maker, told the partnership it isn't for sale. 

Banc One Corp. said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from Trustcorp Inc., Toledo, Ohio, following the planned merger of Trustcorp into Society Corp., Cleveland. 

The five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about $88 million, Banc One said.
The purchase price will be established after Banc One has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets, Banc One said. 

Society Corp. already has branches in the area, and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society, according to industry sources.
The merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter. 

Japan's reserves of gold, convertible foreign currencies, and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $1.82 billion in October to $84.29 billion, the Finance Ministry said.
The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline. 

The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen-support intervention since June, when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level. 

The announcement follows a sharper $2.2 billion decline in the country's foreign reserves in September to $86.12 billion. 

Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is propelling the region toward economic integration. 

Interviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades.
But Japan's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions. 

The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion "a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine," says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp. 

In the past five years, Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in Asia to $5.57 billion.
In Thailand, for example, the government's Board of Investment approved $705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988, 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year.
Japan's commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade. 

Asia's other cash-rich countries are following Japan's lead and pumping capital into the region.
In Taiwan and South Korea, rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production.
These nations, known as Asia's "little tigers," also are contributing to Southeast Asia's integration, but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan's. 

For recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth.
But Asian nations' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now. 

Because of budget constraints in Washington, the U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region.
But it resists yielding political ground.
In the coming decade, analysts say, U.S.-Japanese relations will be tested as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region's economic behemoth. 

Japan's swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution.
In the past decade, Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export.
In the 1990s, spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen, these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world.
To capture the investment, Southeast Asian nations will move to accommodate Japanese business. 

These nations' internal decisions "will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor, largest private investor and largest lender," says Richard Drobnick, director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California's Graduate School of Business. 

Japanese money will help turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region.
But, analysts say, Asian cooperation isn't likely to parallel the European Common Market approach.
Rather, Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors, says Kent Calder, a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University.
In electronics, for example, a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan, assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia. 

"The effect will be to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone," says Goldman Sachs's Mr. Hormats. 

Countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties.
The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications.
Participants will include the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei. 

In addition, the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker, following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke. 

The Baker proposal reasserts Washington's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region. "In Asia, as in Europe, a new order is taking shape," Mr. Baker said. "The U.S., with its regional friends, must play a crucial role in designing its architecture." 

But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region.
Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries (although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia).
Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is.
While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. "There's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions" in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade. "If they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone." 

Some Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington's demand that Tokyo step up its military spending to ease the U.S. security burden in the region.
The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S.'s leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea.
Many Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence. 

"No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home," Mr. Hormats says. 

For their part, Taiwan and South Korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut. 

"They don't want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up," says Chong-sik Lee, professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania.

Reames, a maker and marketer of frozen noodles and pre-cooked pasta based in Clive, Iowa, has annual sales of about $11 million, Lancaster said. 

Program traders are fond of predicting that if they are blocked in the U.S., they will simply emigrate to foreign stock markets.
But in London and Tokyo, where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role, traders say a number of hurdles loom. 

Government officials, especially in Japan, probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the U.S. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business.
Japan is "very concerned" about the possible effects of program trading, a senior Japanese official said after the Oct. 13 stock plunge in New York. 

U.S. stock-index futures aren't even traded in Japan now.
And because of the time difference, the Japanese and the U.S. markets' trading hours don't overlap.
It all adds up to a barrier to American-style index arbitrage, the most popular form of U.S. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in New York and the price of a futures contract in Chicago based on those stocks. 

About 11.6% of all program trading by New York Stock Exchange firms in September took place in foreign markets, according to Big Board data. 

Yet it is difficult to imagine Japan racing to introduce Chicago-style stock-index futures.
Japan's Finance Ministry already is scrutinizing institutional investors' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading, said Makato Utsumi, vice minister for international finance. 

Program trading has taken off in Japan since last year's introduction of home-market stock-index futures trading on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges.
But regulators are wary.
They haven't forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec. 7, when the first bout of foreign-led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half-hour of trading, startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing.
Japan's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time. "Maybe it wasn't enough," a Finance Ministry official noted after the Dec. 7 surge.
Japan's regulators have since tightened controls on index-related stock purchases. 

Tokyo's leading program traders are the big U.S. securities houses, though the Japanese are playing catch-up.
Some U.S. firms, notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc., have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage, both for customers and for their own accounts. (Morgan Stanley last week joined a growing list of U.S. securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts.) 

Both Deryck C. Maughan, who heads Salomon in Tokyo, and John S. Wadsworth, who heads Morgan Stanley there, ascribe a good part of their firms' success in Tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated, futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients.
They don't have plans to cut back. 

"It has not been disruptive in the markets here," Mr. Maughan said. "The real difference seems to be that the cash market here . . . is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market isn't having the same impact it does in America." 

The British also are scrutinizing program trades.
Index-arbitrage trading is "something we want to watch closely," an official at London's Stock Exchange said. "We don't think there is cause for concern at the moment." 

London serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of U.S. stocks.
Market professionals said London has several attractions. 

First, the trading is done over the counter and isn't reported on either the U.S. or London stock trading tapes.
Second, it can be used to unwind positions before U.S. trading begins, but at prices pegged to the previous session's Big Board close.
In addition to the extra privacy of these trades, the transactions can often be less expensive to execute, because the parties don't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist's fee. 

Still, "Much less {index-arbitrage activity} is done over here than in the U.S." said Richard Barfield, chief investment manager at Standard Life Assurance Co., which manages about #15 billion ($23.72 billion) in United Kingdom institutional funds. 

Britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments.
A Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index option contract is traded on the London Stock Exchange's Traded Options Market.
And an FT-SE futures contract is traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
Both contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash. 

The average number of FT-SE option contracts traded on the London exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract's launch in 1984.
This year, the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118, up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984. 

But a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index-options trading was only 15% of the size of the underlying equity market, exchange officials said.
This compares with estimates that the U.S. "derivatives" market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market.

The Transportation Department, responding to pressure from safety advocates, took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles. 

The department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans, beginning with 1992 models.
It also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year.
Such belts already are required for the vehicles' front seats. 

"Today's action," Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said, "represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards." 

In September, the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front-seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars. 

The Big Three auto makers said the rule changes weren't surprising because Bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans. 

Safety advocates, including some members of Congress, have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans, which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S.
They say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars. 

They didn't have much luck during the Reagan administration. "But now, there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem," said Chuck Hurley, vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. "We're in a very different regulatory environment." Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) praised the department's actions, noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths. "We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof-crush standards," he said. 

Sen. Danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans, including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side-crash protection. 

The department's roof-crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less.
The roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle.
During the test, the roof couldn't be depressed more than five inches. 

In Detroit, a Chrysler Corp. official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks, but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year.
He said Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the Sept. 1, 1991, deadline.
Chrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars. 

John Leinonen, executive engineer of Ford Motor Co. 's auto-safety office, said Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982.
Ford began installing the rear-seat belts in trucks with its F-series Crew Cab pickups in the 1989 model year.
The new Explorer sport-utility vehicle, set for introduction next spring, will also have the rear-seat belts.
Mr. Leinonen said he expects Ford to meet the deadline easily. 

The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress hasn't lifted the ceiling on government debt. 

Until Congress acts, the government hasn't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind, the Treasury said. 

The government's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $2.80 trillion from $2.87 trillion.
Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes. 

The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $3.1 trillion, but the Senate isn't expected to act until next week at the earliest.
The Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress doesn't act by then. 

Japanese investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling $701 million, the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said. 

The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments, Fannie Mae's chairman, David O. Maxwell, said at a news conference.
He said more than 90% of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors.
The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong. 

Earlier this year, Japanese investors snapped up a similar, $570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund.
That fund was put together by Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank.
The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman, Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. 

The new, seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors.
First, they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline, and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates.
Second, they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments, reducing the administrative burden on investors. 

By addressing those problems, Mr. Maxwell said, the new funds have become "extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S." 

Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1% of the $900 billion in such instruments outstanding, and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate.
They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae's corporate debt, buying $2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year, or almost a tenth of the total amount issued. 

The Treasury said it plans to sell $30 billion in notes and bonds next week, but said the auctions will be postponed unless Congress acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling. 

Michael Basham, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, said the Treasury may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled.
Unless it can raise money in financial markets, Mr. Basham said, the federal government won't have the cash to pay off $13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on Thursday. 

Without congressional action, the Treasury can't sell any new securities -- even savings bonds.
But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling, which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes, Congress is almost certain to act in time to avoid default. 

"Each day that Congress fails to act . . . will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer," Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers. "To avoid these costs, and a possible default, immediate action is imperative." 

The securities to be sold next week will raise about $10 billion in cash and redeem $20 billion in maturing notes. 

The new securities, part of the federal government's regular quarterly refunding, will consist of: 

-- $10 billion of three-year notes, to be auctioned Tuesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1992. 

-- $10 billion of 10-year notes, to be auctioned Wednesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1999. 

-- $10 billion of 30-year bonds, to be auctioned Thursday and to mature Aug. 15, 2019.
The Treasury also said it plans to sell $10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Thursday.
They will mature Dec. 21. 

None of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until Congress approves an increase in the debt ceiling, clearing the way for a formal offering, Mr. Basham said. 

The Treasury said it needs to raise $47.5 billion in the current quarter in order to end December with a $20 billion cash balance.
Auctions held in October and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $25.6 billion. 

The remaining $21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short-term Treasury bills, two-year notes in November and five-year notes in early December, the Treasury said. 

In the first three months of 1990, the Treasury estimates that it will have to raise between $45 billion and $50 billion, assuming that it decides to aim for a $10 billion cash balance at the end of March. 

PAPERS: Backe Group Inc. agreed to acquire Atlantic Publications Inc., which has 30 community papers and annual sales of $7 million.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Backe is a closely held media firm run by former CBS Inc. President John Backe. 

TV: Price Communications Corp. completed the sale of four of its TV stations to NTG Inc. for $120 million in cash and notes, retaining a 10% equity stake in the new concern.
NTG was formed by Osborn Communications Corp. and Desai Capital. 

Hudson General Corp. 's president and chief executive officer, Alan J. Stearn, resigned. 

Mr. Stearn, 46 years old, couldn't be reached for comment.
A company spokesman declined to elaborate on the departure. 

Hudson General, which provides maintenance, fueling and other services to airlines and airports, reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares. 

Mr. Stearn, who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984, will act as a consultant to Hudson General.
His duties as chief executive will be assumed by Chairman Jay B. Langner. 

New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer. 

The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire, which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company. 

New England Electric, based in Westborough, Mass., had offered $2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire, well below the $2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth.
United Illuminating is based in New Haven, Conn., and Northeast is based in Hartford, Conn.
PS of New Hampshire, Manchester, N.H., values its internal reorganization plan at about $2.2 billion. 

John Rowe, president and chief executive officer of New England Electric, said the company's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- didn't come true. "When we evaluated raising our bid, the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years, and the rewards seemed a long way out.
That got hard to take," he added. 

Mr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric.
No matter who owns PS of New Hampshire, after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation, he said. "That attracts attention . . . it was just another one of the risk factors" that led to the company's decision to withdraw from the bidding, he added. 

Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc., the financial adviser to the troubled company's equity holders, said the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process.
The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8% over seven years against around 5.5% boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials, Mr. Ross asserted. "Now the field is less cluttered," he added. 

Separately, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire.
Northeast said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court. 

PS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $3.75, off 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Lord Chilver, 63-year-old chairman of English China Clays PLC, was named a nonexecutive director of this British chemical company. 

While worry grows about big Japanese investments in the U.S., Japan's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in America's smaller business. 

For Japan, the controversial trend improves access to American markets and technology.
But for small American companies, it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help. 

Take the deal with Candela Laser Corp., a Wayland, Mass., manufacturer of high-tech medical devices, which three years ago set its sights on Japan as an export market.
Partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate Japan, tiny Candela turned to Mitsui & Co., one of Japan's largest trading companies, for investment. 

In a joint-venture deal, Mitsui guided Candela through Tokyo's bureaucratic maze.
It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions.
At last count, Candela had sold $4 million of its medical devices in Japan. 

The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high-tech medical product. "They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach," says Richard Olsen, a Candela vice president.
Indeed, for many Japanese trading companies, the favorite U.S. small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future Japanese use. 

The Japanese companies bankroll many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas, frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks won't touch.
Japanese companies have financed small and medium-sized U.S. firms for years, but in recent months, the pace has taken off. 

In the first half of 1989 alone, Japanese corporations invested $214 million in minority positions in U.S. companies, a 61% rise from the figure for all of 1987, reports Venture Economics Inc.
The Needham, Mass., concern tracks investments in new businesses.
In addition, of course, some of the Japanese investments involved outright purchase of small U.S. firms. 

Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large, highly visible U.S. corporations, such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. Only this week, it was announced that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51% stake in Rockefeller Group, which owns New York's prestigious Rockefeller Center. 

While the small deals are far less conspicuous, they add to Japanese penetration of the U.S. market.
As the deals also improve Japanese access to American technology and market knowledge, they feed American anxieties in this area, too. 

Even a low-tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company's fancy if there's a strategic fit.
Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton, Va., a small fabricator of architectural glass, was foundering under its original management.
Last year, Mitsubishi International Corp., the New York-based arm of Mitsubishi Corp., bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner, a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant. 

The deal is chiefly designed to give Mitsubishi a window on the U.S. glass industry, says Ichiro Wakui, an executive in Mitsubishi's general merchandise department in New York. "It's not just a simple investment in a small company," Mr. Wakui says. "We want to see the glass market from the inside, not the outside." 

Mitsubishi's investment in Free State is "very small . . . less than $4 million," Mr. Wakui says.
Mr. Bodner declines to comment on the arrangement. 

Trading companies such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, C. Itoh & Co. and Nissho-Iwai Corp., which make many of the Japanese investments in small U.S. concerns, have no U.S. counterpart.
These vertically integrated combines, some of which got their start in Japan's feudal period, deal globally in commodities, construction and manufacturing.
They operate ships and banks. 

"All the "sogo-shosha" are looking for new business," says Arthur Klauser, adviser to the president of Mitsui, U.S.A., using the Japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses. 

Adds Takeshi Kondo, senior vice president of C. Itoh America Inc.: "We have a great interest in making investments, particularly in new ventures." 

A host of electronics firms in California's Silicon Valley were financed with trading-company venture capital.
Profit, at least in the short term, is usually a secondary goal. "Strategic objectives, not financial return, drive many of the deals," says a Venture Economics spokesman. 

In investing on the basis of future transactions, a role often performed by merchant banks, trading companies can cut through the logjam that small-company owners often face with their local commercial banks. "It's the classic problem of the small businessman," says Malcolm Davies, managing director of Trading Alliance Corp. of New York. "People are queuing at the door to take his product but he doesn't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic.
They want assets, they want a balance sheet, which has no relation to the business a company can generate." 

Adds Mitsui's Mr. Klauser: "Unlike corporations in this country, trading companies aren't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows.
To the extent they can do this, they're quite content to get a return on investment of 1% to 2%." 

Mr. Klauser says Mitsui has 75 U.S. subsidiaries in which it holds 35% interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its U.S. affiliates in 1990.
Sales by these subsidiaries in the fiscal year ending last March were more than $17 billion.
A 1% to 2% return on $17 billion "ain't hay," Mr. Klauser says. 

Boeing Co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet. 

The discussions are still in preliminary stages, and the specific details haven't been worked out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. 

The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767, accounting for a combined 15% of the aircraft.
Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20% and 25% under the new program. 

If Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767, the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s. 

Yields on money-market mutual funds continued to slide, amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates. 

The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45% from 8.47% for the week ended Tuesday.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year. 

Average maturity of the funds' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days, the longest since early August, according to Donoghue's.
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period.
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner. 

The average maturity for funds open only to institutions, considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely, reached a high point for the year -- 33 days. 

Nevertheless, said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report, yields "may blip up again before they blip down" because of recent rises in short-term interest rates.
The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for example, rose to 8.04% from 7.90%. 

Despite recent declines in yields, investors continue to pour cash into money funds.
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $1.5 billion during the latest week, to $352.7 billion. 

Typically, money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates.
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9%.
Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar, the top-yielding fund, had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37% during the latest week, down from 9.45% a week earlier.
It invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees, which boosts its yield.
The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12%, down from 8.14%.
The 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19% from 8.22%; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53% from 8.56%. 

The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that aren't produced in "significant quantities" in the U.S., the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions. 

The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations.
Previously, watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment. 

Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches, covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications.
The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories, but turned down such treatment for other types of watches "because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands." 

Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches, including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences. 

U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president's action. 

Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $37.3 million in 1988, a relatively small share of the $1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year, according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills. 

Michael Henderson, 51-year-old group chief executive of this U.K. metals and industrial materials maker, will become chairman in May, succeeding Ian Butler, 64, who is retiring.
Mr. Butler will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director. 

Fujitsu Ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects, while computer rival NEC Corp. made a written apology for indulging in the same practice. 

Meanwhile, business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers, and fretted about the broader statement the companies' actions make about Japanese cutthroat pricing. 

Fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a U.S. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years.
The company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10,000 yen, or about $70, for another contract. 

But Fujitsu, Japan's No. 1 computer maker, isn't alone.
NEC, one of its largest domestic competitors, said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987.
In both cases, NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu, which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery.
All the contracts were for computer-system-design contracts and involved no hardware or software. 

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies to "make sure they understood" the concern about such practices, according to a government spokesman. "These cases lead to the loss of the firms' social and international credibility," a ministry statement said. 

Japan's Fair Trade Commission has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust-law violations. 

"We would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble," Fujitsu President Takuma Yamamoto, read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company's downtown headquarters.
The bids, he added, were "contrary to common sense." 

NEC released a statement saying, "We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society," a form of apology common in Japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations. 

Japanese companies have long had a reputation for sacrificing short-term profits to make a sale that may have long-term benefits.
But the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here -- such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs -- are coming under close ethical scrutiny. 

The fire is also fueled by growing international interest in Japanese behavior.
So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue.
But in one of the auctions in question, International Business Machines Corp. made a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer, according to the municipality.
The low-ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate. 

Foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in Japan, in part because Japanese companies unfairly undercut them.
The U.S. government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make. 

Asked whether the bidding flap would hurt U.S.-Japan relations, Mr. Yamamoto said, "this will be a minus factor." 

The "one-yen" controversy first came to a head last week when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks.
The city had expected to pay about 11 million yen ($77,000), but Fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free. 

Then Wednesday, Fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in Nagano prefecture two weeks earlier.
It also said that in July, it bid 10,000 yen to design a system for the Saitama prefectural library, and two years ago, it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for Wakayama prefecture. 

The company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano.
The municipalities said they haven't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts. 

Fujitsu and NEC said they were still investigating, and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge.
Mr. Yamamoto insisted that headquarters hadn't approved the bids, and that he didn't know about most of the cases until Wednesday. 

Other major Japanese computer companies contacted yesterday said they have never made such bids. 

"One yen is not ethical," Michio Sasaki, an official at Keidanren, the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, said. "Profit may be low, but at least costs should be covered." 

Consolidated Rail Corp. said it would spend more than $30 million on 1,000 enclosed railcars for transporting autos. 

The multilevel railcars, scheduled for delivery in 1990, will be made by Thrall Manufacturing Co., a Chicago Heights, Ill., division of closely held Duchossois Industries Inc., Elmhurst, Ill.
This year, the railroad holding company acquired 850 such railcars. 

When Warren Winiarski, proprietor of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley, announced a $75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall, few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked. "This is the peak of my wine-making experience," Mr. Winiarski declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New York, "and I wanted to single it out as such." 

It is in my estimation the best wine Stag's Leap has produced, and with fewer than 700 cases available, it is sure to sell quickly.
The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon, but it is not the highest.
Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $100 a bottle. 

One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production, of exceptional quality (or so perceived, at any rate), and with exceedingly high prices.
For years, this group included a stable of classics -- Bordeaux first growths (Lafite-Rothschild, Latour, Haut-Brion, Petrus), Grand Cru Burgundies (Romanee-Conti and La Tache) deluxe Champagnes (Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal), rarefied sweet wines (Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany, and Biondi-Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany).
These first magnitude wines ranged in price from $40 to $125 a bottle. 

In the last year or so, however, this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members.
The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition, and it almost seems that there's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle, among current releases from every major wine region on the globe. 

France can boast the lion's share of high-priced bottles.
Bordeaux's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $60 to $80 each (except for the smallest in terms of production, Chateau Petrus, which costs around $250!).
These prices seem rather modest, however, in light of other French wines from current vintages.
Chateau Yquem, the leading Sauternes, now goes for well over $100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $179. 

In Champagne, some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $100 a bottle.
The first Champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs.
The '82 Salon is $115.
Roederer Cristal at $90 a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level.
The great reds of the Rhone Valley have soared in price as well.
E. Guigal's 1982 Cote Rotie La Landonne, for example, is $120. 

None of France's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy, however.
The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world, have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now.
With the 1985 vintage, they soared higher: La Tache, $195; Richebourg, $180; Romanee-Conti, $225.
Another small Burgundy estate, Coche-Dury, has just offered its 1987 Corton-Charlemagne for $155. 

From Italy there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $125 a bottle, Piero Antinori's La Solaia, a $90 Cabernet from Tuscany, and Biondi-Santi Brunello at $98.
Spain's Vega Secilia Unico 1979 (released only in its 10th year) is $70, as is Australia's Grange Hermitage 1982. 

"There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices," says Larry Shapiro of Marty's, one of the largest wine shops in Dallas. "What's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out.
We're seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce." 

Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines, Mr. Shapiro continued: "We've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s, which go for $300 to $400 a bottle.
Some of the newer wines, even at $90 to $100 a bottle or so, almost offer a bargain." 

Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek.
It's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly (the last was 1979) and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987.
Owner Al Brownstein originally planned to sell it for $60 a bottle, but when a retailer in Southern California asked, "Is that wholesale or retail?" he re-thought the matter.
Offering the wine at roughly $65 a bottle wholesale ($100 retail), he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers: 1) no, the wine is too high (2 responses); 2) yes, it's high but I'll take it (2 responses); 3) I'll take all I can get (58 responses).
The wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12, but even at that it was spread thin, going to 62 retailers in 28 states. 

"We thought it was awfully expensive," said Sterling Pratt, wine director at Schaefer's in Skokie, Ill., one of the top stores in suburban Chicago, "but there are people out there with very different opinions of value.
We got our two six-packs -- and they're gone." 

Mr. Pratt remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers don't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on.
Even if there is consumer resistance at first, a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move. "There may be sticker-shock reaction initially," said Mr. Pratt, "but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell, they eventually get excited and decide it's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection." 

"It's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people," added Larry Shapiro. "They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace {one of Diamond Creek's Cabernets} or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet, or the Petrus.
Producers have seen this market opening up and they're now creating wines that appeal to these people." 

That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly.
But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. "They won't buy if the quality is not there," said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans. "Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less." Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines (like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $32) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $30 to $40 range. 

Image has, of course, a great deal to do with what sells and what doesn't, and it can't be forced.
Wine merchants can't keep Roederer Cristal in stock, but they have to push Salon le Mesnil, even lowering the price from $115 to $90.
It's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine, but, as Mr. Pratt noted, people have their own ideas about value. 

It's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines aren't always walking out the door.
In every major market in the U.S., for instance, you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg, virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux (except Petrus), as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and, at the moment, the Stag's Leap 1985 Cask 23. 

With the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach, it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare.
By January it should be fairly clear what's hot -- and what's not.

The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants. 

Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's.
But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions. 

James Mason, assistant secretary for health, said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research "should be continued indefinitely." He said the ban won't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that doesn't involve transplants. 

Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason's ruling, which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health.
Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion, as does President Bush, except in cases where a woman's life is threatened. 

The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health, aware of the policy implications of its research, asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease.
The department placed a moratorium on the research, pending a review of scientific, legal and ethical issues. 

A majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions, but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding.
The dispute has hampered the administration's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control. 

Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants.
Antonio Novello, whom Mr. Bush nominated to serve as surgeon general, reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion.
Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. 

Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts.
Earlier this week, Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by "standards of scientific and administrative excellence," not politics. 

But the administration's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists. "When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground, there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications," says Myron Genel, associate dean of the Yale Medical School. "The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized, so that no mechanism exists" for finding a middle ground. 

Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants.
But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason's ruling may discourage private funding. "The unavailability of federal funds, and the climate in which the decision was made, certainly don't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support," he said. 

Despite the flap over transplants, federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts. "Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer" or to regulate genes that cause Down's syndrome, the leading cause of mental retardation, according to an NIH summary.
The NIH currently spends about $8 million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $8 billion. 

GOODY PRODUCTS Inc. cut its quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 11.5 cents a share.
The reduced dividend is payable Jan. 2 to stock of record Dec. 15.
The Kearny, N.J.-based maker of hair accessories and other cosmetic products said it cut the dividend due to its third-quarter loss of $992,000, or 15 cents a share.
In the year-ago quarter, the company reported net income of $1.9 million, or 29 cents a share.
The company also adopted an anti-takeover plan. 

In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off, the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September. 

Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month.
Its index inched up to 47.6% in October from 46% in September.
Any reading below 50% suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining. 

The purchasing managers, however, also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline. 

Factories booked $236.74 billion in orders in September, nearly the same as the $236.79 billion in August, the Commerce Department said.
If not for a 59.6% surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors, factory orders would have fallen 2.1%. 

In a separate report, the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $415.6 billion, not significantly different from the $415.8 billion reported for August.
Private construction spending was down, but government building activity was up.
The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns, but weren't adjusted for inflation. 

Kenneth Mayland, economist for Society Corp., a Cleveland bank, said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off.
At the same time, the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry. 

"What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack?" he asked. "I draw a blank." 

By most measures, the nation's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all.
Factory payrolls fell in September.
So did the Federal Reserve Board's industrial-production index. 

Yet many economists aren't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession.
They cite a lack of "imbalances" that provide early warning signals of a downturn. 

Inventories are closely watched for such clues, for instance.
Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession.
But yesterday's factory orders report had good news on that front: it said factory inventories fell 0.1% in September, the first decline since February 1987. 

"This conforms to the `soft landing' scenario," said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. "I don't see any signs that inventories are excessive." A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession. 

The department said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3% in September to $109.73 billion after climbing 0.9% the month before.
Orders for durable goods were up 0.2% to $127.03 billion after rising 3.9% the month before.
The department previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell 0.1% in September. 

Factory shipments fell 1.6% to $234.4 billion after rising 5.4% in August.
Shipments have been relatively level since January, the Commerce Department noted. 

Manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5% in September to $497.34 billion, helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector.
Excluding these orders, backlogs declined 0.3%. 

In its construction spending report, the Commerce Department said residential construction, which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending, was off 0.9% in September to an annual rate of $191.9 billion.
David Berson, economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes, but probably not until early next year. 

Spending on private, nonresidential construction was off 2.6% to an annual rate of $99.1 billion with no sector showing strength.
Government construction spending rose 4.3% to $88 billion. 

After adjusting for inflation, the Commerce Department said construction spending didn't change in September. 

For the first nine months of the year, total construction spending ran about 2% above last year's level. 

The government's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGraw-Hill Inc. 's F.W. Dodge Group.
Dodge reported an 8% increase in construction contracts awarded in September.
The goverment counts money as it is spent; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded.
The government includes money spent on residential renovation; Dodge doesn't. 

Although the purchasing managers' index continues to indicate a slowing economy, it isn't signaling an imminent recession, said Robert Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., Stamford, Conn.
He said the index would have to be in the low 40% range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession. 

The report offered new evidence that the nation's export growth, though still continuing, may be slowing.
Only 19% of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October, down from 27% in September.
And 8% said export orders were down last month, compared with 6% the month before. 

The purhasing managers' report also added evidence that inflation is under control.
For the fifth consecutive month, purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell.
The decline was even steeper than in September. 

They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months.
Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating.
When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen, prices tend to rise. 

The purchasing managers' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives.
Each of the survey's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening. 

For the first time, the October survey polled members on imports.
It found that of the 73% who import, 10% said they imported more in October and 12% said they imported less than the previous month.
While acknowledging one month's figures don't prove a trend, Mr. Bretz said, "It does lead you to suspect imports are going down, or at least not increasing that much." 

Items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen, but they included one newcomer: milk and milk powder. "It's an odd thing to put on the list," Mr. Bretz noted.
He said that for the second month in a row, food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk.
They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk, coupled with very low import quotas.

The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer, Seymour Cray. 

Not only is development of the new company's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray, so is its balance sheet.
Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped. 

The documents also said that although the 64-year-old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years, the Cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype.
Moreover, there have been no orders for the Cray-3 so far, though the company says it is talking with several prospects. 

While many of the risks were anticipated when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May, the strings it attached to the financing hadn't been made public until yesterday. 

"We didn't have much of a choice," Cray Computer's chief financial officer, Gregory Barnum, said in an interview. "The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3, and without him it could not be completed.
Cray Research did not want to fund a project that did not include Seymour." 

The documents also said that Cray Computer anticipates needing perhaps another $120 million in financing beginning next September.
But Mr. Barnum called that "a worst-case" scenario. 

The filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump $2.875 yesterday to close at $38 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research's decision to link its $98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company. "It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor," said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc., Minneapolis. "Cray Computer will be a concept stock," he said. "You either believe Seymour can do it again or you don't." 

Besides the designer's age, other risk factors for Mr. Cray's new company include the Cray-3's tricky, unproven chip technology.
The SEC documents describe those chips, which are made of gallium arsenide, as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment.
In addition, the Cray-3 will contain 16 processors -- twice as many as the largest current supercomputer. 

Cray Computer also will face intense competition, not only from Cray Research, which has about 60% of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C-90 machine, a direct competitor with the Cray-3, in 1991.
The spinoff also will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan's Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. 

The new company said it believes there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $15 million and $30 million -- presumably the Cray-3 price range. 

Under terms of the spinoff, Cray Research stockholders are to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks.
No price for the new shares has been set.
Instead, the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide.
Cray Computer has applied to trade on Nasdaq. 

Analysts calculate Cray Computer's initial book value at about $4.75 a share.
Along with the note, Cray Research is transferring about $53 million in assets, primarily those related to the Cray-3 development, which has been a drain on Cray Research's earnings. 

Pro-forma balance sheets clearly show why Cray Research favored the spinoff.
Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses, the company would have been able to report a profit of $19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $5.9 million it posted.
On the other hand, had it existed then, Cray Computer would have incurred a $20.5 million loss. 

Mr. Cray, who couldn't be reached for comment, will work for the new Colorado Springs, Colo., company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement he had with Cray Research.
Regarded as the father of the supercomputer, Mr. Cray was paid $600,000 at Cray Research last year.
At Cray Computer, he will be paid $240,000. 

Besides Messrs.
Cray and Barnum, other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport, 47, president and chief executive officer; Joseph M. Blanchard, 37, vice president, engineering; Malcolm A. Hammerton, 40, vice president, software; and Douglas R. Wheeland, 45, vice president, hardware.
All came from Cray Research. 

Cray Computer, which currently employs 241 people, said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990. 

A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago, researchers reported. 

The asbestos fiber, crocidolite, is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs, with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later, researchers said.
Lorillard Inc., the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes, stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956. 

Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago, the latest results appear in today's New England Journal of Medicine, a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem. 

A Lorillard spokewoman said, "This is an old story.
We're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties.
There is no asbestos in our products now." 

Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes. "We have no useful information on whether users are at risk," said James A. Talcott of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University. 

The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in "very modest amounts" in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956.
From 1953 to 1955, 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold, the company said. 

Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance, 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number.
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases, including three with recently diagnosed cancer.
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected, the researchers said. 

"The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases," said Dr. Talcott. 

The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton, Mass., paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries, he said.
The plant, which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co., was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters. 

The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos, chrysotile, found in most schools and other buildings, Dr. Talcott said. 

The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that doesn't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth, needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles, according to Brooke T. Mossman, a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine.
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body, Dr. Mossman explained. 

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos.
By 1997, almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed. 

About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s.
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used.
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin, poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters.
Workers described "clouds of blue dust" that hung over parts of the factory, even though exhaust fans ventilated the area. 

"There's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases," said Darrell Phillips, vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose. "But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago.
It has no bearing on our work force today."

The National Association of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory organization for the over-the-counter securities markets, disciplined a number of firms and individuals for alleged violations of industry rules. 

Two firms were expelled from the NASD, three were suspended or barred and nine were fined. 

First Securities Group of California and a principal of the firm, Louis Fernando Vargas of Marina del Rey, Calif., were jointly fined $15,000 and expelled for alleged violations of reporting requirements on securities sales.
Also, Mr. Vargas was barred from association with any NASD member.
Neither First Securities, of Beverly Hills, nor Mr. Vargas could be reached for comment.
A telephone-information operator had no listing for either party. 

J.L. Henry & Co., Miami, and a principal of the firm, Henry I. Otero of Miami, were jointly fined $30,000 and expelled, for alleged improper use of a customer's funds, among other things.
Also, Mr. Otero was barred from association with any NASD member.
J.L. Henry hasn't any Miami telephone listing, an operator said.
Mr. Otero, who apparently has an unpublished number, also couldn't be reached. 

Biscayne Securities Corp., of Lauderhill, Fla., and a principal of the firm, Alvin Rosenblum of Plantation, Fla., were jointly fined $20,000 and given 10-day suspensions for allegedly selling securities at unfair prices.
Biscayne hasn't any telephone listing, an operator said.
Mr. Rosenblum, who apparently has an unpublished phone number, also couldn't be reached. 

Triton Securities, of Danville, Calif., and a principal of the firm, Delwin George Chase, also of Danville, were jointly fined $10,000 and given 30-day suspensions as part of a settlement.
While neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing, Triton and Mr. Chase consented to findings of violations in connection with limited-partnership sales.
Officials of Triton couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Chase didn't return a telephone call to his office.
Crane & Co. Securities Inc., of Mount Clemens, Mich., and its president, Glenn R. Crane, of Sterling Heights, Mich., consented to a joint fine of $10,000.
Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, they consented to findings of violations of escrow and record-keeping rules.
Mr. Crane didn't return a call seeking comment. 

First Commonwealth Securities Corp., of New Orleans, and its president, Kenneth J. Canepa, also of New Orleans, consented to a $10,000 fine.
Also, Mr. Canepa received a two-week suspension "in a principal capacity." Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, they consented to findings that they had inaccurately represented the firm's net capital, maintained inaccurate books and records, and made other violations.
Mr. Canepa confirmed he had consented to the sanctions but declined to comment further. 

Weatherly Securities Corp., New York, and three of its principals -- Dell Eugene Keehn and William Northy Prater Jr., both of Mercer Island, Wash., and Thomas Albert McFall, of Red Bank, N.J. -- consented to a fine of $20,000.
Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, they consented to findings that they failed to return funds owed to customers in connection with a limited-partnership offering. 

Reached at his office, Mr. McFall, currently chairman, said, "An implication that we failed to return investor funds is inappropriate and inaccurate." He described the situation as "an escrow problem, a timing issue," which he said was rapidly rectified, with no losses to customers. 

W.N. Whelen & Co., of Georgetown, Del., and its president, William N. Whelen Jr., also of Georgetown, were barred from transacting principal trades for 90 days and were jointly fined $15,000.
The firm and Mr. Whelen allegedly sold securities to the public at unfair prices, among other alleged violations. 

Mr. Whelen denied the firm had sold securities at unfair prices and suggested that the examination practices of the NASD need improvement.
The firm and the NASD differ over the meaning of markup and markdown, he added. 

Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York, which is 62%-owned by American Express Co., consented to a $10,000 fine.
Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the firm consented to findings that it failed to respond "in a timely manner" to the NASD's requests for information in connection with a customer complaint.
A Shearson spokesman had no comment. 

The following individuals were fined as indicated and barred from association with NASD members, or, where noted, suspended.
Except where noted, none of these people could be reached for comment or had any comment. 

Andrew Derel Adams, Killeen, Texas, fined $15,000; John Francis Angier Jr., Reddington Shores, Fla., $15,000; Mark Anthony, Arlington Heights, Ill., $10,000 and 30-day suspension; William Stirlen, Arlington Heights, Ill., $7,500 and 30-day suspension; Fred W. Bonnell, Boulder, Colo., $2,500 and six-month suspension; Michael J. Boorse, Horsham, Pa.; David Chiodo, Dallas, $5,000, barred as a principal; Camille Chafic Cotran, London, $25,000; John William Curry, fined $5,000, ordered to disgorge $30,000, one-year suspension.
John William Davis, Colonsville, Miss., fined $200,000; Jeffrey Gerard Dompierre, Valrico, Fla., $5,000 and 10-day suspension; Eugene Michael Felten, La Canada, Calif., fined $25,000, ordered to disgorge $16,072 and suspended one year; Marion Stewart Spitler, La Canada, fined $15,000, ordered to disgorge $18,444 and suspended six months. 

Mr. Felten said, "We got what amounted to a parking ticket, and by complaining about it, we ended up with a sizable fine and suspension." The matter "didn't involve anybody's securities transactions," he added. 

Victor Stanley Fishman, Longwood, Fla., fined $25,000; William Harold Floyd, Houston, $100,000; Michael Anthony Houston, Bronx, N.Y., $15,000; Amin Jalaalwalikraam, Glenham, N.Y., $60,000; Richard F. Knapp, London, $10,000 and 30-day suspension; Deborah Renee Martin, St. Louis, $15,000; Joseph Francis Muscolina Jr., Palisades Park, N.J., $15,000; Robert C. Najarian, Brooklyn Park, Minn., $15,000; Edward Robert Norwick, Nesconset, N.Y., $30,000. 

Charles D. Phipps Sr., Hermitage, Pa., fined $10,000; David Scott Rankin, Lake St. Louis, Mo., $15,000; Leigh A. Sanderoff, Gaithersburg, Md., fined $45,000, ordered to disgorge $12,252; Sandra Ann Smith, Ridgefield, N.J., $15,000; James G. Spence, Aloha, Ore., $5,000 and six-month suspension; Mona Sun, Jamaica Estates, N.Y., $60,000; William Swearingen, Minneapolis, $15,000 and six-month suspension; John Bew Wong, San Francisco, $25,000; Rabia M. Zayed, San Francisco, $50,000. 

The following were neither barred nor suspended: Stephanie Veselich Enright, Rolling Hills, Calif., fined $2,500 and ordered to disgorge $11,762; Stuart Lane Russel, Glendale, Calif., fined $2,500 and ordered to disgorge $14,821; Devon Nilson Dahl, Fountain Valley, Calif., fined $82,389.
Mr. Dahl, a registered representative in the insurance business, said he "screwed up" because he didn't realize he was breaking securities laws. "Insurance agents have been forced by their companies into becoming registered reps," he said, "but they are not providing compliance and security-type training so that we can avoid stupid mistakes." 

The following were barred or, where noted, suspended and consented to findings without admitting or denying wrongdoing: Edward L. Cole, Jackson, Miss., $10,000 fine; Rita Rae Cross, Denver, $2,500 fine and 30-day suspension; Thomas Richard Meinders, Colorado Springs, Colo., $2,000 fine, five-day suspension and eight-month suspension as a principal; Ronald A. Cutrer, Baton Rouge, La., $15,000 fine and one-month suspension; Karl Grant Hale, Midvale, Utah, $15,000 fine; Clinton P. Hayne, New Orleans, $7,500 fine and one-week suspension; Richard M. Kane, Coconut Creek, Fla., $250,000 fine; John B. Merrick, Aurora, Colo., $1,000 fine and 10-day suspension; John P. Miller, Baton Rouge, $2,000 fine and two-week suspension; Randolph K. Pace, New York, $10,000 fine and 90-day suspension; Brian D. Pitcher, New Providence, N.J., $30,000 fine; Wayne A. Russo, Bridgeville, Pa., $4,000 fine and 15-day suspension; Orville Leroy Sandberg, Aurora, Colo., $3,500 fine and 10-day suspension; Richard T. Marchese, Las Vegas, Nev., $5,000 and one-year suspension; Eric G. Monchecourt, Las Vegas, $5,000 and one-year suspension; and Robert Gerhard Smith, Carson City, Nev., two-year suspension. "I wasn't ever actively engaged in any securities activities," said Mr. Cutrer. "I never had any clients at all.
It was just a stupid mistake to get the license," he said, adding, "I'd just as soon not get into" details of the settlement. 

Furukawa Co. of Japan said it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in France formerly belonging to Dresser Industries Inc. of the U.S. 

The company said it made the purchase in order to locally produce hydraulically operated shovels. 

Last October, the company also bought a wheel-loader manufacturing plant in Heidelberg, West Germany, from Dresser. 

Furukawa said the purchase of the French and German plants together will total about 40 billion yen ($280 million). 

A seat on the Chicago Board of Trade was sold for $350,000, down $16,000 from the previous sale last Friday. 

Seats currently are quoted at $331,000, bid, and $350,000, asked. 

The record price for a full membership on the exchange is $550,000, set Aug. 31, 1987. 

Italian chemical giant Montedison S.p.
A., through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit, began its $37-a-share tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V., a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the Netherlands. 

The offer, advertised in today's editions of The Wall Street Journal, is scheduled to expire at the end of November. 

Montedison currently owns about 72% of Erbamont's common shares outstanding. 

The offer is being launched pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies. 

Investors unsettled by the stock market's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks.
That has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10%. 

But don't breathe too easy: Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices, some analysts warn. 

In the past, they say, the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over. 

That can be a trap for unwary investors, says Richard Bernstein, senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. Strong dividend growth, he says, is "the black widow of valuation" -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating. 

Stephen Boesel, president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund, explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time. "Invariably, those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments," he says. "And recessionary environments aren't hospitable to the stock market." 

Indeed, analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks.
In 1976, for example, dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index soared 10%, following much slower growth the year before.
The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976, and fell 12% in 1977 -- despite a 15% expansion in dividends that year. 

That pattern hasn't always held, but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious.
Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10% in 1988, according to Standard & Poor's Corp., and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9% and 14%.
Many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year, although a minority see double-digit gains continuing. 

Meanwhile, many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag: While dividends have risen smartly, their expansion hasn't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices.
As a result, the market's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards. 

Put another way, the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay, some market analysts say.
They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500.
The figure is currently about 3.3%, up from 3.2% before the recent market slide.
Some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3%. 

A drop below that 3% benchmark "has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued," says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price. 

In fact, "the market has always tanked.
Always.
There's never been an exception," says Gerald W. Perritt, a Chicago investment adviser and money manager, based on a review of six decades of stock-market data. 

The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3% was in the summer of 1987.
Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle. 

There have been only seven other times -- in 1929, 1933, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3% for at least two consecutive months, Mr. Perritt found.
And in each case, he says, a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year. 

Still, some market analysts say the current 3.3% reading isn't as troublesome as it might have been in years past. "It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner," says James H. Coxon, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp., the Philadelphia-based insurer. 

In particular, Mr. Coxon says, businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically.
So, while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends, they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength. 

Rather than increasing dividends, some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares, notes Steven G. Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6%.
That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so, he says. 

What will happen to dividend growth next year?
Common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth, reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits. 

PaineWebber Inc., for instance, is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5% in 1990, down from an estimated 11% this year.
In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4% to a decline of 1% , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger. 

The minority argument, meanwhile, is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken. 

Dividend growth on the order of 12% is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs.
Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures. 

One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends.
A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October, basically unchanged from 138 a year ago, S&P said Wednesday.
That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace. 

While the S&P tally doesn't measure the magnitude of dividend changes, a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year. 

In any case, opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels.
Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12% to 15% total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a "cash rate of return" of perhaps 7% or 8% if dividend growth is weak. 

But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price, who also expects 12% growth in dividends next year, doesn't think it will help the overall market all that much. "Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook, but I don't think it's a main consideration," he says.
With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year, "I wouldn't look for the market to have much upside from current levels." 

Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. posted a 62% rise in pretax profit to 5.276 billion yen ($36.9 million) in its fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 compared with 3.253 billion yen a year earlier. 

Net income more than tripled to 4.898 billion yen from 1.457 billion yen a year earlier. 

Michaels Stores Inc., which owns and operates a chain of specialty retail stores, said October sales rose 14.6% to $32.8 million from $28.6 million a year earlier. 

Sales in stores open more than one year rose 3% to $29.3 million from $28.4 million. 

"The Cosby Show" may have single-handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984, and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network. 

But some of the TV stations that bought "Cosby" reruns for record prices two years ago aren't laughing much these days.
The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows.
But the ratings are considerably below expectations, and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire. 

Meanwhile, stations are fuming because, many of them say, the show's distributor, Viacom Inc., is giving an ultimatum: Either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing "Cosby" to a competitor.
At the same time, Viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to "A Different World," a spin-off of "Cosby" whose reruns will become available in 1991. 

Viacom denies it's using pressure tactics. "We're willing to negotiate," says Dennis Gillespie, executive vice president of marketing. "We're offering this plan now because we feel it's the right time." 

But, says the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest, "I think if I tell them I need more time, they'll take `Cosby' across the street," 

Viacom's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks.
One station manager says he believes Viacom's move is a "pre-emptive strike" because the company is worried that "Cosby" ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years. "Cosby" is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. 

Mr. Gillespie at Viacom says the ratings are rising. 

And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington; Providence, R.I.; Cleveland; Raleigh, N.C.; Minneapolis, and Louisville, Ky., say they may very well not renew "Cosby." Dick Lobo, the general manager of WTVJ, the NBC-owned station in Miami, for example, says the show has "been a major disappointment to us." "At the prices we were charged, there should have been some return for the dollar.
There wasn't." 

Neil Kuvin, the general manager of WHAS, the CBS affiliate in Louisville, says "Cosby" gets the station's highest ratings and he's "pleased." But he adds, "I feel pressured, disappointed, uncomfortable and, frankly, quite angry with Viacom." 

Texas Instruments Japan Ltd., a unit of Texas Instruments Inc., said it opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices. 

The new plant, located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul, will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea, the company said. 

The plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances. 

Since chalk first touched slate, schoolchildren have wanted to know: What's on the test?
These days, students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests. 

The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders: "What is another name for the Roman numeral IX?" It also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths. 

Worksheets in a test-practice kit called Learning Materials, sold to schools across the country by Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co., contain the same questions.
In many other instances, there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials.
What's more, the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company, Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan's parent, Britain's Maxwell Communication Corp. 

Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common, some educators and researchers say.
Test-preparation booklets, software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry.
But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating. 

"If I took {these preparation booklets} into my classroom, I'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it wasn't cheating," says John Kaminski, a Traverse City, Mich., teacher who has studied test coaching.
He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests, which is to gauge learning progress. 

"It's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class, and when everybody aces the test, they say their kids are good in European history," says John Cannell, an Albuquerque, N.M., psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization, Friends for Education, which has studied standardized testing. 

Standardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade.
The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan/McGraw's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, by Houghton Mifflin Co.; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test. 

Sales figures of the test-prep materials aren't known, but their reach into schools is significant.
In Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas, educators say they are common classroom tools. 

Macmillan/McGraw says "well over 10 million" of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago, with most sales in the last five years.
About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers' binders have also been sold in the past four years.
The materials in each set reach about 90 students.
Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best-selling preparation tests. 

Michael Kean, director of marketing for CTB Macmillan/McGraw, the Macmillan/McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials, says it isn't aimed at improving test scores.
He also asserted that exact questions weren't replicated.
When referred to the questions that matched, he said it was coincidental. 

Mr. Kaminski, the schoolteacher, and William Mehrens, a Michigan State University education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials shouldn't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test.
They devised a 69-point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT. 

Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures, metric measurement of volume, or pie and bar graphs, for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum, Mr. Kaminski says, the preparation kits wouldn't replicate too many, if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures.
But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills.
Scoring High matched on 64.5. 

In CAT sections where students' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested, the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know. 

Learning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items. 

Rick Brownell, senior editor of Scoring High, says that Messrs.
Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring "the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format." He said authors of Scoring High "scrupulously avoid" replicating exact questions, but he doesn't deny that some items are similar. 

When Scoring High first came out in 1979, it was a publication of Random House.
McGraw-Hill was outraged.
In a 1985 advisory to educators, McGraw-Hill said Scoring High shouldn't be used because it represented a "parallel form" of the CAT and CTBS tests.
But in 1988, McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High, which later became part of Macmillan/McGraw.
Messrs.
Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High.

Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings-and-loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan. 

Americans today spend $15,000 like pocket change -- they don't think much about it.
But for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise. 

Your $15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit. 

As a Foster Corporate Parent, you'll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival.
Like healthy regulatory capital.
A steady deposit base.
Performing loans.
At the same time, you'll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good. 

As a Foster Corporate Parent, you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass, Lewis Ranieri, William Simon and others, who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves.
That builds confidence, self sufficiency, not to mention critical regulatory net worth. 

Don't wait -- a savings institution needs your help now! 

Every day you delay, a savings institution's health -- and the federal budget deficit -- grows worse.
Think about the good you can do for just $15,000 a month, about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university.
Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line.
Every $15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit! 

Mr. Baris is a lawyer in New York. 

Troubled NBI Inc. said it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business to focus on its software and service operations. 

The ailing company, which has reported net losses for 16 consecutive quarters, said it won't manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force. 

Altogether, NBI said it will eliminate 266 jobs at its Boulder headquarters, 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its Canadian and United Kingdom headquarters.
The company's work force will fall to about 400 people. 

Stephen G. Jerritts, president and chief executive officer, said customers weren't willing to commit to an expensive NBI hardware systems because of the company's financial troubles.
Further, he said, the company doesn't have the capital needed to build the business over the next year or two. 

"We flat ran out of financing resources," Mr. Jerritts said. "We had to do something structurally and radically different." 

As a result, he said NBI will focus on servicing its installed base of systems, trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business, using some of the applications it developed for its hardware.
The company currently offers a word-processing package for personal computers called Legend. 

The company, which recently said it lacked the profits and capital to pay dividends on its Series A convertible preferred stock, said it has hired an investment banker to help it raise additional cash. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, NBI common closed at 93 cents a share, up 31 cents. 

Rudolph Agnew, 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, was named a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerate. 

Oil production from Australia's Bass Strait fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field, the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990. 

Esso Australia Ltd., a unit of New York-based Exxon Corp., and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture. 

Esso said the Whiting field started production Tuesday.
Output will be gradually increased until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day.
The field has reserves of 21 million barrels.
Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels. 

The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected to start producing early next year, and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year.
Esso said the fields were developed after the Australian government decided in 1987 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax. 

Pick a country, any country. 

It's the latest investment craze sweeping Wall Street: a rash of new closed-end country funds, those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country. 

No fewer than 24 country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year, triple the level of all of 1988, according to Charles E. Simon & Co., a Washington-based research firm. 

The turf recently has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal.
Next week, the Philippine Fund's launch will be capped by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here. 

The next province? "Anything's possible -- how about the New Guinea Fund?" quips George Foot, a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton, Mass.
The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the "closed-end fund mania" of the 1920s, Mr. Foot says, when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular.
They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash. 

Unlike traditional open-end mutual funds, most of these one-country portfolios are the "closed-end" type, issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly. 

The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London.
These funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets. 

"People are looking to stake their claims" now before the number of available nations runs out, says Michael Porter, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York. 

Behind all the hoopla is some heavy-duty competition.
As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years, securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell.
And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it. 

Financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities.
And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets, such as the U.S. and Japan.
Country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies. 

But it doesn't take much to get burned.
Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds.
Another concern: The funds' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market.
When the stock market dropped nearly 7% Oct. 13, for instance, the Mexico Fund plunged about 18% and the Spain Fund fell 16%.
And most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash. 

What's so wild about the funds' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios.
After trading at an average discount of more than 20% in late 1987 and part of last year, country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6%.
The reason: Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold. 

It's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea, some specialists say.
But some European funds recently have skyrocketed; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120% premium.
It has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to 1992's European economic integration.
And several new funds that aren't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums. 

"I'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations," says Smith Barney's Mr. Porter. 

The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds, Mr. Porter suggests.
Unlike many U.S. investors, those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds. 

"There may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here," Mr. Porter says. 

Nonetheless, plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds.
They argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U.S.
That way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium. 

For people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds, Newgate's Mr. Foot says: "The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly." 

Copperweld Corp., a specialty steelmaker, said 445 workers at a plant in Shelby, Ohio, began a strike after the United Steelworkers Local 3057 rejected a new contract on Tuesday. 

The previous contract between Copperweld's Ohio Steel Tube division and the union expired at midnight Tuesday.
The union vote to reject the proposed pact was 230-215. 

Copperweld said it doesn't expect a protracted strike.
It said it has taken measures to continue shipments during the work stoppage. 

James L. Pate, 54-year-old executive vice president, was named a director of this oil concern, expanding the board to 14 members. 

The art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English, and, like most English peculiarities, unintelligible to the rest of the world. 

-- Dorothy L. Sayers, "The Nine Tailors" 

ASLACTON, England -- Of all scenes that evoke rural England, this is one of the loveliest: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, calling the faithful to evensong. 

The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door, as members here always have.
In the tower, five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614. 

But there is also a discordant, modern note in Aslacton, though it can't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening. 

Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells, St. Michael once had its own "band" of ringers, who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service.
Now, only one local ringer remains: 64-year-old Derek Hammond. 

The others here today live elsewhere.
They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia. 

"To ring for even one service at this tower, we have to scrape," says Mr. Hammond, a retired water-authority worker. "We've tried to train the youngsters, but they have their discos and their dances, and they just drift away." 

Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing.
History, after all, is not on his side.
According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago, nearly a third of England's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them. 

It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes.
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells, as do the carillons of continental Europe, is considered by the English to be childish, fit only for foreigners.
Change-ringing, a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago, requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration. 

Proper English bells are started off in "rounds," from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using, in larger churches, as many as 12 bells.
Then, at a signal, the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking.
Each variation, or change, can occur only once, the rules state.
Ringers memorize patterns of changes, known as "methods," which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters.
A series of 5,000 or so changes is a "peal" and takes about three hours. 

A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved.
Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle, one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter's stance, each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber.
No one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves, muffled by the ceiling.
Totally absorbed, the ringers stare straight ahead, using peripheral vision (they call it "rope-sight") to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls. 

Far above in the belfry, the huge bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing madly through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the inverted, or mouth-up position.
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing, so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change. 

In a well-known detective-story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a "passion {that} finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection." Ringers, she added, are "filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed." 

"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession," admits Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers. 

It is a passion that usually stays in the tower, however.
More often than not, ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry.
When their changes are completed, and after they have worked up a sweat, ringers often skip off to the local pub, leaving worship for others below. 

This does not sit well with some clerics.
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling, strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services.
Two years ago, the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so fed up with ringers who didn't attend service he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest. "They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises," the Vicar Hummerstone says. 

An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington, several of whom are members of the congregation.
But there still aren't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells. 

At St. Mary's Church in Ilminster, Somerset, the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance.
The vicar, W.D. Jones, refuses to talk about it, saying it would "reopen the wound." But C.J.B. Marshall, vicar of a nearby church, feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar. "So crunch, crunch, crunch, bang, bang, bang -- here come the ringers from above, making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer," he says. 

Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue, since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself. "The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church," he says. "I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life." 

The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, a sort of parliament of ringing groups, aims to improve relations with vicars, says John C. Baldwin, president.
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled, "The Bells in Your Care." Says Mr. Baldwin, "We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience." 

Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem: lack of ringers.
One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, only 40,000 of them still ring.
Also, ringers don't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small, rural parishes and inner-city churches. 

But the council's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful, says Mr. Baldwin. "Right now, we're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10," he adds. 

One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are women.
They aren't accepted everywhere, however.
The oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain's most prestigious churches, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. 

This being Britain, no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit, but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to "The Ringing World," a weekly newspaper for ringers.
One writer, signing his letter as "Red-blooded, balanced male," remarked on the "frequency of women fainting in peals," and suggested that they "settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings." 

In the torrent of replies that followed, one woman ringer from Solihull observed that "the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired: badly dressed, decorated with acne and a large beer-belly, frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals." Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing, "I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.
I have seen one or two men die, bless them." 

The U.S., claiming some success in its trade diplomacy, removed South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents, copyrights and other intellectual-property rights. 

However, five other countries -- China, Thailand, India, Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced.
Under the new U.S. trade law, those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they don't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring. 

Mrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made "genuine progress" on this touchy issue.
She said there is "growing realization" around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations, and particularly the "creativity and inventiveness of an {offending} country's own citizens." 

U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there. 

Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates.
Seoul also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures to aid these teams, she said. 

Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement, amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films.
That measure could compel Taipei's growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films. 

Saudi Arabia, for its part, has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works, Mrs. Hills said. 

These three countries aren't completely off the hook, though.
They will remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other countries.
Those countries -- including Japan, Italy, Canada, Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the "priority" list. 

Gary Hoffman, a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases, said the threat of U.S. retaliation, combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country's own interest, prompted the improvements made by South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. "What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working," he said.
He said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law. 

Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about "disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia." She didn't elaborate, although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey. 

The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30.
So far, Mrs. Hills hasn't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act. 

LSI Logic Corp. reported a surprise $35.7 million third-quarter net loss, including a special restructuring charge that reflects a continuing industry-wide slowdown in semiconductor demand. 

In September, the custom-chip maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $2 million to $3 million net loss for the third quarter.
But company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $43 million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations, citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques. 

"Over the summer months, there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector, our primary market," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, chairman and chief executive officer. "In addition, recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment, at least until midyear." As a result, the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and "make appropriate reductions" in operating expenses. 

The $35.7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share.
Not counting the extraordinary charge, the company said it would have had a net loss of $3.1 million, or seven cents a share.
A year earlier, it had profit of $7.5 million, or 18 cents a share.
Revenue rose 42% to $133.7 million from $94 million. 

The charge partly reflects a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips.
Related to that decision, the company said it was converting its Santa Clara, Calif., factory to a research and development facility.
A spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force. 

"This is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned," said Michael Stark, chip analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Co. "I think the stock is dead money for a while." Yesterday's announcement was made after markets closed. 

U.S. chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer.
Part of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the U.S. economy. 

Investor Harold Simmons and NL Industries Inc. offered to acquire Georgia Gulf Corp. for $50 a share, or about $1.1 billion, stepping up the pressure on the commodity chemicals concern. 

The offer follows an earlier proposal by NL and Mr. Simmons to help Georgia Gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $55 a share.
Georgia Gulf rebuffed that offer in September and said it would study other alternatives.
However, it hasn't yet made any proposals to shareholders. 

Late yesterday, Georgia Gulf said it reviewed the NL proposal as well as interests from "third parties" regarding business combinations.
Georgia Gulf said it hasn't eliminated any alternatives and that "discussions are being held with interested parties, and work is also continuing on other various transactions." It didn't elaborate. 

Analysts saw the latest offer as proof that Mr. Simmons, an aggressive and persistent investor, won't leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed. "He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull," says Paul Leming, a vice president with Morgan Stanley & Co. "He appears to be in it for the long haul." Mr. Simmons and NL already own a 9.9% stake in Georgia Gulf. 

Mr. Simmons owns 88% of Valhi Inc., which in turn owns two-thirds of NL. NL is officially making the offer. 

Mr. Leming wasn't surprised by the lower price cited by NL, saying he believes that $55 a share is "the most you can pay for Georgia Gulf before it becomes a bad acquisition." 

Georgia Gulf stock rose $1.75 a share yesterday to close at $51.25 a share, while NL shares closed unchanged at $22.75 and Valhi rose 62.5 cents to $15, all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

J. Landis Martin, NL president and chief executive officer, said NL and Mr. Simmons cut the price they were proposing for Georgia Gulf because they initially planned a transaction that included about $250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt.
However, the junk-bond market has collapsed in recent weeks, lessening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed. 

Now, he said, the group plans to put in "several hundred million" dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt.
He also said that the group reduced its offer because it wasn't allowed to see Georgia Gulf's confidential financial information without agreeing that it wouldn't make an offer unless it had Georgia Gulf's consent. 

In a letter to Georgia Gulf President Jerry R. Satrum, Mr. Martin asked Georgia Gulf to answer its offer by Tuesday. 

It wasn't clear how NL and Mr. Simmons would respond if Georgia Gulf spurns them again.
Mr. Martin said they haven't yet decided what their next move would be, but he didn't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Georgia Gulf's board.
In other transactions, Mr. Simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer. 

Although Georgia Gulf hasn't been eager to negotiate with Mr. Simmons and NL, a specialty chemicals concern, the group apparently believes the company's management is interested in some kind of transaction.
The management group owns about 18% of the stock, most purchased at nominal prices, and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold. 

In the third quarter, Georgia Gulf earned $46.1 million, or $1.85 a share, down from $53 million, or $1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding.
Sales fell to $251.2 million from $278.7 million. 

Japan's domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses in October rose 18% from a year earlier to 500,004 units, a record for the month, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said. 

The strong growth followed year-to-year increases of 21% in August and 12% in September.
The monthly sales have been setting records every month since March. 

October sales, compared with the previous month, inched down 0.4%. 

Sales of passenger cars grew 22% from a year earlier to 361,376 units.
Sales of medium-sized cars, which benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax, more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988. 

Your Oct. 6 article "Japan's Financial Firms Lure Science Graduates" states, "Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing Japan's economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees." The Japanese industrial companies should know better.
They are barking up the wrong tree, because it is basically their fault they can't attract new employees. 

Takuma Yamamoto, president of Fujitsu Ltd., believes "the `money worship' among young people . . . caused the problem." He is just passing the buck to young people.
What's wrong with asking for more money?
Money is not everything, but it is necessary, and business is not volunteer work.
It is not unethical to choose a higher-salaried job. 

Unfortunately, Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages.
I get the impression that some Japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful.
I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers, but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them. 

Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images, but they should realize that the most important thing is real change, not changing people's perceptions. 

If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival, they could do at least three things to improve the situation: raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions; improve working conditions (better offices and more vacations, for example); accept and hire more labor from outside Japan.

Rekindled hope that two New England states will allow broader interstate banking boosted Nasdaq's bank stocks, but the over-the-counter market was up only slightly in lackluster trading. 

The Nasdaq composite index added 1.01 to 456.64 on paltry volume of 118.6 million shares.
In terms of volume, it was an inauspicious beginning for November.
Yesterday's share turnover was well below the year's daily average of 133.8 million.
In October, the busiest month of the year so far, daily volume averaged roughly 145 million shares. 

The Nasdaq 100 index of the biggest nonfinancial stocks gained 1.39 to 446.62.
The index of the 100 largest Nasdaq financial stocks rose modestly as well, gaining 1.28 to 449.04.
But the broader Nasdaq bank index, which tracks thrift issues, jumped 3.23 to 436.01. 

The bank stocks got a boost when Connecticut Bank & Trust and Bank of New England said they no longer oppose pending legislation that would permit banks from other regions to merge with Connecticut and Massachusetts banks.
The two banks merged in 1985.
Bank of New England's shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 

The stocks of banking concerns based in Massachusetts weren't helped much by the announcement, traders said, because many of those concerns have financial problems tied to their real-estate loan portfolios, making them unattractive takeover targets. 

But speculators, anticipating that Connecticut will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon, immediately bid up shares of Connecticut banks on the news. "A lot of the stocks that have been under water finally saw a reason to uptick," said George Jennison, head trader of banking issues in Shearson Lehman Hutton's OTC department. 

The biggest beneficiary was Northeast Bancorp, which surged 7 3/4 to 69.
The Stamford, Conn., concern has agreed to a buy-out by Bank of New York in a transaction with an indicated value of about $100 a share that expires next August.
Ed Macheski, a Wilton, Conn., money manager who follows bank stocks, said the announcement effectively gives the deal "the green light." 

Mr. Jennison said Northeast Bancorp also fared well because takeover stocks have returned to favor among investors.
Another OTC bank stock involved in a buy-out deal, First Constitution Financial, was higher.
It rose 7/8 to 18 1/4.
First Constitution has signed a merger agreement with WFRR L.P. and GHKM Corp., under which all of its common shares will be acquired for $25 each, or $273.5 million. 

Among other Connecticut banks whose shares trade in the OTC market, Society for Savings Bancorp, based in Hartford, saw its stock rise 1 3/4 to 18 1/4.
Centerbank added 5/8 to 8 3/4; shares of NESB, a New London-based bank holding company, rose 5/8 to 5 7/8. 

Among other banking issues, Pennview Savings Association leapt more than 44% with a gain of 6 5/8 to 21 5/8.
The Pennsylvania bank agreed to be acquired in a merger with Univest Corp. of Pennsylvania for $25.50 a share.
Valley Federal Savings & Loan, a California thrift issue, gained 1 to 4 1/4 after reporting a third-quarter loss of $70.7 million after an $89.9 million pretax charge mostly related to its mobile home financing unit. 

Dan E. Nelms, Valley Federal's president and chief executive officer, said the one-time charge substantially eliminates future losses associated with the unit.
He said the company's core business remains strong.
He also said that after the charges, and "assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates, the company expects to achieve near-record earnings in 1990." 

Weisfield's surged 6 3/4 to 55 1/2 and Ratners Group's American depositary receipts, or ADRs, gained 5/8 to 12 1/4.
The two concerns said they entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ratners will begin a tender offer for all of Weisfield's common shares for $57.50 each. 

Also on the takeover front, Jaguar's ADRs rose 1/4 to 13 7/8 on turnover of 4.4 million.
Since the British auto maker became a takeover target last month, its ADRs have jumped about 78%. 

After troubled Heritage Media proposed acquiring POP Radio in a stock swap, POP Radio's shares tumbled 4 to 14 3/4.
Heritage Media, which already owns about 51% of POP Radio, proposed paying POP Radio shareholders with shares of a new class of Heritage Media preferred stock that would be convertible into four shares of Heritage Media's common. 

Rally's lost 1 3/4 to 21 3/4.
The restaurant operator said it has redeemed its rights issued Monday under its shareholder rights plan. 

The fast-food company said its decision was based on discussions with a shareholder group, Giant Group Ltd., "in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company." 

Giant Group is led by three Rally's directors, Burt Sugarman, James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II, who earlier this month indicated they had a 42.5% stake in Rally's and planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally's nine-member board. 

SCI Systems slipped 7/8 to 10 on volume of 858,000 shares.
The Huntsville, Ala., electronic products maker said it expects to post a "significant" loss for its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30.
In the year-earlier period, SCI had net income of $4.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $225.6 million. 

This is the year the negative ad, for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns, became the main event. 

The irony is that the attack commercial, after getting a boost in last year's presidential campaign, has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country. 

But in the three leading political contests of 1989, the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility, raising fears that this kind of mudslinging, empty of significant issues, is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content. 

"Now," says Joseph Napolitan, a pioneer in political television, "the idea is to attack first, last and always." 

A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics, accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988, has reached an entirely new stage. 

"To get people's attention these days," says Douglas Bailey, a political consultant, "your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining, and, more often than not, that means confrontational.
And, unlike a few years ago, you don't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful." 

In 1989, as often as not, the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves. 

Take a look, then, at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday's elections in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia: 

New York City: The screen fills with a small, tight facial shot of David Dinkins, Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City. "David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years," says a disembodied male voice. 

And then this television commercial, paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes, the master of negative TV ads, really gets down to business.
Mr. Dinkins, the ad charges, also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately, hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper "through a phony organization with no members, no receipts and no office." 

"David Dinkins," says the kicker, "Why does he always wait until he's caught?" 

"Nasty innuendoes," says John Siegal, Mr. Dinkins's issues director, "designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply doesn't exist." 

Stung by the Giuliani ads, Mr. Dinkins's TV consultants, Robert Shrum and David Doak, finally unleashed a negative ad of their own.
The screen shows two distorted, unrecognizable photos, presumably of two politicians. "Compare two candidates for mayor," says the announcer. "One says he's for banning cop-killer bullets.
The other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets.
One claims he's pro-choice.
The other has opposed a woman's right to choose." 

"Funny thing," says the kicker, "both these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani." 

Who's telling the truth?
Everybody -- and nobody.
It's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate. 

Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years, but he insists he voluntarily admitted the "oversight" when he was being considered for a city job.
He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems, but he insists he made no secret of it.
The city's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete.
The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors.
And, says Mr. Dinkins, he didn't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping.
But, say Mr. Dinkins's managers, he did have an office and his organization did have members. 

Mr. Giuliani's campaign chairman, Peter Powers, says the Dinkins ad is "deceptive." The other side, he argues, "knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice, even though he has personal reservations.
They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets, but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation." 

Virginia: Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force.
Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag, an announcer talks about the "strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty" that Virginians have nurtured for generations.
Then, just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen, the announcer continues: "On the issue of abortion, Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians." 

That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion "even in cases of rape and incest," a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign, transforming it, at least in part, into a referendum on abortion.
The ad prompted Mr. Coleman, the former Virginia attorney general, to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad. 

The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal.
A voice says, "C'mon, now, don't you have boyfriends?" Then an announcer interjects: "It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists.
So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women, ask him about this law he tried to pass." 

Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago, but he did so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.
The legislation itself noted that it was introduced "by request," and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation. 

"People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner," says Mark Rozell, a political scientist at Mary Washington College. "Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman." 

Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning, but the truce lasted only hours.
By Tuesday night, television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder's sensitivity to rape victims. 

New Jersey: The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio's rival, Republican Rep. Jim Courter. "Remember Pinocchio?" says a female voice. "Consider Jim Courter." 

And then this commercial, produced by Bob Squier, gets down to its own mean and dirty business.
Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus, and the female voice purrs, "That hazardous waste on his {Mr.
Courter's} property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud." And the nose on Mr. Courter's face grows. 

The only fraud involved, cry Mr. Courter's partisans, is the Florio commercial itself, and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial, produced by Mr. Ailes.
In this one, the screen fills with photographs of both candidates. "Who's really lying?" asks a female voice. "Florio's lying," the voice goes on, because "the barrel on Courter's land . . . contained heating oil, was cleaned up and caused no pollution." 

Mr. Courter's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio's grows. 

Who's telling the truth?
Stephen Salmore, a political scientist at New Jersey's Eagleton Institute, says it's another example of an ad that's true but not fully accurate.
Barrels were dumped on the Courter property, a complaint was made, but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment. 

Even so, according to Mr. Salmore, the ad was "devastating" because it raised questions about Mr. Courter's credibility.
But it's building on a long tradition.
In 1966, on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor, GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying, "If you want to keep the crime rates high, O'Connor is your man." 

For 10 years, Genie Driskill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient.
A high-balance customer that banks pine for, she didn't give much thought to the rates she was receiving, nor to the fees she was paying. 

But in August, First Atlanta National Bank introduced its Crown Account, a package designed to lure customers such as Ms. Driskill.
Among other things, it included checking, safe deposit box and credit card -- all for free -- plus a good deal on installment loans.
All she had to do was put $15,000 in a certificate of deposit, or qualify for a $10,000 personal line of credit. 

"I deserve something for my loyalty," she says.
She took her business to First Atlanta. 

So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days.
For nearly a decade, banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans.
The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services. 

But many banks are turning away from strict price competition.
Instead, they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population. 

"You're dead in the water if you aren't segmenting the market," says Anne Moore, president of Synergistics Research Corp., a bank consulting firm in Atlanta. 

NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers.
The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $18,000, but throws in a special cash-flow statement to help in saving money. 

In September, Union Planters Corp. of Memphis, Tenn., launched The Edge account, a package designed for the "thirtysomething" crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees, and a full percentage point off on installment loans.
The theory: Such individuals, many with young children, are in their prime borrowing years -- and, having borrowed from the bank, they may continue to use it for other services in later years. 

For some time, banks have been aiming packages at the elderly, the demographic segment with the highest savings.
Those efforts are being stepped up.
Judie MacDonald, vice president of retail sales at Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla., says the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles. 

"Varying age, geography and life-style differences create numerous sub-markets," Ms. MacDonald says.
She says individual Barnett branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests. "An active 55-year-old in Boca Raton may care more about Senior Olympic games, while a 75-year-old in Panama City may care more about a seminar on health," she says. 

Banks have tried packaging before.
In 1973, Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account, which included free checking, a credit card, safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $3 monthly fee. 

The concept begot a slew of copycats, but the banks stopped promoting the packages.
One big reason: thin margins.
Many banks, particularly smaller ones, were slow to computerize and couldn't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable.
As banks' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s, the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs. 

But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age, income and geography.
They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s.
Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits, as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate CDs.
Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account, it began offering money-market accounts, certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking, and staggering rates based on the size of deposits. 

The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation. "Today, a banker is worrying about local, regional and money-center {banks}, as well as thrifts and credit unions," says Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research. "So people who weren't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base." 

The competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer. "The average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions," says Michael P. Sullivan, who runs his own bank consulting firm in Charlotte, N.C. "This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today's rate-sensitive customers costly." 

Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place.
For their troubles, the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate.
The more accounts customers have, Mr. Sullivan says, the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it.
That can pay off down the road as customers, especially the younger ones, change from borrowers to savers/investors. 

Packaging has some drawbacks.
The additional technology, personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive.
Chemical Bank spent more than $50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line, several packages aimed at different segments, in 1986, according to Thomas Jacob, senior vice president of marketing. "It's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive, and make it pay," Mr. Jacob says. 

Still, bankers expect packaging to flourish, primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs. "These days, banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them," Ms. Moore says.
Some banks are already moving in that direction, according to Alvin T. Sale, marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte.
First Union, he says, now has packages for seven customer groups.
Soon, it will split those into 30. 

Says Mr. Sale: "I think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store, not the boutique."

Your Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell's offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph. 

Such is hardly the case.
Bell's father-in-law, Gardner G. Hubbard, wealthy and well-connected, obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York.
This is where Bell's patents went. 

Western Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business.
It acquired Thomas Edison's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather, Emile Berliner, which had been sold to Bell for a princely $50,000, infringed upon Western Union's Edison patent.
When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison's application, Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company's current plight.

In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars, a lot of revenue-desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space.
So can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers? 

Garbage magazine, billed as "The Practical Journal for the Environment," is about to find out. 

Founded by Brooklyn, N.Y., publishing entrepreneur Patricia Poore, Garbage made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis.
The magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting, explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet, and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders. 

Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America's good guys and bad boys.
In one feature, called "In the Dumpster," editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender.
From an advertising standpoint, the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days. 

With only two issues under its belt, Garbage has alienated some would-be advertisers and raised the ire of others.
Campbell Soup, for one, is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere "In the Dumpster" column.
The magazine's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging's polystyrene foam, polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable. "It's precisely the kind of product that's created the municipal landfill monster," the editors wrote. 

"I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage, but it is practicing journalistic garbage," fumes a spokesman for Campbell Soup.
He says Campbell wasn't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment.
Modifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed, he says, making it less an offender than was portrayed.
He admits, though, it isn't one of Campbell Soup's better products in terms of recyclability. 

Campbell Soup, not surprisingly, doesn't have any plans to advertise in the magazine, according to its spokesman. 

Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue's big spenders. "You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you're going to make a run of it," says Mike White, senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham, Chicago. "The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base" of big-time ad spenders, he adds. 

The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers, including General Electric and Adolph Coors, but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International, firms that don't spend much money advertising and can't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul. 

A Waste Management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase, and it doesn't have any plans to advertise in future issues. "We don't spend much on print advertising," she says. 

But Ms. Poore, the magazine's editor and publisher, contends Garbage can survive, at least initially, on subscription revenues.
Individual copies of the magazine sell for $2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $21. (It is, of course, printed on recycled paper.) 

According to Ms. Poore, Old-House Journal Corp., her publishing company, printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue.
The first and second issues sold out on newsstands, she says, and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions. 

Asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine's direct policy, Ms. Poore replies: "I don't know and I don't care.
I'm not saying advertising revenue isn't important," she says, "but I couldn't sleep at night" if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad.

Cathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes.
While giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16, she spotted a student looking at crib sheets. 

She had seen cheating before, but these notes were uncanny. "A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance. . . . At the end of World War II, Germany surrendered before Japan. . . . The Senate-House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms." 

Virtually word for word, the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking.
In fact, the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section.
The student surrendered the notes, but not without a protest. "My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test," he said. 

The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school.
Confronted, Mrs. Yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes.
She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers. 

Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security.
In September, she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine.
Her alternative was 90 days in jail. 

Her story is partly one of personal downfall.
She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students, but she will probably never teach again.
In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer; of colleagues who say she brought them shame; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions, she became something of a local martyr. 

Mrs. Yeargin's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform, where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat.
The 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina's school-improvement laws.
Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students' scores to win a bonus under the state's 1984 Education Improvement Act.
The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student-test scores. 

"There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores," says Walt Haney, an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College. "So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise." And most disturbing, it is educators, not students, who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing. 

A 50-state study released in September by Friends for Education, an Albuquerque, N.M., school-research group, concluded that "outright cheating by American educators" is "common." The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often "teach the test" as Mrs. Yeargin did, although most are never caught. 

Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so.
California's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test.
After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students, Texas is revising its security practices. 

And sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming.
These materials, including Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. 's Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets, according to some recent academic research.
By using them, teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate, and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers.
Use of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County, Mrs. Yeargin's school district. 

Experts say there isn't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in South Carolina. 

Under the state's Education Improvement Act, low test scores can block students' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching, state-supervised "interventions" that can mean firings.
High test scores, on the other hand, bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school, grants for special projects, a bonus for the superintendent. 

And South Carolina says it is getting results.
Since the reforms went in place, for example, no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina, although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination.
Critics say South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much.
Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating.
Says the organization's founder, John Cannell, prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is "a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously, when in fact they don't take it seriously at all." 

Paul Sandifer, director of testing for the South Carolina department of education, says Mr. Cannell's allegations of cheating "are purely without foundation," and based on unfair inferences.
Partly because of worries about potential abuse, however, he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets next spring. 

South Carolina's reforms were designed for schools like Greenville High School.
Standing on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city, the school has educated many of South Carolina's best and brightest, including the state's last two governors, Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward.
But by the early 1980s, its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade. 

"It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class," says Linda Ward, the school's principal. "Crime was awful, test scores were low, and there was no enrollment in honors programs." 

Mrs. Ward took over in 1986, becoming the school's seventh principal in 15 years.
Her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown.
Prior to his term, a teacher bled to death in the halls, stabbed by a student.
Academically, Mrs. Ward says, the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate, and evenly split, student groups: a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks, many of them poor, from run-down, inner city neighborhoods. 

Mrs. Ward resolved to clean out "deadwood" in the school's faculty and restore safety, and she also had some new factors working in her behalf.
One was statewide school reform, which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment.
Another was Nancy Yeargin, who came to Greenville in 1985, full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward. 

"Being a teacher just became my life," says the 37-year-old Mrs. Yeargin, a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal. "I loved the school, its history.
I even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students." 

While Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum, Mrs. Yeargin worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite.
In 1986-87 and 1987-88, she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law.
Encouraged by Mrs. Ward, Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state "teacher cadet" program, a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career.
She won grant money for the school, advised cheerleaders, ran the pep club, proposed and taught a new "Cultural Literacy" class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as "Teacher of the Year." 

"She was an inspirational lady; she had it all together," says Laura Dobson, a freshman at the University of South Carolina who had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher-cadet class last year.
She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher.
Mary Beth Marchand, a Greenville 11th grader, also says Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education. "She taught us more in Western Civilization than I've ever learned in other classes," says Kelli Green, a Greenville senior. 

In the classroom, students say, Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions.
On weekends, she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes, even to polish the furniture in her classroom. 

"She just never gave it up," says Mary Marchand, Mary Beth's mother. "You'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game." 

Some fellow teachers, however, viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students.
Mrs. Ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander.
Pressures began to build.
Friends told her she was pushing too hard.
Because of deteriorating hearing, she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer. 

Mrs. Yeargin's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state's incentive-bonus program.
But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests.
Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $23,000. 

Winning a bonus for a third year wasn't that important to her, Mrs. Yeargin insists.
But others at Greenville High say she was eager to win -- if not for money, then for pride and recognition.
Mary Elizabeth Ariail, another social-studies teacher, says she believed Mrs. Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that wouldn't demand good hearing.
Indeed, Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program. 

Last March, after attending a teaching seminar in Washington, Mrs. Yeargin says she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she hadn't prepared her low-ability geography students adequately.
When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time, she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students. 

Mrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct. "I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation," she says. "Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions.
The rest were history, sociology, finance -- subjects they never had." 

Mrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School's overall test scores, usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers.
Mostly, she says, she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test. "These kids broke my heart," she says. "A whole day goes by and no one even knows they're alive.
They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them, who loved them.
The last thing they needed was another drag-down blow." 

School officials and prosecutors say Mrs. Yeargin is lying.
They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help, although because the case wasn't tried in court, this evidence was never presented publicly. "That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child," says Joe Watson, the prosecutor in the case, who is also president of Greenville High School's alumni association.
Mrs. Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class, adding: "I wanted to help all" students. 

Mr. Watson says Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair. "Do I have much sympathy for her?" Mr. Watson asks. "Not really.
I believe in the system.
I believe you have to use the system to change it.
What she did was like taking the law into your own hands." 

Mrs. Ward says that when the cheating was discovered, she wanted to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring.
She says she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate.
Mrs. Yeargin declined. "She said something like `You just want to make it easy for the school. ' I was dumbfounded," Mrs. Ward recalls. "It was like someone had turned a knife in me." 

To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs. Yeargin won widespread local support.
The school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students, teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf.
Supportive callers decried unfair testing, not Mrs. Yeargin, on a local radio talk show on which she appeared. 

The show didn't give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin's offense, saying only that she helped students do better on the test. "The message to the board of education out of all this is we've got to take a serious look at how we're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state," said the talk-show host.
Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong, but also said the case showed how testing was being overused. 

The radio show "enraged us," says Mrs. Ward.
Partly because of the show, Mr. Watson says, the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record.
And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case.
Over 50 witnesses, mostly students, were interviewed. 

At Greenville High School, meanwhile, some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed. "It's hard to explain to a 17-year-old why someone they like had to go," says Mrs. Ward.
Soon, T-shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school's familiar red-and-white GHS logo on the front.
On the back, the shirts read, "We have all the answers." Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin. "She did a lot of harm," says Cathryn Rice, who had discovered the crib notes. "We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay, and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us." 

But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores.
Says Gayle Key, a mathematics teacher, "The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms.
There may be others doing what she did." 

Mrs. Yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement, and because she was afraid of further charges.
Mrs. Ward, for one, was relieved.
Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin, popular sentiment was so strong in her favor, Mrs. Ward says, that "I'm afraid a jury wouldn't have convicted her." 

F.H. Faulding & Co., an Australian pharmaceuticals company, said its Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $23 million. 

Kalipharma is a New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals concern that sells products under the Purepac label. 

Faulding said it owns 33% of Moleculon's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19%.
That stake, together with its convertible preferred stock holdings, gives Faulding the right to increase its interest to 70% of Moleculon's voting stock. 

In reference to your Oct. 9 page-one article "Barbara Bush Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the President," it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives: "Among liberals, 60% have positive views of her, while 50% approve of the president's job performance.
In part, this may reflect the fact that `she speaks a more progressive language' than her husband, as Columbia's Prof. {Ethel} Klein puts it.
Among professionals, 76% have a favorable opinion of her, compared to 62% who approve of her husband's performance.
While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bush's handling of his job, only 15% have a negative view of his spouse." 

The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush's job performance and 85% of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush.
If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful, the positive view is even more newsworthy.
Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious, stereotyped perspective.
Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator.

The Life Insurance Co. of Georgia has officially opened an office in Taipei. 

David Wu, the company's representative in Taiwan, said Atlanta-based Life of Georgia will sell conventional life-insurance products. 

Life of Georgia is part of the Nationale Nederlanden Group, based in the Netherlands. 

Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. said it has reached an agreement in principle to buy buildings and related property in Albany, Ga., from Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. Terms weren't disclosed. 

The tire maker said the buildings consist of 1.8 million square feet of office, manufacturing and warehousing space on 353 acres of land. 

Structural Dynamics Research Corp., which makes computer-aided engineering software, said it introduced new technology in mechanical design automation that will improve mechanical engineering productivity. 

A licensing company representing the University of Pennsylvania added Johnson & Johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin-A acne medicine. 

University Patents Inc., based in Westport, Conn., said it seeks Johnson & Johnson's profits from sales of Retin-A, estimated at $50 million, a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin-A elsewhere. 

In May, University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman, a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin-A in the 1960s to combat acne.
Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University, but later licensed the Retin-A to a division of Johnson & Johnson. 

In New Brunswick, N.J., a Johnson & Johnson spokesman declined comment. 

R.P. Scherer Corp. said it completed the $10.2 million sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led by the unit's president, Thomas R. Sloan, and other managers. 

Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy-out group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year, the maker of gelatin capsules decided to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses.
The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program. 

Alleghany Corp. said it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $150 million. 

The Sacramento-based S&L, which has 44 branch offices in north central California, had assets of $2.4 billion at the end of September.
New York-based Alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern.
The purchase price includes two ancillary companies. 

Magna International Inc. 's chief financial officer, James McAlpine, resigned and its chairman, Frank Stronach, is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around, the company said. 

Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending "until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained," Magna said. 

Stephen Akerfeldt, currently vice president finance, will succeed Mr. McAlpine. 

An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn.
The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years, despite steady sales growth. 

Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars (US$13.73).
On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$9.625. 

Mr. Stronach, founder and controlling shareholder of Magna, resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek, unsuccessfully, a seat in Canada's Parliament. 

Analysts said Mr. Stronach wants to resume a more influential role in running the company.
They expect him to cut costs throughout the organization. 

The company said Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring, assisted by Manfred Gingl, president and chief executive.
Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached for comment. 

Magna said Mr. McAlpine resigned to pursue a consulting career, with Magna as one of his clients. 

Newsweek, trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine, announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers. 

The new ad plan from Newsweek, a unit of the Washington Post Co., is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years.
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek, Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman's U.S. News & World Report. 

Alan Spoon, recently named Newsweek president, said Newsweek's ad rates would increase 5% in January.
A full, four-color page in Newsweek will cost $100,980.
In mid-October, Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates; with a lower circulation base, Time's ad rate will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber; a full page in Time costs about $120,000.
U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates. 

Newsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan, which awards space credits to advertisers on "renewal advertising." The magazine will reward with "page bonuses" advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending, as long as they spent $325,000 in 1989 and $340,000 in 1990. 

Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989; Newsweek's ad pages totaled 1,620, a drop of 3.2% from last year, according to Publishers Information Bureau. "What matters is what advertisers are paying per page, and in that department we are doing fine this fall," said Mr. Spoon. 

Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers, such as telephones or watches.
However, none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently.
According to Audit Bureau of Circulations, Time, the largest newsweekly, had average circulation of 4,393,237, a decrease of 7.3%.
Newsweek's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453, flat from the same period last year.
U.S. News' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328, down 2.6%. 

Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami's "A Wild Sheep Chase" (Kodansha, 320 pages, $18.95), baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common.
Although set in Japan, the novel's texture is almost entirely Western, especially American.
Characters drink Salty Dogs, whistle "Johnny B. Goode" and watch Bugs Bunny reruns.
They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo.
They worry about their careers, drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs.
This is Japan? 

For an American reader, part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan isn't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore.
It's also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly doesn't belong to the self-aggrandizing "we-Japanese" school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese, unfathomable by outsiders.
If "A Wild Sheep Chase" carries an implicit message for international relations, it's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think. 

That's not to say that the nutty plot of "A Wild Sheep Chase" is rooted in reality.
It's imaginative and often funny.
A disaffected, hard-drinking, nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister, erudite mobster with a Stanford degree.
He has in tow his prescient girlfriend, whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly.
Along the way, he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God's phone number; and the Sheep Man, a sweet, roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin. 

The 40-year-old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan.
A more recent novel, "Norwegian Wood" (every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics), has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987.
But he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo's brat pack -- who are dominating the best-seller charts in Japan.
Their books are written in idiomatic, contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana. 

In Robert Whiting's "You Gotta Have Wa" (Macmillan, 339 pages, $17.95), the Beatles give way to baseball, in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a "game." As Mr. Whiting describes it, Nipponese baseball is a "mirror of Japan's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony." "Wa" is Japanese for "team spirit" and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it.
A player's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average.
Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara, a "humble, uncomplaining, obedient soul," as the male symbol of Japan. 

But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat, it's unrecognizable: Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants, for example, must always wear ties when on the road. 

"You Gotta Have Wa" is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers, rationed to two per team, fare in Japan.
Despite the enormous sums of money they're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate, a good number decide it's not worth it and run for home. 

"Funny Business" (Soho, 228 pages, $17.95) by Gary Katzenstein is anything but.
It's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties. 

In sometimes amusing, more often supercilious, even vicious passages, Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers' lives -- at the regimented office, where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at "home" in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker. 

Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark.
It's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity, that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager, and that Sony was chary of letting a young, short-term American employee take on any responsibility.
All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein, who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman. 

But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein, after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita, founder of Sony.
It's a shame their meeting never took place.
Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something, and it's even possible Mr. Morita would have too.

More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke. 

In Singapore, a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before entering restaurants, department stores and sports centers or face a $250 fine.
Discos and private clubs are exempt from the ban, and smoking will be permitted in bars except during meal hours, an official said.
Singapore already bans smoking in all theaters, buses, public elevators, hospitals and fast-food restaurants. 

In Malaysia, Siti Zaharah Sulaiman, a deputy minister in the prime minister's office, launched a "No-Smoking Week" at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools to ban on-campus smoking. 

South Korea has different concerns.
In Seoul, officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes.
South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places. 

A marketing study indicates that Hong Kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out.
The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets, which include the U.S. and Japan.
The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values, compared with about one-third in Japan and the U.S.
More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time, compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan. 

The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu's proposal to build a $19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now.
The meeting, which is expected to draw 20,000 to Bangkok, was going to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel, but the government balked at the hotel's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion.
A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built in such a short time. 

Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee asking him to back a Palestinian bid to join the committee, the Palestine Liberation Organization news agency WAFA said.
An official of the Palestinian Olympic Committee said the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year.
The PLO in recent months has been trying to join international organizations but failed earlier this year to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization. 

A Beijing food-shop assistant has become the first mainland Chinese to get AIDS through sex, the People's Daily said.
It said the man, whom it did not name, had been found to have the disease after hospital tests.
Once the disease was confirmed, all the man's associates and family were tested, but none have so far been found to have AIDS, the newspaper said.
The man had for a long time had "a chaotic sex life," including relations with foreign men, the newspaper said. 

The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150% and doubled gas prices.
The official news agency PAP said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices.
In happier news, South Korea, in establishing diplomatic ties with Poland yesterday, announced $450 million in loans to the financially strapped Warsaw government. 

In a victory for environmentalists, Hungary's parliament terminated a multibillion-dollar River Danube dam being built by Austrian firms. 

The Nagymaros dam was designed to be twinned with another dam, now nearly complete, 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia.
In ending Hungary's part of the project, Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia, which still wants the dam to be built. 

Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned. 

Czechoslovakia said in May it could seek $2 billion from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken.
The Czech dam can't be operated solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project. 

A painting by August Strindberg set a Scandinavian price record when it sold at auction in Stockholm for $2.44 million. "Lighthouse II" was painted in oils by the playwright in 1901 . . . After years of decline, weddings in France showed a 2.2% upturn last year, with 6,000 more couples exchanging rings in 1988 than in the previous year, the national statistics office said.
But the number of weddings last year -- 271,124 -- was still well below the 400,000 registered in 1972, the last year of increasing marriages. 

Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates, but it isn't clear whether the central bank will do so. 

A survey by the Fed's 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks, while upward pressures on prices have moderated. "The economy is clearly slowing," says Robert Black, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank. 

"If you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5% growth, I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter," agrees Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey. 

Nevertheless, both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern. "We're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur," said Mr. Guffey. 

Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates, and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well. "I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date," said Robert Johnson, vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co. 

The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75% after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge, but has shown no sign of movement since. 

The report from the Fed found that manufacturing, in particular, has been weak in recent weeks.
The Philadelphia Fed, for instance, reported that manufacturing activity "continues to decline" for the fourth month in a row.
And in the Chicago district, the report said, "a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types, including defense equipment, petroleum equipment, food packaging machinery and material handling equipment." Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts, particularly "for discretionary, big-ticket items such as furniture, home appliances and consumer electronics." And construction also was described as slow in most areas. 

Despite the economic slowdown, there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt.
As a result, Fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit.
Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move. 

Mr. Black said he is "pleased" with the economy's recent performance, and doesn't see "a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession." 

"There is always a chance of recession," added Mr. Guffey, "but if you ask me to put a percentage on it, I would think it's well below a 50% chance." 

Rally's Inc. said it has redeemed its rights outstanding issued Monday in its shareholder rights plan.
The company said holders of stock of record Nov. 10 will receive 1/10th of one cent a share as the redemption payment. 

The fast-food company said its decision was based upon discussions with a shareholder group, Giant Group Ltd., "in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company." 

Giant Group is led by three Rally's directors, Burt Sugarman, James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II, who last month indicated they hold a 42.5% stake in Rally's and plan to seek a majority of seats on Rally's nine-member board. 

Clark J. Vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this U.S. sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker Mazda Motor Corp.
In the new position he will oversee Mazda's U.S. sales, service, parts and marketing operations.
Previously, Mr. Vitulli, 43 years old, was general marketing manager of Chrysler Corp. 's Chrysler division.
He had been a sales and marketing executive with Chrysler for 20 years. 

LTV Corp. said a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed to extend until March 8, 1990, the period in which the steel, aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan. 

The company is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, giving it court protection from creditors' lawsuits while it attempts to work out a plan to pay its debts. 

Sir Peter Walters, 58-year-old chairman of British Petroleum Co. until next March, joins the board of this cement products company on Dec. 1.
Sir Peter will succeed Sir John Milne, 65, who retires as Blue Circle nonexecutive chairman on June 1. 

BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars (US$85.1 million) of 10.5% senior debentures due Nov. 30, 1999, together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants.
The Toronto-based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.
The warrants expire Nov. 30, 1990.
The issue will be swapped into fixed-rate U.S. dollars at a rate the company said is less than 9%; a spokesman declined to elaborate.
Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc., both Toronto-based investment dealers.
Bramalea said it expects to complete the issue by the end of the month. 

Zenith Data Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp., received a $534 million Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84-month period. 

Rockwell International Corp. won a $130.7 million Air Force contract for AC-130U gunship replacement aircraft. 

Martin Marietta Corp. was given a $29.9 million Air Force contract for low-altitude navigation and targeting equipment. 

Federal Data Corp. got a $29.4 million Air Force contract for intelligence data handling. 

SHAREDATA Inc. said it will amend a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares.
The Chandler, Ariz., company said it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants, each exercisable for the purchase of one common share.
Currently, ShareData has about 4.1 million common shares outstanding.
ShareData develops and markets low-cost software, peripheral equipment and accessories for computers. 

Integra-A Hotel & Restaurant Co. said its planned rights offering to raise about $9 million was declared effective and the company will begin mailing materials to shareholders at the end of this week. 

Under the offer, shareholders will receive one right for each 105 common shares owned.
Each right entitles the shareholder to buy $100 face amount of 13.5% bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share.
The rights, which expire Nov. 21, can be exercised for $100 each. 

Integra, which owns and operates hotels, said that Hallwood Group Inc. has agreed to exercise any rights that aren't exercised by other shareholders.
Hallwood, a Cleveland merchant bank, owns about 11% of Integra. 

Eaton Corp. said it sold its Pacific Sierra Research Corp. unit to a company formed by employees of that unit.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Pacific Sierra, based in Los Angeles, has about 200 employees and supplies professional services and advanced products to industry.
Eaton is an automotive parts, controls and aerospace electronics concern. 

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it plans to institute an additional "circuit breaker" aimed at stemming market slides. 

Separately, John Phelan told a closed House subcommittee meeting in Washington that he would support Securities and Exchange Commission halts of program trading during market emergencies.
But the New York Stock Exchange chairman said he doesn't support reinstating a "collar" on program trading, arguing that firms could get around such a limit. 

The Chicago Merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
If the 20-point limit is triggered after 1:30 p.m. Chicago time, it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m. 

With the limit in effect, members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices, but not below it. 

The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on Friday Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well.
Late that afternoon the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points, hitting a Merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session. 

The Merc said that its existing 30-minute, 12-point limit on S&P 500 stock-index futures trading (equal to about 100 points on the Dow Jones industrials), which was triggered Oct. 13, will remain in effect. 

Leo Melamed, Merc executive committee chairman, said that the 12-point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13.
But when the contract reopened, the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices synchronized. 

Several traders maintained that the Merc's 12-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 

All of the changes require regulatory approval, which is expected shortly. 

The exchange also said that the 30-point circuit breaker, which currently provides only a one-hour respite during market sell-offs, will become the maximum one-day limit for the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract; the one-day limit now is 50 index points. 

A final modification was made to the five-point opening limit for the contract.
The Merc said that five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading.
The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading. 

In Washington, House aides said Mr. Phelan told congressmen that the collar, which banned program trades through the Big Board's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points, didn't work well.
He said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually. 

In a post-hearing news conference, Mr. Phelan, who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility, said he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal "providing the SEC would be comfortable with the language" in a bill. 

The program-trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street, and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile.
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points, but he doesn't want discretionary power to stop programs. 

A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so "vague and mushy" that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could "come out feeling good." At one point, Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers. 

"Markey said we could have done this in public" because so little sensitive information was disclosed, the aide said.
Mr. Phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel, the aide added. 

At another point during the hearing, Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what would be discussed at a New York exchange board meeting today.
Mr. Phelan said the Big Board is likely to study the program-trading issue.
That response annoyed Rep. Markey, House aides said, and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter. 

Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing, most notably Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months. 

Mr. Dingell expressed concern, sources said, about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading, which uses futures to offset stock trades.
The futures industry is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses. 

South Korea registered a trade deficit of $101 million in October, reflecting the country's economic sluggishness, according to government figures released Wednesday. 

Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October, the fifth monthly setback this year, casting a cloud on South Korea's export-oriented economy. 

Exports in October stood at $5.29 billion, a mere 0.7% increase from a year earlier, while imports increased sharply to $5.39 billion, up 20% from last October. 

South Korea's economic boom, which began in 1986, stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes, trade conflicts and sluggish exports.
Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $68 billion. 

Despite the gloomy forecast, South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $71 million so far this year. 

From January to October, the nation's accumulated exports increased 4% from the same period last year to $50.45 billion.
Imports were at $50.38 billion, up 19%. 

Sea Containers Ltd. said it might increase the price of its $70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd., which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers. 

Sea Containers, a Hamilton, Bermuda-based shipping concern, said Tuesday that it would sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece. 

The move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns, Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC.
In May, the two companies, through their jointly owned holding company, Temple, offered $50 a share, or $777 million, for Sea Containers.
In August, Temple sweetened the offer to $63 a share, or $963 million. 

Yesterday, Sea Containers' chief executive officer, James Sherwood, said in an interview that, under the asset-sale plan, Sea Containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $620 million.
About $490 million of that would be allocated to the buy-back, leaving about $130 million, he said. 

That $130 million, Mr. Sherwood said, "gives us some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid.
We are able to increase our price above the $70 level if necessary." He declined to say, however, how much Sea Containers might raise its price. 

Mr. Sherwood speculated that the leeway that Sea Containers has means that Temple would have to "substantially increase their bid if they're going to top us." 

Temple, however, harshly criticized Sea Containers' plan yesterday, characterizing it as a "highly conditional device designed to entrench management, confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer." 

A spokesman for Temple estimated that Sea Containers' plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $36 to $45 a share in cash.
The lower figures, the spokesman said, would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market. 

Temple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda, where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook. {The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month.} 

Temple also said Sea Containers' plan raises "numerous legal, regulatory, financial and fairness issues," but didn't elaborate. 

Mr. Sherwood said reaction to Sea Containers' proposal has been "very positive." In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sea Containers closed at $62.625, up 62.5 cents. 

Investors took advantage of Tuesday's stock rally to book some profits yesterday, leaving stocks up fractionally.
Bond prices and the dollar both gained modestly. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished less than a point higher to close at 2645.90 in moderate trading.
But advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange were tidily ahead of declining stocks, 847 to 644.
Long-term bond prices rose despite prospects of a huge new supply of Treasury debt this month.
Continuing demand for dollars from Japanese investors boosted the U.S. currency. 

Analysts were disappointed that the enthusiasm investors showed for stocks in the wake of Georgia-Pacific's $3.18 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa evaporated so quickly.
The industrial average jumped more than 41 points Tuesday as speculators rushed to buy shares of potential takeover targets.
But with the end of the year in sight, money managers are eager to take profits and cut their risks of losing what for many have been exceptionally good returns in 

Economic news had little effect on financial markets.
As expected, a national purchasing managers' report indicated the nation's manufacturing sector continues to contract modestly.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, a summary of economic conditions across the country, indicated that the overall economy remains in a pattern of sluggish growth. 

In major market activity: 

Stock prices rose fractionally in moderate trading.
Big Board volume totaled 154.2 million shares.
Bond prices were up.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount.
The yield fell to 7.88%. 

The dollar rose.
In late afternoon New York trading the currency was at 1.8500 marks and 143.80 yen compared with 1.8415 marks and 142.85 yen. 

J.P. Bolduc, vice chairman of W.R. Grace & Co., which holds a 83.4% interest in this energy-services company, was elected a director.
He succeeds Terrence D. Daniels, formerly a W.R. Grace vice chairman, who resigned.
W.R. Grace holds three of Grace Energy's seven board seats. 

When it's time for their biannual powwow, the nation's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs. 

Not this year. 

The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting.
And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners.
The idea, of course: to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt isn't so rusty after all, that it's a good place for a company to expand. 

On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag, along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory. 

For starters, the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge.
Champagne and dessert followed. 

The next morning, with a police escort, busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, unimpeded by traffic or red lights.
The governor couldn't make it, so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests.
A buffet breakfast was held in the museum, where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors.
Then, in the guests' honor, the speedway hauled out four drivers, crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10-lap exhibition race. 

After the race, Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers.
No dummies, the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor's name or two. 

Back downtown, the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again.
This time, it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away. 

Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom, nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline, lobster consomme, veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce.
Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one, the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation. 

More than a few CEOs say the red-carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings.
But for now, they're looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February. 

It was Richard Nixon's first visit to China in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between Beijing and Washington.
But the former U.S. president's sixth visit to China, during which he spoke at length with Chinese leaders, was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the Sino-U.S. relationship. 

Mr. Nixon, the most prominent American to come to China since Beijing's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June, harped on international outrage over the massacre.
The Chinese, in turn, took aim at American "interference" in China's domestic affairs. 

One official newspaper, Legal Daily, even directly criticized Mr. Nixon, who is normally referred to here as an "old friend." The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of "peaceful evolution," a catch phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere. 

The tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon's final banquet toast, normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship.
Instead, Mr. Nixon reminded his host, Chinese President Yang Shangkun, that Americans haven't forgiven China's leaders for the military assault of June 3-4 that killed hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators. 

"Many in the United States, including many friends of China, believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified," Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang, who was directly involved in ordering the attack. "The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China." 

The Chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion.
In talks with Mr. Nixon, Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings, and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring.
In a meeting Tuesday, supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, told Mr. Nixon, "Frankly speaking, the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago.
China was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China for it." 

Despite the harsh exchanges, the U.S. and China still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations, which have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to as "the greatest crisis in Chinese-American relations" since his initial visit to China 17 years ago.
In his return toast to Mr. Nixon, Mr. Yang said the relationship had reached a "stalemate." 

Relations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7, when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
Shortly afterwards, Mr. Bush imposed a series of anti-China sanctions, including suspension of most high-level talks, which could be codified in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks. 

Mr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen, but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration.
Mr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, before coming to China on Saturday.
And he plans to brief the president at the end of the week, U.S. sources said.
Mr. Nixon was to leave China today. 

According to an American member of the Nixon party, the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top-level Chinese officials.
These included China's economic policies, human rights and the question of Mr. Fang.
Mr. Nixon also proposed that China restore its participation in the Fulbright Program, a U.S. government-funded academic exchange.
China pulled out of the program in July. 

In his talks, the former president urged China's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas. "Ideas are going over borders, and there's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down," he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday. 

There are no signs, however, of China's yielding on key issues.
But in one minor matter, Mr. Nixon appears to have gained a concession.
In a meeting with Premier Li Peng on Monday, Mr. Nixon said that he hoped he wouldn't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy. 

Sure enough, when he arrived at the embassy two days later, the machine-gun-toting guards were gone -- for the first time in five months.
A few blocks away, at the U.S. ambassador's residence, the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their Uzi-model arms for the first time since early June. 

But the guards there retained their pistols, and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars.
Moreover, police and soldiers continue to harass Americans, who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week.
Several times, Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger.
The rifles weren't loaded. 

The Internal Revenue Service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $10,000 in cash. 

The warnings, issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week, have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar, who claim the information is protected by attorney-client privilege. 

The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions "in the course of trade or business" to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300.
The form asks for such details as the client's name, Social Security number, passport number and details about the services provided for the payment. 

Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November, when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. 

Attorneys have argued since 1985, when the law took effect, that they cannot provide information about clients who don't wish their identities to be known.
Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years, citing attorney-client privilege.
Until last week, the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms. 

"This form forces a lawyer to become, in effect, a witness against his client," said Neal R. Sonnett, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. "The IRS is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government," added Mr. Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated IRS forms sent by certified mail. 

Mr. Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who don't have domestic bank accounts.
These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers.
Mr. Sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals wouldn't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers.
Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients, he said.
The defense lawyers' group formed a task force this week, chaired by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt, to deal with the matter. 

The American Bar Association's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement.
Michael Ross, a New York lawyer who heads the ABA's grand jury committee, said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death. 

Mr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department, which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers, to discuss the issue last May.
At that meeting, he said, the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures wouldn't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice.
Mr. Ross said IRS officials opposed the Justice Department's moderate stance on the matter. 

But in the letters sent in recent days, Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit, told attorneys that "failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated." In some cases, the IRS asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985. 

A spokesman for the IRS confirmed that "there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s," but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now.
Individuals familiar with the Justice Department's policy said that Justice officials hadn't any knowledge of the IRS's actions in the last week. 

Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients, that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors.
Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business.
But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases. 

Some criminal lawyers speculated that the IRS was sending the letters to test the issue.
In a number of recent cases, federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential. 

THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim. 

Often, judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare, but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento, Calif.
On Tuesday, the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm.
The reason: the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise. 

"A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years, and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan," the judge quipped in an interview.
Federal judges make $89,500 annually; in February, Congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50%. 

Judge Ramirez, 44, said it is unjust for judges to make what they do. "Judges are not getting what they deserve.
You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants . . . and nobody blinks an eye.
When you become a federal judge, all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum." 

At his new job, as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, he will make out much better. 

The judge declined to discuss his salary in detail, but said: "I'm going to be a high-priced lawyer." 

DOONESBURY CREATOR'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter. 

Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $11 million, alleging it mounted a "campaign to harass and punish" him for crossing a screenwriters' picket line. 

The dispute involves Darkhorse Productions Inc., a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner.
Mr. Trudeau, a Writers Guild member, also was employed as a writer for Darkhorse, which was covered by a guild collective-bargaining agreement. 

The guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988.
In his lawsuit, Mr. Trudeau says the strike illegally included Darkhorse, and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company.
A spokesman for the guild said the union's lawyers are reviewing the suit.
He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau. 

Mr. Trudeau's attorney, Norman K. Samnick, said the harassment consists mainly of the guild's year-long threats of disciplinary action.
Mr. Samnick said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in New York.
Mr. Samnick, who will go before the disciplinary panel, said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified. 

In addition to the damages, the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. Trudeau. 

ABORTION RULING UPHELD: A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services.
A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so-called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion, such as abortion counseling and referrals.
The rule also prohibits funding for activities that "encourage, promote or advocate abortion." Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services, according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
The panel ruled that the restrictions don't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services don't violate the rights of pregnant women. 

INQUIRY CLEARS TEXAS JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims. 

Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December, two weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park.
The judge was quoted as referring to the victims as "queers" and saying they wouldn't have been killed "if they hadn't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys." 

But Robert R. Murray, a special master appointed by the Texas Supreme Court, said Judge Hampton didn't breach any judicial standards of fairness, although he did violate the state's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case.
Observing that the judge "has never exhibited any bias or prejudice," Mr. Murray concluded that he "would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute" as a victim.
Mr. Murray also said Judge Hampton's comments didn't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice. 

The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, which is empowered to impose sanctions. 

GAF TRIAL goes to round three.
Attorneys in the third stock-manipulation trial of GAF Corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the Manhattan courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe.
In an eight-count indictment, the government has charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., specialty chemical maker, and its Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin with attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in November 1986.
The first two GAF trials ended in mistrials earlier this year.
This trial is expected to last five weeks. 

SWITCHING TO THE DEFENSE: A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran/Contra affair joined the Chicago firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt.
Michael R. Bromwich, a member since January 1987 of the three-lawyer trial team in the prosecution of Oliver North, became a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the 520-lawyer firm.
He will specialize in white-collar criminal defense work.
Mr. Bromwich, 35, also has served as deputy chief and chief of the narcotics unit for the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan. 

The House voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981, casting a solid 382-37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush. 

The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor.
Advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise, to $4.25 an hour by April 1991, is too small for the working poor, while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs. 

But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress, after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise. 

So both sides accepted the compromise, which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977, raising the wage to $3.35 an hour from $2.65.
Under the measure passed yesterday, the minimum wage would rise to $3.80 next April. 

The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it. 

"There are no smiles about this bill," Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.) said during House floor debate yesterday.
But "because it's all we've got, I'm going to vote for it." 

While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage, the level of $4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35% of average factory pay, Mr. Williams said. 

But Rep. Marge Roukema (R., N.J.) instead praised the House's acceptance of a new youth "training" wage, a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years.
Adopting a training-wage policy means "getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage," Mrs. Roukema said. 

Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage, but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force. 

Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea, but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence.
The compromise sets the training wage at $3.35 an hour next April, and at $3.61 an hour, or 85% of the minimum wage, in April 1991. 

Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days, without restriction, to workers with less than six months of job experience, and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers.
The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old. 

The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job. 

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, still opposed to any mininum-wage increase, said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27% in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 "will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers." 

Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29.
Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group. 

As an actor, Charles Lane isn't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin's spirit.
Steve Martin has already laid his claim to that. 

But it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp in a contemporary way.
In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets.
Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp.
Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would be called a homeless person.
So would the Little Tramp, for that matter. 

I say "contained dialogue" because "Sidewalk Stories" isn't really silent at all.
Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would. 

Much of Mr. Lane's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets (though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin's notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit).
Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill, the New York streets of "Sidewalk Stories" seem benign.
On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose, noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs.
The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village, on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers, magicians and other good-natured hustlers. (This clearly is not real life: no crack dealers, no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan, no one curled up in a cardboard box.) 

The Artist has his routine.
He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to.
At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home.
His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree.
He is his own man. 

Then, just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in "City Lights," the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif (Nicole Alysia), whose father has been murdered by thugs, to her mother.
This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse.
She gives the Artist a sense of purpose, but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life.
The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night. 

To further load the stakes, Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist, with a young woman who owns her own children's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building.
This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it. 

Mr. Lane's final purpose isn't to glamorize the Artist's vagabond existence.
He has a point he wants to make, and he makes it, with a great deal of force.
The movie ends with sound, the sound of street people talking, and there isn't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough, beaten voices. 

The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his "Story of Women." He has made a harsh, brilliant picture -- one that's captivating -- about a character who, viewed from the most sympathetic angle, would seem disagreeable. 

Yet this woman, Marie-Louise Giraud, carries historical significance, both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government's hypocrisy.
While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews, its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor.
Marie-Louise, a small-time abortionist, was their woman. 

She became an abortionist accidentally, and continued because it enabled her to buy jam, cocoa and other war-rationed goodies.
She was untrained and, in one botched job killed a client.
Her remorse was shallow and brief.
Although she was kind and playful to her children, she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband; she openly brought her lover into their home.
As presented by Mr. Chabrol, and played with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert, Marie-Louise (called Marie Latour in the film) was not a nice person.
But she didn't deserve to have her head chopped off. 

There is very little to recommend "Old Gringo," a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution.
Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory.
I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot, and this one has Gregory Peck, in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die. 

Video Tip: Before seeing "Sidewalk Stories," take a look at "City Lights," Chaplin's Tramp at his finest. 

Criticism in the U.S. over recent Japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries' relations. 

Officials from both nations say the U.S. public's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington.
Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions; indeed, each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S. 

Where they disagree is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan.
The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment; Japan denies there are real barriers.
The heated talk stirred up by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate, even though it's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative. 

The Japanese "should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy," says Charles Dallara, U.S. assistant Treasury secretary, who has been in Tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders. 

"We have a long history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy," Mr. Dallara says. "U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment" in Japan. 

The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public's rancor.
One clear sign of Japan's nervousness came this week, when a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular, half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. 

"We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests {in the U.S.} to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people," said the spokesman, Taizo Watanabe.
At the same time, though, he chastised the media for paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries, notably Britain, are acquiring more American assets. 

Fears that Japanese investors are buying up America have escalated sharply in the past several weeks, with Sony Corp. 's purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca-Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's acquisition of a 51% holding in Rockefeller Group, the owner of some of midtown Manhattan's most exclusive real estate. 

Even before those moves added fuel, the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in Japan of one U.S. investor, T. Boone Pickens Jr.
The Texas oilman has acquired a 26.2% stake valued at more than $1.2 billion in an automotive-lighting company, Koito Manufacturing Co.
But he has failed to gain any influence at the company.
Koito has refused to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board, asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure Koito's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit. 

Mr. Pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in Japan.
The Senate Finance Committee, chaired by a fellow Texan, Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens's experience in talks with Tokyo "to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets." 

While Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say the question of investors' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public's attention, a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week's talks.
Among them are differences in savings and investment rates, corporate structures and management, and government spending.
Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other. 

The U.S. says it is anxious for results. "We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we've identified, and we need it by next spring," Mr. Dallara says. 

Both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed.
But they haven't clarified what those might be. 

After the first set of meetings two months ago, some U.S. officials complained that Japan hadn't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make.
The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions. 

"Just to say the distribution system is wrong doesn't mean anything," says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official. "We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it." 

That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time, the Japanese say, no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results.
For instance, at the first meeting the two sides couldn't even agree on basic data used in price discussions.
Since then, a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices.
By Monday, they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust. 

"Little by little, there is progress," says the MITI official. "Both sides are taking action."

The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government, the State Department said. 

If the debts are repaid, it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S. However, after two meetings with the Soviets, a State Department spokesman said that it's "too early to say" whether that will happen. 

Coincident with the talks, the State Department said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch.
The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July. 

But a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the $188 million debt, which was lent to the country's short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917. 

Under a 1934 law, the Johnson Debt Default Act, as amended, it's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government, unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization. 

Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value. 

The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act.
But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program. 

Pacific First Financial Corp. said shareholders approved its acquisition by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto for $27 a share, or $212 million. 

The thrift holding company said it expects to obtain regulatory approval and complete the transaction by year-end. 

Commonwealth Edison Co. was ordered to refund about $250 million to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant. 

The refund was about $55 million more than previously ordered by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility. 

State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison to make average refunds of about $45 to $50 each to Edison customers who have received electric service since April 1986, including about two million customers who have moved during that period.
Judge Curry ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that he wouldn't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison. "The refund pool . . . may not be held hostage through another round of appeals," Judge Curry said. 

Commonwealth Edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing Judge Curry's order. 

The exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year.
Commonwealth Edison said the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $1.55 a share.
For 1988, Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $737.5 million, or $3.01 a share. 

A Commonwealth Edison spokesman said that tracking down the two million customers whose addresses have changed during the past 3 1/2 years would be "an administrative nightmare." 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Commonwealth Edison closed at $38.375, down 12.5 cents. 

The $2.5 billion Byron 1 plant near Rockford, Ill., was completed in 1985.
In a disputed 1985 ruling, the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by $49 million to pay for the plant.
But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission's rate increase and found the rates illegal.
The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses.
The utility has been collecting for the plant's construction cost from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986. 

In August, the commission ruled that between $190 million and $195 million of the plant's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded, plus interest.
In his ruling, Judge Curry added an additional $55 million to the commission's calculations.
Last month, Judge Curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9%. 

Commonwealth Edison now faces an additional court-ordered refund on its summer/winter rate differential collections that the Illinois Appellate Court has estimated at $140 million.
And consumer groups hope that Judge Curry's Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edison's Braidwood 2 plant.
Commonwealth Edison is seeking about $245 million in rate increases to pay for Braidwood 2.
The commission is expected to rule on the Braidwood 2 case by year end. 

Last year Commonwealth Edison had to refund $72.7 million for poor performance of its LaSalle I nuclear plant. 

The dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday, buoyed by persistent Japanese demand for U.S. bond issues. 

While market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish U.S. economic indicators, dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U.S. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark. 

At the same time, dealers said the U.S. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks, in part because the hefty Japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark's strength, resulting in a stalemate. 

Jay Goldinger, with Capital Insight Inc., reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in New York -- the strength of the U.S. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds, rather than mark bonds. 

"Dollar-yen {trade} is the driving force in the market," said Tom Trettien, a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York, "but I'm not convinced it will continue.
Who knows what will happen down the road, in three to six months, if foreign investment starts to erode?" 

In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8500 marks, up from 1.8415 marks late Tuesday, and at 143.80 yen, up from 142.85 yen late Tuesday.
Sterling was quoted at $1.5755, down from $1.5805 late Tuesday. 

In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 143.08 yen. 

Douglas Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles, traced the dollar's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings. 

He contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp. 's announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified.
He cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group, as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence. 

The forthcoming maturity in November of a 10-year Japanese government yen-denominated bond issue valued at about $16 billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments, according to Mr. Madison. 

It remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over. 

Meanwhile, traders in Tokyo say that the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions. 

They point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high-yield U.S. Treasury debt and suggest demand for the U.S. unit will continue unabated until rates in the U.S. recede. 

The market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing U.S. economy, and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than U.S. economic indicators. 

Dealers said the dollar merely drifted lower following the release Wednesday of the U.S. purchasing managers' report.
The managers' index, which measures the health of the manufacturing sector, stood at 47.6% in October, above September's 46%, and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3%. 

Some dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50, which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy.
But most said the index had no more than a minimal effect on trade. 

On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $374.20 an ounce, down 50 cents.

THREE COMPUTERS THAT CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in 1977. 

That year the Apple II, Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80 came to market.
The computers were crude by today's standards.
Apple II owners, for example, had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes.
But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I, which was built in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club.
In addition, the Apple II was an affordable $1,298. 

Crude as they were, these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office. 

Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years.
But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the Altair, Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories.
Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts. 

There were many pioneer PC contributors.
William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs, and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981.
Alan F. Shugart, currently chairman of Seagate Technology, led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs.
Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington, two Atlanta engineers, were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone. 

IBM, the world leader in computers, didn't offer its first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market.
Today, PC shipments annually total some $38.3 billion world-wide. 

Argentina said it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $64 billion -- the third-highest in the developing world. 

The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature.
The Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year. 

"Argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50% in the value of its external debt," Mr. Rapanelli said through his spokesman, Miguel Alurralde. 

Mr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford.
Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week to meet with banks. 

Mr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem, who took office July 8, feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved.
But he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven. 

Bank of New England Corp. said it has held talks with potential merger partners outside New England, although it added that nothing is imminent and it hasn't received any formal offers. 

The discussions were disclosed as the bank holding company said that it has dropped its longstanding opposition to full interstate banking bills in Connecticut and in Massachusetts.
Later yesterday, a Massachusetts senate committee approved a bill to allow national interstate banking by banks in the state beginning in 1991. 

Currently, both Massachusetts and Connecticut, where most of Bank of New England's operations are, allow interstate banking only within New England. 

Richard Driscoll, vice chairman of Bank of New England, told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, "Certainly, there are those outside the region who think of us prospectively as a good partner.
We have, and I'm sure others have, considered what our options are, and we've had conversations with people who in the future might prove to be interesting partners." He added, "There's nothing very hot." 

Mr. Driscoll didn't elaborate about who the potential partners were or when the talks were held.
A bank spokeswoman also declined to comment on any merger-related matters, but said the company decided to drop its opposition to the interstate banking legislation because "prevailing sentiment is in favor of passage." 

Bank of New England has been hit hard by the region's real-estate slump, with its net income declining 42% to $121.6 million, or 61 cents a share, in the first nine months of 1989 from the year-earlier period.
The company recently said it would sell some operations and lay off 4% of its work force, altogether reducing employment to less than 16,000 from about 18,000.
It recently signed a preliminary agreement to negotiate exclusively with the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. for the sale of part of its leasing business to the Japanese bank. 

Although two Baby Bells showed strong growth in access lines, usage and unregulated business revenue, one reported a modest gain in third-quarter net while the other posted a small drop. 

Ameritech Corp. 's earnings increased 2.8%, after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its Midwest territory. 

BellSouth Corp. 's third-quarter earnings dropped 3.8% as a result of debt refinancing, the recent acquisition of a cellular and paging property and rate reductions in its Southeast territory. 

BellSouth 

At BellSouth, based in Atlanta, customer access lines grew by 162,000, or 3.5%, during the 12-month period ended Sept. 

For the third quarter, total operating revenue grew 2.6% to $3.55 billion from $3.46 billion.
Total operating expenses increased 3.5% to $2.78 billion from $2.69 billion.
Overall access minutes of use increased 10.3% and toll messages jumped 5.2%. 

BellSouth Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John L. Clendenin said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings.
The refinancing of $481 million in long-term debt reduced net income by $22 million, or five cents a share, but in the long run will save more than $250 million in interest costs.
The company previously said that the recent acquisition of Mobile Communications Corp. of America would dilute 1989 earnings by about 3%.
In addition, earnings were reduced by rate reductions in Florida, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee and Louisiana. 

Ameritech At Ameritech, based in Chicago, customer access lines increased by 402,000, or 2.6%, and cellular mobile lines increased by 80,000, or 62.3%, for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30. 

For the third quarter, revenue increased 1.9% to $2.55 billion from $2.51 billion.
Operating expenses increased 2.6% to $2.04 billion, including one-time pretax charges of $40 million for labor contract signing bonuses.
Local service revenue increased 3.5% and directory and unregulated business revenue jumped 9.5%.
But network access revenue dropped 4% and toll revenue dropped 1.4%.

Dayton Hudson Corp. said it accepted for purchase seven million common shares at $62.875 each, under the terms of a Dutch auction self-tender offer.
The offer expired at 12:01 a.m. yesterday. 

In a Dutch auction, the buyer sets a price range and holders give a price in that range at which they're willing to sell their shares.
The buyer then picks a price and buys shares at that price from holders who offered to sell at that price or lower.
Dayton Hudson's repurchase offer, representing about 9% of its common shares outstanding, had established a range of between $60 and $65 for the buy-back. 

Dayton Hudson said it accepted all odd-lot shares tendered at or below the final $62.875 price; the preliminary proration factor for other shares tendered at or below the final price is 98%. 

The Minneapolis-based retailer said it expects to pay for the seven million shares next Thursday.
Tendered shares not purchased will be returned to holders. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Dayton rose $1 to $61.125. 

Two years of coddling, down the drain. 

That's the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock-market crash. 

Ever since that fearful Black Monday, they've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors -- trying to convince them that Oct. 19, 1987, was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average Americans to put their hard-earned dollars. 

And until last Friday, it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off. "Some of those folks were coming back," says Leslie Quick Jr., chairman, of discount brokers Quick & Reilly Group Inc. "We had heard from people who hadn't been active" for a long time. 

Then came the frightening 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock-market volatility.
All of a sudden, it was back to square one. 

"It's going to set things back for a period, because it reinforces the concern of volatility," says Jeffrey B. Lane, president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "I think it will shake confidence one more time, and a lot of this business is based on client confidence." 

Brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie.
Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash 1987. 

"The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced," says Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman of regional brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc., Baltimore. "I can just tell the questions are right back where they were: `What's going on?,' `Can't anything be done about program trading?,' `Doesn't the exchange understand?,' `Where is the SEC on this? '" 

Mr. Mason says he's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks, even though they believe the deck is stacked against them.
But "these wide swings scare them to death." All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that have big "retail," or individual-investor, businesses.
After expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987 crash, retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead. 

True, the amount of money investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately.
But those dollars have been going into such "safe" products as money market funds, which don't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms.
At discount brokerage Charles Schwab & Co., such "cash-equivalent" investments recently accounted for a record $8 billion of the firm's $25 billion of client's assets. 

The brokers' hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market.
And before last Friday, they were actually making modest progress. 

A slightly higher percentage of New York Stock Exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988, according to Securities Industry Association data.
In 1987, an average 19.7% of Big Board volume was retail business, with the monthly level never more than 21.4%.
The retail participation dropped to an average 18.2% in 1988, and shriveled to barely 14% some months during the year. 

Yet in 1989, retail participation has been more than 20% in every month, and was 23.5% in August, the latest month for which figures are available. 

Jeffrey Schaefer, the SIA's research director, says that all of his group's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in Big Board data.
But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup. 

But "Friday didn't help things," says Mr. Schaefer. 

With the gyrations of recent days, says Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Schwab, many small investors are absolutely convinced that "they shouldn't play in the stock market." 

Joseph Grano, president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc., still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market.
Investors will develop "thicker skins," and their confidence will return, he says.
Friday's plunge, he is telling PaineWebber brokers, was nothing more than a "tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks." 

Meanwhile, PaineWebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving Wall Street their money. "It's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets, rather than push the investor to move into (specific) products such as equities," Mr. Grano says. "The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there's a semblance of confidence." 

It could be a long wait, say some industry observers. "Some investors will tiptoe back in," says Richard Ross, a market research director for Elrick & Lavidge in Chicago. "Then there'll be another swing.
Given enough of these, this will drive everyone out except the most hardy," he adds. 

Mr. Ross, who has been studying retail investors' perception of risks in the brokerage industry, said a market plunge like Friday's "shatters investors' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market." The long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is "miserable," Mr. Ross declares. 

Granges Inc., citing depressed gold prices, said it plans to suspend operations for an indefinite period at its Tartan gold mine in Manitoba. 

Granges said in Vancouver, British Columbia, that the production halt will be phased in over a 10-week period.
Tartan currently produces gold at a cash operating cost of $393 an ounce, which is high by industry standards and $25 or so above the current spot price. 

Granges said it also plans in the third quarter to write down the carrying value of the Tartan mine by 2.5 million Canadian dollars (US$ 2.12 million), and to write off most of the C$6.3 million carrying value of its Windflower gold property in British Columbia. 

Granges didn't say what impact the moves would have on total gold output or earnings, and company officials weren't available. 

Silicon Graphics Inc. 's first-quarter profit rose sharply to $5.2 million, or 28 cents a share, from $1 million, or six cents a share, a year ago. 

The maker of computer workstations said a surge of government orders contributed to the increase.
Revenue rose 95% to $86.4 million from $44.3 million the year earlier. 

In national over-the-counter trading, the company closed yesterday at $23.25 a share, down 25 cents. 

Commodore International Ltd. said it will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major countries. 

That will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for Commodore and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround it had seemed to be engineering.
Commodore, West Chester, Pa., had said in August that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter. 

Commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month.
In fact, Commodore's fiscal fourth-quarter loss was $2 million narrower than Commodore had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed.
Still, even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal 1989 first-quarter earnings of $9.6 million, or 30 cents a share, on sales of $200.2 million. 

Reflecting concerns about Commodore's outlook, its stock has plunged more than 50% since May, closing yesterday unchanged at $8.875 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The price can be expected to erode further, because the loss estimate came after the market closed. 

Commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the U.S., where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that Commodore is close to dropping off research firms' market-share charts. 

Commodore has assembled an experienced management team, it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign.
But those represent long-term strategies that probably won't succeed quickly, even if they turn out to be the right ones.
In the meantime, the strategies will increase expenses. 

Commodore had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas -- mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its Amiga, which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it isn't compatible with Apple Computer Inc. or International Business Machines Corp. hardware.
But sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months, even in West Germany, which has been by far Commodore's strongest market. 

The Commodore 64 and 128, mainly used for children's educational software and games, had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other low-profit personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory.
Commodore has said it expects sales to rebound, but market researchers have said that sales of the low-end products may finally be trailing off. 

Sterling Software Inc. said it lost its bid to supply software services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif.
Sterling, which estimated the value of the contract at $150 million, said NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations. 

In 1988, Dallas-based Sterling protested a similar decision by NASA involving the same contract, claiming it had submitted the lowest bid.
As a result, last March the General Services Administration board of contract appeals directed NASA to reopen negotiations on the contract. 

Sterling said it had requested a briefing by NASA but had not decided whether to protest the agency's latest decision. 

FARMERS REAP abundant crops.
But how much will shoppers benefit? 

The harvest arrives in plenty after last year's drought-ravaged effort: The government estimates corn output at 7.45 billion bushels, up 51% from last fall.
Soybean production swells 24%.
As a result, prices paid to farmers for the commodities, which are used in products as diverse as bubble gum and chicken feed, plummet 20% to 33%.
But don't expect too much in the way of price breaks soon at the supermarket.
Economists expect consumer food prices to jump 5.5% this year to the highest level since 1980 and up from last year's 4.1% rise.
Next year may see a drop of one percentage point. 

Beef prices, hovering near records since the drought, could drop in earnest this winter if ranchers expand herds.
Lower feed prices may help animals eat more cheaply, but humans have to factor in an expensive middleman: the processor.
Food companies probably won't cut their prices much, blaming other costs. "Labor takes the biggest single chunk out of the `food dollar, '" says Frank Pankyo of the Food Institute. 

Stokely says stores revive specials like three cans of peas for 99 cents.
Two cans cost 89 cents during the drought. 

IF IN VITRO fertilization works, it usually does so after only a few tries. 

Costly infertility problems and procedures proliferate as aging baby boomers and others decide to have children -- now.
It's estimated that one in six couples experiences infertility, and in 1987, Americans spent about $1 billion to fight the problem.
Only about five states now offer some form of insurance coverage, but more are expected.
A letter in the New England Journal of Medicine notes that while technology offers "almost endless hope . . . when to stop has become a difficult question. . . ." 

The authors, from Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, say that 84% of the 50 births they followed occurred after only two in vitro cycles.
It adds that births were "extremely unlikely" after the fourth cycle and concludes couples who don't achieve a pregnancy after four to six procedures should be advised that success is unlikely.
Some couples continue to try. "Such determination may translate into extreme physical, emotional and financial costs," the letter warns.

PACS GIVE and receive in a debatable duet with employees' favored charities. 

The Federal Election Commission clears corporate plans to donate to an employee's chosen charity in exchange for the worker's gift to the company political action committee.
Latest approvals: Bell Atlantic's New Jersey Bell and General Dynamics.
Companies get more political clout plus a possible tax-deductible charitable donation -- so far no word from the IRS on deductibility.
Detroit Edison, the plan pioneer, generated $54,000 in matching funds this year, up from $39,000 in 1988.
But the utility may not continue next year. "We're on a tight budget," says Detroit Edison's Carol Roskind. 

Two election commission members opposed the matching plans.
Scott E. Thomas says the plans give employees "a bonus in the form of charitable donations made from an employer's treasury" in exchange for the political donation. "The U.S. government could be, in effect, subsidizing political contributions to corporate PACs," he says.
New Jersey Bell awaits state clearance. 

Despite federal approval, General Dynamics says it decided it won't go ahead with the matching program. 

CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS find a helping hand from some catalog companies. 

Blunt Ellis & Loewi estimates direct mail catalog sales rose to $12 billion last year.
And while it's too soon to tell how sales will fare in the important 1989 Christmas season, some companies take steps to ease the usual 11th-hour crush.
Spiegel promises a "Guaranteed Christmas," with a pledge to deliver goods before Christmas if ordered by Dec. 20.
And, for an extra $6, Land's End will deliver orders within two days; customers can designate the day. 

Spiegel, which also owns Eddie Bauer and Honeybee, says that since 1987, sales have doubled during the week before Christmas.
An L.L. Bean spokeswoman notes: "People are just used to living in a last-minute society." Blunt Ellis, a Milwaukee brokerage firm, says part of the reason catalog sales grow in popularity is because consumers have more money but less time to spend it. 

L.L. Bean hires about 2,700 workers for the season rush, about 300 more than last year; Land's End hires 2,000.

Continental Bank Corp. 's third-quarter net income slipped 11% despite a big gain from the sale of the company's London headquarters building. 

The $55 million gain on the sale was offset by lower interest income, poorer results from foreign-exchange trading and a $9 million loss on the sale of a unit, Securities Settlement Corp. 

Chicago-based Continental earned $65.2 million, or $1.04 a share, compared with $73.6 million, or $1.19 a share, a year earlier.
The 1988 quarter also included one-time gains totaling about $35 million. 

The bank, which has loss reserves equal to about half its long-term and medium-term loans to less-developed nations, said it doesn't think additional reserves are required.

Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the San Francisco Bay area for months to come. 

But rail, air and ocean-shipping links to the area escaped Tuesday's earthquake with only minor damage, and many are expected to be operating normally today, government and corporate transport officials said. 

Air traffic at San Francisco International Airport was running about 50% of normal yesterday afternoon, but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by Saturday.
The major gateway to Asia and one of the nation's 10 busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit Tuesday afternoon, until 6 a.m. PDT yesterday when controllers returned to the tower. 

Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem, however. "People's ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted," said a spokesman for the American Automobile Association. 

Tom Schumacher, executive vice president and general manager of the California Trucking Association in Sacremento, said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the Bay area yesterday, except for emergency-medical supplies. "Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday," he said. "Right now most of the roads into the Bay area are closed, but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes.
This {Wednesday} morning the San Mateo bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed," Mr. Schumacher said. 

United Parcel Service, Greenwich, Conn., said its operations in the San Francisco area have been reduced to 40% of normal.
A UPS spokesman said that although none of the company's terminals, trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake, road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages.
The spokesman noted four-hour to five-hour traffic delays on the San Mateo bridge, for example.
In addition, power failures prevented its package-sorting facilities from operating, causing delays. 

But freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor, with Santa Fe Pacific Corp. 's rail unit the least affected by the quake.
Santa Fe stopped freight trains Tuesday night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at 10:45 p.m. when they found no damage. 

Union Pacific Corp. 's rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its Oakland yard, its track, bridges and structures were unharmed.
That railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work. 

Southern Pacific Transportation Co., the hardest hit of the three railroads in the Bay area, said service on its north-south coastline, which is used by an Amtrak train between Los Angeles and Seattle, was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake.
But service on the line is expected to resume by noon today. "We had no serious damage on the railroad," said a Southern Pacific spokesman. "We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down." 

Amtrak said it suspended train service into its Oakland station, which sustained "heavy structural damage" during the quake.
The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in Sacramento, relying on buses to ferry passengers to the Bay area.
Amtrak said it planned to resume some train operations to Oakland late yesterday. 

Rail-transit operations suffered little damage, according to Albert Engelken, deputy executive director of the American Public Transit Association in Washington.
The Bay Area Rapid Transit "withstood the earthquake perfectly," said Mr. Engelken, adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day to provide an alternative for highway travelers. "The highway system is screwed up" by the earthquake, Mr. Engelken said. "The transit system is how people are going to be getting around." He added that San Francisco's trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels. 

Although air-traffic delays in San Francisco were significant yesterday, they didn't appear to spread to other airports.
The earthquake shattered windows at San Francisco International's air-traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers, three of whom suffered minor injuries.
Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged, but the tower itself was intact.
Tuesday night, thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel. 

Runways at San Francisco weren't damaged, but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour -- down from 33 to 45 an hour normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows, an FAA spokeswoman said. 

While the airport was closed, flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton, Calif.; Reno and Las Vegas, Nev.; and Los Angeles.
United Airlines, the largest carrier at San Francisco, was operating only 50% of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal, which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area.
A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable, mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors. 

The United spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport; in fact, as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night, two babies were born. 

Yesterday, the United ticket counter was active, with people trying to get flights out, but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active, with people trying to get there to help family and friends. 

The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration said. 

In terms of diversions, Denver's Stapleton International may have experienced the most far-flung: A United flight from Japan was rerouted there. "I think that's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from Japan to land here," an airport spokesman said. 

A Japan Air Lines spokesman said its flights into and out of San Francisco weren't affected, but getting information about its operations was difficult.
Its telecommunications headquarters in Burlingame, Calif., had been knocked out since the quake. "We're in the dark," he said. 

John V. Holmes, an investment-newsletter publisher, and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies. 

As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms. 

Mr. Holmes was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984, after the SEC questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter.
In 1986, in another consent agreement with the SEC, Mr. Holmes was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws.
Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes, that agreement settled SEC charges that Mr. Holmes sold unregistered securities and misled investors. 

In charges filed last week in federal district court in Charlotte, N.C., the SEC alleged that Venture Capitalists Inc., Venture Finance Corp. and New Ventures Fund Inc., all of Charlotte, failed repeatedly to file proper documents.
The SEC also charged that Mr. Holmes acted as an officer or director of New Ventures, in violation of his previous consent agreement. 

"Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions, all of which cost money," Mr. Holmes said. 

Two of Mr. Holmes's business associates who worked for Venture Capitalists, Kimberly Ann Smith and Frederick Byrum, also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws.
Ms. Smith also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from acting as an officer, director or investment adviser of any mutual fund, unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company. 

Mr. Byrum and Ms. Smith couldn't be reached for comment.
In consenting to the injunctions, none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations. 

Computer Associates International Inc., Garden City, N.Y., and Digital Equipment Corp. said they agreed to jointly develop software to help manage Digital's Vax computers. 

Computer Associates has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of International Business Machines Corp. computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30% and more each year.
The market for system-management software for Digital's hardware is fragmented enough that a giant such as Computer Associates should do well there. 

At the same time, the market is smaller than the market for IBM-compatible software.
For one thing, Digital, Maynard, Mass., has sold fewer machines.
In addition, its machines are typically easier to operate, so customers require less assistance from software. 

The space shuttle Atlantis boosted the Galileo spacecraft on its way to Jupiter, giving a big lift as well to an ambitious U.S. program of space exploration. 

Seven years late in the launching, $1 billion over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors, Galileo has long been a symbol of trouble for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
But yesterday, as Atlantis rumbled into a patch of clear sky above Florida with storm clouds closing in on it, NASA sought to turn Galileo into a symbol of triumph. 

"NASA did it right; that's the message," said J.R. Thompson, the agency's deputy administrator. 

The $1.4 billion robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore Jupiter and its 16 known moons.
If all goes well, it will parachute a probe into the dense Jovian atmosphere in July 1995 to pick up detailed data about gases that may be similar to the material from which the solar system was formed 4.6 billion years ago.
Jupiter is so enormous -- its mass is 318 times that of Earth -- that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape. 

Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the "cosmic paradox" of life: Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth, but these planets are lifeless; Earth, on the other hand, has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life.
Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material from the outer solar system to Earth to spawn life. 

Beginning in December 1995, Galileo will begin a two-year tour of the Jovian moons.
In 1979, two Voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of Jovian moons Io and Europa that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system.
The photos showed active geysers on Io spewing sulfurous material 190 miles into its atmosphere and indicated that Europa may have an ocean hidden under a thick sheet of ice. 

Galileo's photos of Europa will be more than 1,000 times as sharp as Voyager's, according to Torrence Johnson, Galileo's project scientist, and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on Earth. 

Atlantis lifted Galileo from the launch pad at 12:54 p.m. EDT and released the craft from its cargo bay about six hours later. "Galileo is on its way to another world in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world," Atlantis Commander Donald Williams said. "Fly safely." 

The five-member Atlantis crew will conduct several experiments, including growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space, before their scheduled landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., Monday. 

The Galileo project started in 1977, and a number of project veterans were on hand to watch the launch.
An ebullient Mr. Johnson, wearing a NASA baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars, called the launch "fantastic." Benny Chin, manager of the Galileo probe, compared it to watching a child leave home. "I'm happy and sad," he said. 

Anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view.
Having argued that Galileo's plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday, they weren't quieted by yesterday's successful launch.
Galileo will skim past Earth in 1990 and 1992, collecting energy from the planet's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to Jupiter.
The protesters point out that Galileo also could crash to Earth then. 

They said they dropped plans to infiltrate the Kennedy Space Center after NASA beefed up its security.
One protest did get past NASA's guard, though; a computer virus caused anti-Galileo messages to flash onto some computer screens at NASA centers. 

The successful launch continues a remarkable recovery in the U.S. space-science program.
An unmanned spacecraft, Magellan, already is heading to Venus and is due to begin mapping the planet next August.
Voyager 2 sent back spectacular photos of Neptune and its moon, Triton, this summer. 

Next month, NASA plans to launch a satellite to study cosmic rays dating from the birth of the universe.
In December, the shuttle Columbia will try to retrieve a satellite that's been in orbit for nearly five years measuring the deleterious effects of space on materials and instruments.
Next March, the shuttle Discovery will launch the Hubble space telescope, a $1.5 billion instrument designed to see the faintest galaxies in the universe. 

Not all of NASA's space-science work will be so auspicious, though.
Around Thanksgiving, the Solar Max satellite, which NASA repaired in orbit in 1984, will tumble back into the Earth's atmosphere.
NASA won't attempt a rescue; instead, it will try to predict whether any of the rubble will smash to the ground and where. 

Silicon Valley heaved a sigh of relief yesterday. 

Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along with the rest of the San Francisco Bay area, a spot check of computer makers turned up little, if any, potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment. 

Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the Valley of either hardware or software goods.
Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. were all up and running yesterday, though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways; others elected to take the day off. 

"These systems are more rugged than many people would believe," said Thomas Kurlak, who tracks the computer industry for Merrill Lynch Research. "It's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit." 

Other companies, including International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., completely idled their operations because of Tuesday evening's temblor, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
Personnel spent the morning inspecting buildings for structural weaknesses, mopping up water from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory floors. 

Still, many were confident that "in a day or two, everything should be back to normal," according to a spokeswoman for the Semiconductor Industry Association, based in Cupertino.
IBM, for instance, said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its San Jose plant, which puts out disk drives for the 3090 family of mainframes.
A Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said that, while "things are a big mess," some 18,000 Valley employees have been called back to work today. 

Apple Computer added that it was being "cautiously optimistic," despite not yet closely eyeballing all of its 50 buildings in the region.
Even the carefully calibrated machinery in its giant Fremont plant, to the north of the Valley, was believed to be undamaged.
Sun Microsystems Inc. and Tandem Computers Inc. also signaled that they should recover quickly. 

Digital Equipment Corp., with major facilities in Santa Clara, Cupertino, Palo Alto and Mountain View, said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in Maynard, Mass., Tuesday night.
None sustained "significant" damage, a spokesman said, adding that "the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked and were all found to be operating normally." 

For many companies, of course, there is still a slew of nagging problems to grapple with, some of which have the potential to become quite serious.
For example, a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices said the Sunnyvale chip maker is worried about blackouts.
A sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built. 

But, given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business, the bulk of Valley companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas. 

Several factors apparently spared the Valley -- a sprawling suburban stretch from San Jose to Palo Alto -- from the kind of impact felt in San Francisco, an hour's drive north.
For one thing, buildings there tend to be newer and, thus, in step with the latest safety codes.
Also, the soil in the Valley is solid, unlike the landfill of San Francisco's downtown Marina District, which was hit with fires and vast destruction. 

In addition, some microelectronics companies said they were prepared for tremulous conditions like Tuesday's.
Their machine tools are even bolted to the shop floor.
Intel said that over the past decade, it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves, sensitive to the shake of an earthquake, in the pipes that snake through its plants. 

Like other large Valley companies, Intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation, so that a breakdown at one location shouldn't leave customers in a total pinch. 

That's certainly good news for such companies as Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the Valley on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory.
Compaq said it foresees no difficulties in obtaining parts in the immediate future. 

Computer makers were scrambling to help customers recover from the disaster.
Digital Equipment has set up disaster-recovery response centers in Dallas, Atlanta and Colorado Springs, Colo.
These units were handling calls both from people in the San Francisco area and from computers themselves, which are set to dial Digital automatically when trouble arises.
They then run remotely controlled self-diagnostic programs.
Digital also said it has dispatched teams of technicians to California. 

Meanwhile, several other major installations around the Valley -- America's center of high-tech -- said they, too, fared as well as could be expected.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the Energy Department tests and conducts research on nuclear weapons, had only "superficial damage," a spokesman said. 

At Lockheed Corp. 's missiles and space systems group in Sunnyvale, about 40 miles south of San Francisco, workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that "there were no show-stoppers" in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus. 

Several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny to make sure they weren't in danger of crumbling, but "the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape," an official said. 

One of Lockheed's most lucrative sectors -- accounting for more than half the aerospace company's $10.59 billion in sales in 1988 -- the missiles and space group is the prime Pentagon contractor on the Trident II ballistic missile.
It also generates pieces of the missile shield called the Strategic Defense Initiative. 

Fortunately, the Hubble Space Telescope -- set to be launched on the shuttle next year in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted 14 billion years ago from the farthest reaches of the universe -- was moved from Sunnyvale to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the beginning of October.

Resolution Funding Corp. plans to sell $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday in the agency's first sale of securities. 

The new bonds will be dated Oct. 30 and mature Oct. 15, 2019.
Tenders for the bonds, available in minimum denominations of $1,000, must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Wednesday at Federal Reserve banks. 

Refcorp, created by the thrift-overhaul law enacted in August, will use the proceeds to merge or sell off ailing savings-and-loan institutions.
Congress authorized $50 billion to be borrowed to pay for the thrift bailout.
Of that amount, $20 billion has already been borrowed by the Treasury Department. 

Unless otherwise specified in a particular offer, the bonds won't be subject to redemption prior to maturity.
Interest payments on the bonds will be payable semiannually. 

The bonds are subject to federal taxation in the U.S., including income taxes.
At the state and local level, the bonds are subject to surtaxes and estate, inheritance and gift taxes, but exempt from taxation as to principal and interest. 

Addington Resources Inc. said it called for redemption on Nov. 21 its $25.8 million outstanding of 8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2013. 

The debentures were issued in the face amount of $46 million on July 11, 1988, the Ashland, Ky., coal mining, water transportation and construction company said.
The company said the redemption is permitted because the price of Addington's stock has equaled or exceeded $19.60 for 20 consecutive trading days, a condition set in the terms of the debentures. 

Debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the $1,103.11 redemption price. 

Champion International Corp. 's third-quarter profit dropped 17%, reflecting price declines for certain paper products, operating problems at certain mills, and other factors. 

The paper producer reported that net income fell to $102.1 million, or $1.09 a share, from $122.4 million, or $1.29 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales rose 2.6% to $1.32 billion from $1.29 billion. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Champion's shares rose 25 cents to $32.125. 

Equitec Financial Group said it will ask as many as 100,000 investors in 12 of its public real-estate limited partnerships to give approval to rolling them up into a new master limited partnership. 

Under the proposal by Equitec, a financially troubled real-estate syndicator, New York-based Hallwood Group Inc. would replace Equitec as the newly formed master limited partnership's general partner and manager.
Shares of the new partnership would trade on an exchange like a stock. 

Hallwood is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership, management and financial restructuring of shopping centers, office buildings, apartments and other real estate. 

In a statement, Equitec Chairman Richard L. Saalfeld said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the 12 limited partnerships included in the proposed rollup.
While he didn't describe the partnerships' financial condition, he said their operations "continue to drain the resources of Equitec." 

Equitec posted a $3.3 million net loss in the second quarter on $11.8 million of revenue, compared with a net loss of $12.9 million in the year-earlier period on revenue of $9.1 million. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Equitec closed at $2.625 a share, unchanged. 

Because of Tuesday's earthquake in Northern California, company officials couldn't immediately be reached for additional comment. 

A spokesman for Hallwood said the 12 limited partnerships, which were marketed by brokerage firms and financial planners between 1979 and 1984, raised several hundred million dollars from investors. 

International Business Machines Corp. said its board approved the purchase of $1 billion of its common shares, a move that should help support its battered stock. 

Even as the stock market has generally done well this year, IBM's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of $130.875.
Yesterday's closing price of $101.75, down 50 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, puts the stock at about 1 1/2 times book value, which is as low as it has sunk over the past decade. 

The announcement came after the market's close. 

The move by IBM wasn't exactly a surprise.
The company has spent some $5 billion over the past 3 1/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares, or roughly 7% of those outstanding. 

In addition, despite IBM's well-publicized recent problems, the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash.
As of the end of the second quarter, it had $4.47 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand. 

As a result, some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that IBM would authorize additional purchases. 

In Armonk, N.Y., a spokesman said that although IBM didn't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock, it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity. 

"We view it as a good long-term investment," the spokesman said. 

In the short term, the move is likely to have little effect.
At yesterday's closing price, $1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares, or less than 2% of the roughly 580 million outstanding.
In addition, as of Sept. 30, the company still had authorization to buy $368 million of stock under a prior repurchase program. 

Over the long term, however, IBM's stock repurchases -- along with its hefty, $4.84-a-share annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors -- are providing a floor for the stock price. 

Although IBM last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year, it began faltering as early as January.
First, it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes, IBM's bread-and-butter business.
Then it had a series of smaller glitches, including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations.
Finally, IBM had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk drives, which account for 10% of its $60 billion of annual revenue. 

None of the problems is necessarily fatal, and they aren't all necessarily even related.
There are also other factors at work that are outside IBM's control, such as currency exchange rates.
The strong dollar, which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars, is expected to knock 80 to 85 cents off IBM's per-share earnings for the full year.
Without that problem, IBM might have matched last year's earnings of $5.81 billion, or $9.80 a share. 

Still, investors will take some convincing before they get back into IBM's stock in a big way.
Steve Milunovich, a securities analyst at First Boston, said that while investors were looking for an excuse to buy IBM shares a year ago, even the big institutional investors are looking for a reason to avoid the stock these days. 

Hunter Environmental Services Inc. said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about $40 million and assumption of related debt.
The buyer wasn't identified. 

The company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management. 

In addition, Hunter said it will use proceeds from a private placement of $8 million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental impairment insurance. 

Hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous wastes in salt domes. 

FREDERICK'S OF HOLLYWOOD Inc., Los Angeles, said its board voted a 50% increase in the specialty boutique-store operator's semiannual dividend, to five cents a common share.
The dividend is payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov. 15. 

After failing to find a buyer for the Sears Tower in Chicago, Sears, Roebuck & Co. is negotiating with Boston pension fund adviser Aldrich, Eastman & Waltch Inc. to refinance the property for close to $850 million, according to people close to the negotiations. 

Under the proposed agreement involving the world's tallest building, Chicago-based Sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage.
At the end of the term of the convertible loan, Sears could still own half the building, and AEW could own the other half.
Neither side would comment. 

The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building, which will be emptied of 6,000 employees from Sears' merchandise group, which is moving elsewhere.
The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft Chicago real estate market.
Also, it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage AEW will be able to convert into equity. 

Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late.
In a convertible mortgage, the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity, usually less than 50%, at the end of the loan term.
During the term, the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow, a percentage of the building's appreciation or a fixed return.
The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal. 

Sears said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring.
But Japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment. 

Last summer, Sears appeared to have a deal with Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd.
But that deal fell through in September after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment, raising property taxes, and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices. 

Real estate industry executives said Sears' investment banker, Goldman, Sachs & Co., sought financing in Japan.
However, Japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity. 

Sears then went back to AEW, the Boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring.
AEW has $3.5 billion of real estate investments nationwide, according to a spokesman. 

One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention.
The deportation of more than 315,000 men, women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years.
Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry: that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century.
Today's Turks in Bulgaria, in other words, deserve what is coming to them four centuries later. 

As if this weren't enough, the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act.
On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24, 1990, as the "National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923," suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire. 

There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering, but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve.
It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey, a country that has been one of America's strongest allies in NATO.
The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community. 

Turkey has been fighting its past for years, and thus far has been only partially successful.
Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people?
Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis. 

Mr. Dole's odd effort notwithstanding, most of Turkey's political problems lie with the Europeans.
Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location -- Turkey isn't really part of Europe.
Why, they wonder, should it belong to the EC?
Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people: Turkey, we are told, is not a Christian nation; its people simply won't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition.
It's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore. 

No one has to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire to reject that argument.
Turkey in any event is long past it.
The country has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations.
Kurds, suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria, Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey.
Now it is their fellow Turks arriving as refugees from Bulgaria. 

The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis cannot be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently.
Surely, the past suffering of any people at any time cannot be simply filed away and forgotten.
But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories. 

Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists.
Bulgaria's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months, and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past. 

The Associated Press's earthquake coverage drew attention to a phenomenon that deserves some thought by public officials and other policy makers.
Private relief agencies, such as the Salvation Army and Red Cross, mobilized almost instantly to help people, while the Washington bureaucracy "took hours getting into gear." One news show we saw yesterday even displayed 25 federal officials meeting around a table.
We recall that the mayor of Charleston complained bitterly about the federal bureaucracy's response to Hurricane Hugo.
The sense grows that modern public bureaucracies simply don't perform their assigned functions well. 

Four years ago, Pittsburgh was designated the most-livable U.S. city by Rand McNally's Places Rated Almanac, and the honor did wonders to improve Pittsburgh's soot-stained image. 

"People asked, is it really true?" says Maury Kelley, vice president, marketing services, for Beecham Products USA, a maker of health and personal-care products that used the ranking in its recruiting brochure. 

Yuba City, Calif., meanwhile, ranked dead last among 329 metro areas.
Unamused, residents burned Rand McNally books and wore T-shirts that said: "Kiss my Atlas." 

The almanac will be making new friends and enemies on Oct. 27, when an updated version will be released. 

Pittsburgh figures it will be dethroned but plans to accept its ouster graciously.
The city's Office of Promotion plans media events to welcome its successor. 

"We're encouraging a graceful transition," says Mary Kay Poppenberg, the organization's president. "Our attitude is that (the ranking) is like Miss America.
Once you're Miss America, you're always Miss America." 

Tell that to Atlanta, which Pittsburgh replaced as the most-livable city in 1985.
Many Atlantans thought Pittsburgh was an unworthy heir.
A columnist in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution wrote: "Who did the research for this report?
Two guys from Gary, Ind.?" 

Not so.
Co-authors David Savageau and Richard Boyer, live in Gloucester, Mass., and Asheville, N.C., respectively. "Atlanta," Mr. Savageau sniffs, "has unrealistic pretensions to world-class status." 

The new edition lists the top 10 metropolitan areas as Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif.; Boston; Louisville, Ky.; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y.; New York; Pittsburgh; San Diego; San Francisco; Seattle; and Washington.
Mr. Savageau says earthquake or not, San Francisco makes the list. 

But attention also rivets on who finishes last, and Pine Bluff, Ark. -- which finished third to last in 1981 and second to last in 1985 -- is certainly in the running. 

"I hate to dignify the publication by commenting on the obscene rating," Mayor Carolyn Robinson says, adding that cities have no way to rebut the book. "It's like fighting your way out of a fog.
You don't know which way to punch." 

Galveston-Houston Co. said it will redeem all 3,950 shares of its privately held 6.5% convertible Series C preferred stock Nov. 8. 

Holders can either convert each share into 421 shares of the company's common stock, or surrender their shares at the per-share price of $1,000, plus accumulated dividends of $6.71 a share. 

Galveston-Houston makes and markets products for the construction, mining and energy industries. 

Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses, the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina would have been much less, as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial "Subsidizing Disaster." 

Congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands, such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near Charleston. 

As you mentioned, subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System.
The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting "The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989." 

This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support.
Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development.
However, home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction. 

A Taxpayers Union study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to $9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years.
Already, the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated $800 million.

AMR Corp. posted an 8.8% drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be "disappointing" as well, primarily because of slimmer profit margins and increased fuel costs. 

AMR's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of American Airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records.
Some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988. 

Still, AMR's stumble doesn't bode well for the rest of the industry.
The Fort Worth, Texas, company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business, and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days. 

Meanwhile, the company's board, which had said nothing publicly about investor Donald Trump's recently withdrawn $7.5 billion offer for AMR, issued a statement condemning "ill-conceived and reckless" bids and saying it was "pleased" that Mr. Trump had backed out. 

In the third quarter, AMR said, net fell to $137 million, or $2.16 a share, from $150.3 million, or $2.50 a share.
Revenue rose 17% to $2.73 billion from $2.33 billion a year earlier. 

AMR's chairman, Robert L. Crandall, said the results were due to an 11% year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield, an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold. 

"We think these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well," he said.
Tim Pettee, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., said: "The business turned faster than expected.
Costs are giving them a little bit of trouble, and the whole industry is having a pricing problem." 

For the nine months, AMR's net rose 15% to $415.9 million, or $6.59 a share, from $360.1 million, or $5.99 a share.
Revenue jumped 22% to $7.89 billion from $6.46 billion. 

AMR's board, in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday, said: "Ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee, financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of AMR shareholders. . . . AMR has not been, and is not, for sale." 

Mr. Crandall said the company's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather. 

"Our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital base," he said. 

Stock prices closed slightly higher in the first routine trading day since Friday's big plunge.
Some issues were affected by Tuesday's devastating earthquake in the San Francisco area. 

Activity continued to slow from the hectic pace set during the market's plunge late Friday and its rebound Monday, as players began to set their sights on events coming later this week. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted through the session within a trading range of about 30 points before closing with a gain of 4.92 at 2643.65. 

Broader averages also posted modest gains.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.60 to 341.76, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.71 to 320.54 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.43 to 189.32.
Some 822 New York Stock Exchange issues advanced in price, while 668 declined. 

But the Dow Jones Transportation Average went down for the seventh consecutive session, due largely to further selling in UAL.
The average dropped 6.40 to 1247.87 and has now lost 21.7% of its value since the losing streak began Oct. 10. 

Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares, in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks, from 224.1 million Tuesday.
Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September, due today, and tomorrow's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown. 

In addition, activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake, which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area. 

Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake, but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying.
The early move essentially established the day's trading range, and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently. 

"I didn't expect it to be this quiet.
I expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last Friday did some selling," said Raymond F. DeVoe, a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker, Baltimore. 

Mr. DeVoe said he expects prices to show some renewed instability over the next few sessions as institutions re-evaluate their stance toward the market in light of its decline. "I would suspect that a lot of investment committees are looking into whether (they) want to be in stocks at all," he said. 

Insurance stocks were sold at the opening amid concerns about the level of damage claims the companies would receive as a result of the earthquake.
But those issues recovered quickly and turned higher because of expectations that the quake and the recent Hurricane Hugo would set the stage for an increase in premium rates. 

Issues of insurance brokers were especially strong.
Marsh & McLennan advanced 3 1/8 to 75 7/8, Alexander & Alexander Services climbed 2 to 32 and Corroon & Black firmed 1 7/8 to 37 1/2. 

Elsewhere in the group, General Re rose 2 3/4 to 86 1/2, American International Group gained 3 1/4 to 102 5/8, Aetna Life & Casualty added 2 3/8 to 59 1/2 and Cigna advanced 7/8 to 62 1/2.
Loews, the parent of CNA Financial, rose 1 3/8 to 123 1/8. 

Companies in the construction, engineering and building-products sectors were among other beneficiaries of earthquake-related buying.
The heavy-construction sector was the session's best performer among Dow Jones industry groups; Fluor rose 3/4 to 33 3/8, Morrison Knudsen gained 2 1/4 to 44 1/8, Foster Wheeler added 3/8 to 18 1/4 and Ameron climbed 2 3/8 to 39 3/4. 

Among engineering firms, CRS Sirrine rose 5/8 to 34 1/4 on the Big Board and four others rallied on the American Stock Exchange: Jacobs Engineering Group, which gained 1 1/8 to 25 3/8, Greiner Engineering, which rose 3 1/2 to 22 1/2; Michael Baker, which added 1 1/4 to 15 1/4, and American Science & Engineering, up 1/2 to 8 1/2. 

Within the building-materials group, Georgia-Pacific climbed 1 1/4 to 58 and Louisiana-Pacific added 1 to 40 3/4 after Merrill Lynch recommended the forest-products issues.
CalMat advanced 2 3/4 to 28 3/4, Lone Star Industries gained 1 3/4 to 29 1/4, Lafarge rose 1 to 19 1/2, Southdown added 5/8 to 24 5/8 and Eljer Industries rose 1 1/4 to 24 7/8. 

Pacific Gas & Electric fell 3/8 to 19 5/8 in Big Board composite trading of 1.7 million shares and Pacific Telesis Group slipped 5/8 to 44 5/8 as the companies worked to restore service to areas affected by the quake. 

Chevron added 1 to 65.
The company, based in San Francisco, said it had to shut down a crude-oil pipeline in the Bay area to check for leaks but added that its refinery in nearby Richmond, Calif., was undamaged. 

Other companies based in the area include Hewlett-Packard, which rose 1/4 to 49; National Semiconductor, which went up 1/4 to 7 5/8, and Genentech, which eased 1/4 to 19 5/8.
None of the firms reported any major damage to facilities as a result of the quake. 

BankAmerica eased 1/2 to 31 7/8 and Wells Fargo lost 1/2 to 81 1/2; the two bank holding companies, based in San Francisco, were forced to curtail some operations due to the temblor.
Among California savings-and-loan stocks, H.F. Ahmanson eased 3/8 to 22 1/4, CalFed slid 3/4 to 24 1/8, Great Western Financial dropped 1/2 to 21 1/4 and Golden West Financial fell 5/8 to 29 1/4. 

UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, swung within a 14-point range during the course of the session before closing at 191 3/4, down 6 1/4, on 2.3 million shares. 

British Airways, a member of the group that had offered $300 a share for UAL in a leveraged buy-out, said it had yet to receive a revised proposal and it was "in no way committed" to the completion of a bid.
Separately, investor Marvin Davis withdrew his backup $300-a-share takeover offer. 

While UAL faltered, AMR, the parent of American Airlines, pulled out of its recent nosedive by rising 3/4 to 74.
The stock had been on the decline since the financing for the UAL buy-out fell through on Friday and developer Donald Trump subsequently withdrew a takeover offer of $120 a share for AMR. Also, AMR was the most active Big Board issue; 2.8 million shares changed hands. 

GTE added 1 1/4 to 65 3/8.
PaineWebber repeated a buy recommendation on the stock and raised its 1990 earnings estimate by 35 cents a share, to $5.10. 

Colgate-Palmolive advanced 1 5/8 to 63 after saying it was comfortable with analysts' projections that third-quarter net income from continuing operations would be between 95 cents and $1.05 a share, up from 69 cents a year ago. 

Springs Industries dropped 1 3/8 to 36.
Analysts at several brokerage firms lowered their 1989 and 1990 earnings estimates on the company after its third-quarter results proved disappointing. 

Trinova third-quarter loss after a charge for a planned restructuring, which will include the closing or downsizing of about 25% of its plants and a work force cut of about 1,500 over three years. 

The Amex Market Value Index snapped a five-session losing streak by rising 2.91 to 378.07.
Volume totaled 12,500,000 shares. 

Carnival Cruise Lines Class A rose 1 1/4 to 22 3/8.
The company, citing market conditions, postponed a $200 million debt offer. 

Control Data Corp. agreed to sell its idle supercomputer manufacturing plant here to Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. for $5.8 million. 

The tentative agreement calls for 3M to use the 115,000-square-foot plant and 19 acres of land for research laboratories.
Control Data has been seeking a buyer for the facility since it folded its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer unit this past April. 

Valley National Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $72.2 million, or $3.65 a share, and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its Arizona real estate holdings. 

The Phoenix-based holding company for Arizona's largest bank said it added $121 million to its allowance for losses on loans and for real estate owned.
The company earned $18.7 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. 

For the nine months, Valley National posted a net loss of $136.4 million, or $6.90 a share.
It had profit of $48.6 million, or $2.46 a share, in the 1988 period.
Valley National had been paying a quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share. 

"The Arizona real estate market continues to be depressed, and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover," James P. Simmons, chairman, said.
The decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is "both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders," he said. 

Valley National said it made the decision on the basis of an "overall assessment of the marketplace" and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators.
The addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of $199.7 million that was announced in June. 

In July, Moody's downgraded $400 million of the company's debt, saying the bank holding company hadn't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second-quarter write-down.
Richard M. Greenwood, Valley National's executive vice president, said then that the company believed the write-downs were "adequate" and didn't plan to increase its reserves again. 

Bruce Hoyt, a banking analyst with Boettcher & Co., a Denver brokerage firm, said Valley National "isn't out of the woods yet." The key will be whether Arizona real estate turns around or at least stabilizes, he said. 

"They've stepped up to the plate to take the write-downs, but when markets head down, a company is always exposed to further negative surprises," Mr. Hoyt said. 

Valley National closed yesterday at $24.25 a share, down $1, in national over-the-counter trading. 

On Wall Street yesterday, northern California's killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck. 

At the opening bell, investors quickly began singling out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the California disaster, including insurers, construction-related companies, refiners and housing lenders.
Brokerage houses jumped in, touting "post-quake demand" stocks, and Kidder, Peabody & Co. set up a toll-free hot line for San Franciscans who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds. 

"Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money," says Tom Gallagher, a senior Oppenheimer & Co. trader.
However, he added, such event-driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information. 

The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as General Re Corp., which rose $2.75 to $86.50, Nac Re Corp., up $2 to $37.75, American International Group Inc., up $3.25 to $102.625, and Cigna Corp., up 87.5 cents to $62.50.
Yesterday, the brokerage firm Conning & Co. said insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates, ending their long price wars. 

Before this bullish theory surfaced, some insurance stocks initially fell, indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money.
In fact, Fireman's Fund Corp., which ended the day off 50 cents to $36.50, said earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth-quarter profit. 

On the prospect for rebuilding northern California, investors bid up cement-makers Calmat Co., up $2.75 to $28.75, and Lone Star Industries Inc., up $1.75 to $29.25.
Bridge and road builders had a field day, including Kasler Corp., up $2.125 to $9.875, Guy F. Atkinson Co., up 87.5 to $61.875, and Morrison Knudsen Corp., which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday, up $2.25 to $44.125.
Fluor Corp., a construction engineering firm, gained 75 cents to $33.375.
But home-building stocks were a mixed bag. 

Timber stocks got a big boost.
Georgia Pacific Corp., up $1.25 to $58, and Maxxam Inc., up $3 to $43.75, both reported strong profits.
Merrill Lynch & Co. touted Georgia-Pacific, Louisiana Pacific Corp. and Willamette Industries Inc. as the best post-quake plywood plays. 

Other gainers were companies with one or more undamaged California refineries.
Tosco Corp. jumped $1.125 to $20.125 and Chevron Corp., despite a temporary pipeline shutdown, rose $1 to $65. 

Meanwhile, shares of some big housing lenders got hit, on the likelihood that the lenders' collateral -- people's homes -- suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value.
Wells Fargo & Co. fell 50 cents to $81.50, and BankAmerica Corp. fell 50 cents to $31.875.
Some California thrift stocks also fell, including Golden West Financial Corp. and H.F. Ahmanson & Co., which reported lower earnings yesterday. 

"Property values didn't go up in California yesterday," says one money manager. 

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. fell 37.5 cents to $19.625.
One of its power generators was damaged, though the company said there won't be any financial impact. 

Pacific Telesis Group lost 62.5 cents to $44.625.
A computer failure delayed its earnings announcement, and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines. 

Heavy construction, property-casualty insurance and forest products were among the best performing industry groups in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index yesterday. 

The Treasury plans to raise $700 million in new cash with the sale Tuesday of about $10 billion in two-year notes to redeem $9.29 billion in maturing notes. 

The offering will be dated Oct. 31 and mature Oct. 31, 

Tenders for the notes, available in minimum $5,000 denominations, must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches. 

Whitbread & Co. put its spirits division up for sale, triggering a scramble among global groups for the British company's brands. 

Whitbread already has been approached by "about half a dozen" companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business, a spokesman said.
Analysts expect the spirits operations and some California vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about #500 million ($788.8 million). 

Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin, the No. 2 imported gin in the U.S., and Laphroaig single-malt whiskey.
Also for sale are Buckingham Wile Co., which distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U.S., and Whitbread's Atlas Peak Vineyards in California's Napa Valley. 

Beefeater alone is worth as much as #300 million, analysts said.
Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for #174.5 million. 

That purchase represented an attempt by Whitbread, a venerable British brewer, to become a major player in the global liquor business.
But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry.
Now, it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations. 

For rival liquor companies, the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands. "It's not very often something like this comes up," said Ron Littleboy, a liquor company analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London. 

"The division will be sold off quite rapidly," predicted Neill Junor, an analyst at London brokers County NatWest WoodMac.
Among possible buyers, Grand Metropolitan PLC might find Beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio.
Grand Met owns Bombay gin, the No. 3 imported gin in the U.S.; rival Guinness PLC has the No. 1 imported brand, Tanqueray.
The Whitbread spirits auction "is an extremely interesting development . . . and naturally we'll be considering it carefully," a Grand Met spokesman said. 

Guinness, which owns several leading whiskey brands plus Gordon's gin, the world's No. 1 gin, is considered less likely to bid for the Whitbread spirits.
A Guinness spokesman declined to comment. 

Two other global liquor giants, Canada's Seagram Co. and Britain's Allied-Lyons PLC, also are possible buyers.
Seagram's gin is the world's No. 2 gin brand, but the company doesn't own any of the major gin brands imported in the U.S. Allied-Lyons, while powerful in whiskey, doesn't own any major white-spirit brands. "We will certainly have to take a look at" the Whitbread spirits business, an Allied-Lyons spokesman said. "We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio." A Seagram spokesman in New York wouldn't comment. 

Smaller liquor companies, such as Brown-Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S., also are likely to be interested.
Such companies "are increasingly being left behind" in the global liquor business, says Nomura's Mr. Littleboy.
In New York, a spokesman for American Brands wouldn't comment.
Brown-Forman, a Louisville, Ky. distiller, also declined to comment. 

Whitbread's wine, spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of #35.4 million on sales of #315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25.
The company, which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests, didn't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell.
But analysts estimate their trading profit at #30 million.
Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of #223.2 million, on sales of #2.26 billion. 

Whitbread's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry.
Earlier this year, the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry.
British brewers currently own thousands of pubs, which in turn sell only the breweries' beer and soft drinks.
Under new rules, many of the country's pubs would become "free houses," selling beers of their choice. 

Whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests, in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses.
The company, which last month paid #50.7 million for regional British brewer Boddington Group PLC, has about 13% of the British beer market.
Whitbread also owns the license to brew and distribute Heineken and Stella Artois beers in Britain. 

In addition, Whitbread intends to focus on its newer hotel, liquor store and restaurant businesses in Europe and North America.
In Britain, those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with PepsiCo Inc. of the country's Pizza Hut chain.
In Canada and the U.S., Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants. 

Focusing on beer, restaurants and hotels means "we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively," Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's managing director, said in a statement.
The spirits business "would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players." 

Whitbread also announced that Mr. Jarvis, who is 48, will become the company's chief executive March 1.
At that time Sam Whitbread, the company's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder, will retire from executive duties.
He will retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman. 

Friday's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here. 

Petco Options, an options trading firm owned by the family of the deceased former Chicago Board of Trade chairman Ralph Peters, is getting out of the trade clearing, or processing and guaranteeing, business after sustaining a multimillion dollar loss Friday, options industry officials said. 

Nearly 75 options traders on the Chicago Board Options Exchange who cleared trades through Petco, including a handful of traders who lost between $500,000 to $1 million themselves as a result of Friday's debacle, are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms, CBOE members said. 

Timothy Vincent, Petco chief executive officer, confirmed that Petco was withdrawing from the clearing business. "The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business, and after Monday they felt they didn't want to be exposed any more," he said.
He added that Petco remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market's rapid plunge Friday and Monday's rebound.
A CBOE spokeswoman declined comment on Petco. 

Over the weekend Fossett Corp., another options trading firm, transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to First Options of Chicago, a unit of Continental Bank Corp., because it couldn't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday's market slide.
The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday.
The CBOE, American Stock Exchange, Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett, owner of Fossett, joined in putting up $50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options. 

The head of another small options clearing firm, who asked not to be identified, said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business. 

Prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s, most trading firms clustered around the LaSalle Street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next.
Most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most Wall Street securities firms. 

Mr. Peters, a LaSalle Street legend among the post-World War II generation of commodity traders, was rumored to have amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in May. 

In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American, New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange. 

The decision, which affects millions of dollars of trading positions, was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday's earthquake.
The SEC, faced with a major squeeze on options positions, said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow. 

SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange, guaranteeing the liquidity of the market. 

Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American, New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE, where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options.
The Big Board said carpenters quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate 40 traders from the Pacific exchange.
In addition, specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for market-making in Pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges. 

Trading was light on the Pacific Stock Exchange yesterday, with workers at the exchange's main floor in San Francisco struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage. 

The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading.
The Pacific exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues, including highly active Hilton Hotels Corp., which is listed on the Big Board.
Investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow. 

But professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown wouldn't be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for several days. "I've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options, because they are guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corp.," said Michael Schwartz, a senior registered options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. 

The SEC reassigned trading in the options, however, to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options. 

While the exchange's equities floor in San Francisco remained open on a limited basis, orders were being routed and executed in Los Angeles.
Workers could dial out, but they couldn't receive telephone calls. "It's a very uncertain situation right now," said Navin Vyas, administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange, which has daily volume of about 10 million shares. 

Because the exchange's computer was rerouting orders to the exchange's trading operations in Los Angeles, "business is as usual" Mr. Vyas said. "If one city is down, the other can take over." 

Meanwhile, the brokerage firms in San Francisco were trying to cope.
Charles Daggs, chairman and chief executive officer of Sutro & Co., said traders came to work at 5 a.m. PDT -- many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions -- but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company's two main facilities there.
That should happen by today, he said. 

Traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows, despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls.
Also, most of the telecommunications equipment was out.
The traders were executing municipal bond, mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm, Tucker Anthony Inc., which is also owned by John Hancock Freedom Securities but is based in New York. "We are having a regular day.
Volume is down out of San Francisco, but not out of the 11 outlying offices," Mr. Daggs added.
Sutro's Oakland office executed orders through the Sacramento office, which wasn't affected by the quake. 

Others, like Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., which has eight offices in the San Francisco area, set up an 800 number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help. 

At Kidder, Peabody & Co. 's Sacramento branch, Manager Janet White received calls yesterday morning from workers in San Francisco who offered to work in Sacramento.
Then she discovered that Quotron Systems Inc. 's Sacramento lines were down, because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through San Francisco.
So the Kidder brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks. 

At Quotron, the company's National Call-In Center, which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo, assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders.
The company dispatched as many as 200 people in the San Francisco area to do the work, though most of the rerouting was done by computer. 

Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown San Francisco, while just parts of Oakland and San Jose were knocked out.
But Dale Irvine, director of the emergency center, said service was being restored to outlying San Francisco areas. 

In Chicago yesterday, Options Clearing confirmed that it guarantees the Pacific exchange options.
The firm also will permit its members and the public "to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange" even if the exchange is closed, said Wayne Luthringshausen, chairman of Options Clearing. (Put options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to sell a financial instrument at a specified price, while call options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy a financial instrument at a specified price). 

Investors and traders in Pacific exchange options "are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument," Mr. Luthringshausen said. "We are seeing such exercises today, in fact." 

Northrop Corp. 's third-quarter net income fell 25% to $21.5 million, or 46 cents a share, while General Dynamics Corp. reported nearly flat earnings of $76.5 million, or $1.83 a share. 

Los Angeles-based Northrop recorded an 8.2% decline in sales as B-2 Stealth bomber research-and-development revenue continued to ebb and high costs on some other programs cut into profit.
The aerospace concern earned $28.8 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales in the latest period were $1.25 billion, down from $1.36 billion in the 1988 quarter. 

At St. Louis-based General Dynamics, sales rose 10% to $2.52 billion from $2.29 billion.
It earned $76.4 million, or $1.82 a share, in the 1988 quarter.
General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments, an earnings recovery in submarine operations, and higher military aircraft sales. 

Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Northrop shares closed at $21.125, off 25 cents.
General Dynamics closed at $54.875, up 50 cents. 

Northrop, which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development, said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago.
Among them were the ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures system for the F-15 fighter.
Northrop's interest expense also soared to $35 million from $17 million a year ago.
It said debt remained at the $1.22 billion that has prevailed since early 1989, although that compared with $911 million at Sept. 30, 1988. 

The backlog of undelivered orders at Northrop on Sept. 30 was $4.68 billion, down from $5.16 billion a year earlier. 

For the nine months, Northrop reported a net loss of $46.9 million, or $1 a share, compared with profit of $190.3 million, or $4.05 a share, in 1988.
Sales dipped 3.6% to $3.92 billion from $4.07 billion. 

At General Dynamics, factors reducing earnings in the military aircraft segment included higher levels of cost-sharing in development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter, and the high cost of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter.
F-16 deliveries also have fallen "slightly behind schedule," although a return to the previous schedule is expected in 1990, the company said. 

Backlog at General Dynamics rose to $16.5 billion from $15.8 billion.
Its interest expense surged to $21.5 million from $12.4 million.
For the nine months, General Dynamics earned $210.3 million, or $5.03 a share, up marginally from $208.8 million, or $4.97 a share, on a 4.9% rise in sales to $7.41 billion from $7.06 billion. 

Tandy Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of Datatronic AB of Stockholm for cash.
The amount wasn't disclosed. 

The electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between $100 million and $200 million for Datatronic's Victor microcomputer and Micronic hand-held computer subsidiaries.
In addition, Tandy will acquire rights to the Victor and Micronic names for computers.
During 1988, the Datatronic subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of $200 million. 

The transaction will give Tandy a well-known European computer brand that includes 2,700 dealers and distributors marketing to medium-sized business and educational institutions. 

Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals, the company said. 

Mellon Bank Corp. said directors authorized the buy-back of as many as 250,000 common shares. 

The bank holding company said stock repurchased will be used to meet requirements for the company's benefit plans. 

Mellon has 36.6 million shares outstanding. 

General Dynamics Corp. was awarded contracts totaling $589 million for one Navy Trident submarine and for Air Force research on the National Aerospace plane. 

Grumman Corp. won a $58.9 million Navy contract for 12 F-14 aircraft. 

Raytheon Co. was issued a $19.2 million Air Force contract for support of the Milstar communications satellite. 

McDonnell Douglas Corp. got a $12.5 million Air Force contract for support work on the National Aerospace plane. 

Many in Washington say President Bush will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs.
We have a better idea: Dismantle HUD to pay for the war on drugs. 

Housing and Urban Development's budget is $17 billion.
From what we and the nation have been reading, the money isn't being spent very well.
The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods.
If that takes money, take it away from this discredited federal department. 

But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind.
Instead, they're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the HUD scandal. 

This month, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at HUD. No doubt many of his ideas are worthy, but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently.
Congress is unlikely to go even that far. 

Last week, Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members.
They were appalled, for instance, that he wanted to target more of the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious "discretionary" funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies. 

These development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages.
They also give those in Congress political credit for bringing home the pork, and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar. 

Rep. Oakar, a Democrat from Cleveland, wants a $6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
She says it'd create 600 jobs and bring Cleveland tourist revenue.
HUD says the project doesn't qualify, and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money. 

At the hearing, Rep. Oakar started wailing about "phoney baloney regulations" that would stand between her and "housing for downtown Cleveland." Rep. Chalmers Wylie, an Ohio Republican, rallied to the cause: "I think the gentlelady is making an important statement.
The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there's something wrong, I think is most unfortunate." 

We're sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with HUD and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with HUD.
Our view is that given Congress's attitude toward HUD, the place probably is beyond reform. 

For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities.
In the process HUD has wasted untold billions, created slums and invited corruption. 

Much of HUD's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class.
That includes the CDBG funds and the Federal Housing Administration, which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be $4 billion in the hole.
Selling the FHA's loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses. 

Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor, and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units.
The rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods. 

Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones.
Even suburban Prince George's County, Md., reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year, most of them drug-related.
Innocent bystanders often are the victims.
A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle.
A three-year-old Brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer. 

Decent life in the inner cities won't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs.
Until then, the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted. 

It's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there.
No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged.
Having seen the hypocrisy with which Congress has addressed the HUD scandals, we disagree.
It's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine HUD has become and channel the resources into the drug war. 

As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday's devastating earthquake, NBC News began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake's initial moments. 

"In terms of coverage, it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes," said Eric Premner, president for broadcasting of King Broadcasting Co., which owns the NBC affiliate in Seattle, Wash. 

While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck -- NBC News was unable to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake. 

"I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster," said Mr. Premner. "So before I start to be really critical of NBC, I would like to know more about what happened." 

There were no complaints from affiliates of CBS Inc. and Cable News Network, a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. 

But that was not the case at NBC News, which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories.
Last summer, the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in China. 

"I was not pleased with the slow start, and neither was NBC News," said Guy Hempel, general manager of NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville, Ky. 

A spokesman for National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., said the network was "looking into what happened." The stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday, including a special five-hour edition of "Today." 

Don Browne, director of news at NBC News, said in an interview that "we couldn't get a signal out of San Francisco.
We were out of the box.
It was horrible.
The comment we're hearing is that we were slow out of the box, but beat everyone else in the stretch." 

NBC broadcast throughout the entire night and did not go off the air until noon yesterday. 

The quake postponed the third and fourth games of the World Series.
In place of the games, ABC said it planned to broadcast next week's episodes of its prime-time Wednesday and Thursday lineups, except for a one-hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last night.
The series is scheduled to resume Tuesday evening in San Francisco. 

"There are no commercials to make up for since we're going to eventually broadcast the World Series," said a network spokesman. 

The government moved aggressively to open the spigots of federal aid for victims of the California earthquake, but its reservoir of emergency funds must be replenished soon if the aid is to continue. 

President Bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven Northern California counties.
The declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing, grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses. 

In addition, an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development prepared to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left homeless, the Agriculture Department was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake victims, and the Pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic. 

But the pool of federal emergency-relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up Hurricane Hugo, and Congress will be under pressure to allocate more money quickly.
In Hugo's wake, Congress allocated $1.1 billion in relief funds, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said $273 million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake. 

Now, though, enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief. "That obviously means that we won't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us, and we will have to consider appropriate requests for follow-on funding," Mr. Fitzwater said.
The federal government isn't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it.
But Mr. Fitzwater said, "There will be, I think quite obviously, a very large amount of money required from all levels of government." 

In Congress, lawmakers already are looking for ways to add relief funds.
Money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which coordinates federal disaster relief.
More likely, relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that Congress is to begin considering next week. 

But it isn't just Washington's relief dollars that are spread thin; its relief manpower also is stretched.
FEMA still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of Hugo, and spokesman Russell Clanahan acknowledged that "we're pretty thin." Mr. Clanahan says FEMA now possibly may have the heaviest caseload in its history. 

To further complicate relief efforts, the privately funded American Red Cross also finds itself strapped for funds after its big Hugo operation. "It's been a bad month money-wise and every other way," said Sally Stewart, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross. "It just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget." The Red Cross has opened 30 shelters in the Bay area, serving 5,000 people.
Twenty-five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states. 

All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to California won't be determined until state officials make specific requests to FEMA, agency officials said.
And in the confusion after the earthquake, "the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area," said Carl Suchocki, a FEMA spokesman. 

Still, some aid is moving westward from Washington almost immediately.
HUD officials said they will make available as many as 100 Bay area houses that are under HUD loans but now are vacant after the houses have been inspected to ensure they are sound.
Additional housing vouchers and certificates will be made available, officials said, and some housing and community-development funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use. 

Another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief -- the Internal Revenue Service -- moved quickly as well.
The IRS said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake's devastation.
The agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days. 

And the Treasury said residents of the San Francisco area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they haven't held them for the minimum six-month period. 

One advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the San Francisco Bay area, facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers.
Even before the full extent of the devastation was known, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the Pentagon and prepare to respond to various FEMA requests for assistance. 

By yesterday afternoon, Air Force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies, physicians, communications equipment and FEMA personnel to California.
A military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior Bush administration officials to survey the damage.
And the Pentagon said dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert "awaiting orders to move emergency supplies." 

Two Air Force facilities near Sacramento, and Travis Air Force Base, 50 miles northeast of San Francisco, were designated to serve as medical-airlift centers.
Some victims also were treated at the Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Naval Hospital in Oakland.
In addition, 20 military police from the Presidio, a military base in San Francisco, are assisting with traffic control, and a Navy ship was moved from a naval station at Treasure Island near the Bay Bridge to San Francisco to help fight fires. 

To help residents in Northern California rebuild, FEMA intends to set up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with 400 to 500 workers from various agencies, said Robert Volland, chief of the agency's individual assistance division.
At these offices, earthquake victims will be helped in filling out a one-page form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as home-improvement loans and to repair houses. 

And federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to rebuild the area's severely damaged road system.
The Federal Highway Administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters.
The account currently has $220 million.
And though federal law dictates that only $100 million can be disbursed from that fund in any one state per disaster, administration officials expect Congress to move in to authorize spending more now in California. 

To get that money, states must go through an elaborate approval process, but officials expect red tape to be cut this time. 

Keith Mulrooney, special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator Thomas Larson, also said that after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in Southern California, the state set tougher standards for bridges, and with federal aid, began a program to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards.
The first phase of the program has been completed, but two other phases are continuing. 

The two major structures that failed Tuesday night, he said, were both built well before the 1971 earthquake -- the San Francisco Bay Bridge, completed in the 1930s, and the section of I-880, built in the 1950s.
The I-880 section had completed the first phase of the retrofitting.

With airline deals in a tailspin, legendary Wall Street trader Michael Steinhardt could have trouble parachuting out of USAir Group, traders say. 

Only a week ago, when airline buy-out fever was already winding down, Mr. Steinhardt was engaged in a duel with USAir.
He was threatening to take over the carrier, after spending an estimated $167 million to build an 8.4% USAir stake for his investment clients.
The would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat, which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for USAir, or for his own stake. 

In fighting USAir, Mr. Steinhardt was pitted against another investor, billionnaire Warren Buffett, who bought into USAir to help fend off Mr. Steinhardt.
Mr. Buffett's firm, Berkshire Hathaway, holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than Mr. Steinhardt's firm, Steinhardt Partners. 

Now, in the wake of UAL's troubles in financing its buy-out, the airline raiding game has been grounded.
Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts' estimated buy-out price of $80 a share, Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him $45, on average, but yesterday closed at 40 1/2, up 1/4, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

"It doesn't make sense to parachute out at this price," Mr. Steinhardt says, though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends USAir managers' "operating skills." 

At the current price, the USAir holding represents 9% of all the assets that Mr. Steinhardt manages.
A week ago, USAir stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in USA Today that Mr. Steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier, though takeover speculators say they were skeptical. 

"If USAir is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52, the market was saying Steinhardt's presence wasn't worth anything, in terms of getting a deal done," says a veteran takeover speculator. 

Traders say this all goes to show that even the smartest money manager can get infected with crowd passions.
In trying to raid USAir, Mr. Steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor, and ran into snags.
Moreover, unlike Mr. Buffett, who often holds big stakes in companies for years, Mr. Steinhardt hasn't in the past done much long-term investing. 

Mr. Steinhardt, who runs about $1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners, made his name as a gunslinging trader, moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment clients.
Meanwhile, his big losses, for instance in 1987's crash, generally have been trading losses. 

So, some see a special irony in the fact that Mr. Steinhardt, the trader, now is encumbered with a massive, illiquid airline holding.
Analysts say USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once.
As a result, Mr. Steinhardt must reconcile himself to selling USAir at a loss, or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment. 

"Long-term investing -- that's not Steinhardt's style," chuckles an investor who once worked at Steinhardt Partners. "He doesn't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole," adds another Steinhardt Partners alumnus. 

In recent days, traders say USAir has been buying its own shares, as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir shares, though the carrier won't discuss its buy-back program. 

If USAir stepped up its share purchases, that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out, says Timothy Pettee, a Merrill Lynch analyst.
But USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt, he adds. 

In 1987, USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled when Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the carrier.
Mr. Icahn, a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt, eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear, Stearns.
Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route.
He confers big trading commissions on Wall Street firms.
However, with airline stocks cratering, he might not get a very good price for his shares, traders say. 

Especially galling for Mr. Steinhardt, say people close to him, is that USAir's Mr. Colodny won't even take his telephone calls.
While USAir isn't considered absolutely takeover-proof, its defenses, including the sale in August of a 12% stake in the company to Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, are pretty strong. 

USAir's deal with Mr. Buffett "wasn't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy," Mr. Steinhardt says.
Since last April, the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir, as he bought and sold the company's stock.
Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company's managers, and to stir interest in the stock.
But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company. 

USAir and Mr. Buffett won't talk about Mr. Steinhardt at all. 

Analysts say USAir has great promise.
By the second half of 1990, USAir stock could hit 60, says Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
She thinks traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to 35. 

But meanwhile, USAir is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest Piedmont Airlines, which it acquired.
Moreover, some investors think a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in coming months. 

However, Mr. Steinhardt says he's "comfortable holding USAir as an investment." While he has bought and sold some USAir shares in recent days, he says that contrary to rumors, he hasn't tried to unload his holding.
Mr. Steinhardt adds that he bought USAir stock earlier this year as "part of a fundamental investment in the airline group." 

In 1989, Mr. Steinhardt says he made money trading in Texas Air, AMR and UAL. Overall, his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20%, he adds. 

Does Mr. Steinhardt regret his incursion into the takeover-threat game?
People close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat. "I don't think you'll find I'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style," Mr. Steinhardt says. 

Bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply. 

Early yesterday, bonds rose as investors rushed to buy Treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive California earthquake.
For example, some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies, which face massive damage claims, would get hit hard.
But when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose instead, bonds drifted lower. 

With stocks not a major focus, "we're waiting for the next guiding light," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc. "If the stock market tremors are behind us, then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine" where interest rates are heading. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which jumped 3/8 point, or about $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, during the first hour of trading, ended little changed.
Interest rates barely budged from Tuesday's levels. 

Most junk bonds, which have been battered in recent weeks, continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher.
But some so-called high-quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues to raise cash.
RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 's 14.7% bonds due 2009 fell one point.
Other RJR issues fell between 1/2 point and 1 1/2 point. 

In the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds, Continental Airlines said it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering. 

Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., slashed the size of its note offering from $150 million to $71 million.
The move had been widely expected.
In the multipart offering, the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes. 

A Continental spokeswoman said the notes may be offered at a later date. "This was not a do-or-die deal," she said. "I think this is a market that required some level of security.
It did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market." 

Investors have been speculating for weeks about the market's ability to place the $7 billion to $10 billion of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by year end. 

Supply troubles were also on the minds of Treasury investors yesterday, who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week. 

"We're being bombarded by new Treasury and agency debt offerings," said William Sullivan Jr., director of money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels." 

In addition to the $15.6 billion of Treasury bills to be sold at next week's regular Monday auction, the government will sell $10 billion of new two-year Treasury notes.
And Resolution Funding Corp. said late yesterday that it will sell $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday.
Refcorp is the financing unit of Resolution Trust Corp., a new government agency created to rescue the nation's troubled thrifts.
Its securities have been dubbed "bailout bonds" by traders.
In when-issued trading, the two-year Treasurys had a yield of about 7.88%. 

In the municipal market, all eyes were on California debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of Tuesday's earthquake. 

But traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of California state and local municipal debt. 

"There are certain bonds traders refer to as `earthquake' bonds because the (issuers) are on top of the San Andreas fault," said Zane Mann, editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor, a newsletter for investors.
Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield, an extra premium for the earthquake risk, they weren't materially affected. 

But some bond market analysts said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims. 

"Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct San Francisco," said Charles Lieberman, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as California is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities. 

A report issued late yesterday by Standard & Poor's Corp. concluded the quake won't cause "wide-scale credit deterioration" for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of Northern California affected by the quake. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading. 

The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 100 29/32 to yield 8.03%, compared with 100 28/32 to yield 8.04% Tuesday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at a price of 99 26/32 to yield 8%, compared with 99 25/32 to yield 8.01%. 

Short-term rates were little changed. 

Corporate Issues 

Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1/4 point lower. 

The Continental junk bond offering, underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., was the only new issue priced yesterday.
In the four-part offering, the $71 million of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield 13.75% to 15.75%. 

Municipals 

Municipal bonds ended about 1/8 to 3/8 point lower, hurt by the circulation of two "bid-wanted" lists totaling $655 million. 

Chemical Securities Inc. is acting as agent for the seller. 

Meanwhile, some California issues were down a touch more than the broad market, but traders said there hadn't been much investor selling because of the quake. 

But New York City general obligation bonds came under selling pressure.
Traders said a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale yesterday, pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage point.
Traders said investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city's finances and are nervous ahead of the Nov. 7 election. 

Washington, D.C., topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of $200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes. 

In late trading, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was off 1/4 point at 98 bid.
The yield was 7.35%, up 0.01 percentage point. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities ended little changed after light dealings. 

There was no appreciable market impact from the California earthquake. 

Dealers said there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake-related claims, but no selling materialized. 

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association, two dominant issuers of mortgage securities, have a sizable amount of California home loans in their mortgagebacked pools. 

But their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans they purchase.
And because Northern California home prices are so high, loans from the region often are too large to be included in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pools. 

Meanwhile, Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery ended at 97 29/32, unchanged.
Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 97 4/32, down 1/32. 

In derivative markets, Fannie Mae issued two $400 million real estate mortgage investment conduits backed by its 9% securities. 

Foreign Bonds 

British government bonds, or gilts, ended moderately lower as equities there recovered from Tuesday's drop. 

The Treasury's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 11/32 to 111 31/32 to yield 10.08%, while the 12% notes due 1995 were down 7/32 to 103 22/32 to yield 11.04%. 

Traders said today may be an anxious day for the market.
Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is scheduled to give the annual "Mansion House" address to the financial community. 

The chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes.
Economists don't expect any such changes in this year's address, given Mr. Lawson's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently. 

Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds retreated in quiet trading, stymied by the dollar's resiliency.
Japan's bellwether 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.75 to yield 5.315%. 

In West Germany, investors stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction.
The government's 7% issue due October 1999 fell 0.05 point to 99.90 to yield 7.01%. 

A group of investors, including Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications Corp. and Sasea Holding S.A., have agreed to buy 76.66% of Odeon Finanziaria, a financially troubled Italian TV station. 

Florio Fiorini, managing director of Geneva-based Sasea, said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station, "but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating.
It's sort of a Chapter 11 situation," he added, referring to the U.S. bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure. 

Milan-based Odeon, which draws about 3% of Italian TV viewers, has debt of 250 billion lire ($181.9 million), Mr. Fiorini said.
He added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out, but that Pathe will take 50% of Odeon, Rome film producer Bruno Lucisano will take 10% and the remaining 16.66%, currently owned by Sasea, will eventually be sold to other investors.
Calisto Tanzi, Odeon's owner, will retain his 23.34% stake. 

Italy's Supreme Court this year ordered Parliament to write a law that will regulate media ownership. "We think that it's going to be far more favorable to own a station before the law is passed than to try to buy one afterward," Mr. Fiorini said. 

Philip Morris Cos. posted a 20% jump in third-quarter profit on a 45% revenue increase, reflecting strength in the company's cigarette, food and brewing businesses. 

Net income rose to $748 million, or 81 cents a share, from the year-earlier $621 million, or 67 cents a share.
Per-share figures have been adjusted for a 4-for-1 stock split paid earlier this month.
The New York-based tobacco, food and beer concern said revenue increased to $11.25 billion from $7.74 billion. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Philip Morris closed at $43.375, up 12.5 cents. 

Philip Morris disclosed little detailed information about performance by major business lines except to say that most, including Philip Morris U.S.A., Kraft General Foods and Miller Brewing Co., posted increased revenues. 

For the nine months, net increased 4.4% to $2.08 billion, or $2.25 a share, from $2 billion, which included $273 million reflecting the effect of an accounting change. 

Bank Building & Equipment Corp. of America, which previously said accounting discrepancies its auditors uncovered would hurt earnings and require restatement of earlier results, increased its projections of the negative fiscal impact, and said it was exploring the company's sale. 

Bank Building, which builds and equips banks, had announced it would restate the first-three quarters of this fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31. 

On Oct. 5, the company estimated after-tax effects on the year's earnings would be "at least" $1.3 million.
Yesterday, the company said the negative after-tax effect on earnings for the year will be about $3.3 million.
For the nine months ended July 31, Bank Building had a net loss of $1 million, on revenue of $66.5 million. 

Bank Building, which expects to report a fourth-quarter loss, said it engaged advisers to "explore financial alternatives for the company including the possible sale of the company or one or more of its units." 

Company auditors are continuing their review, and final restated figures aren't yet available.
Bank Building earlier said the restatement is necessitated by "certain errors in recording receivables and payables" at its Loughman Cabinet division.
That division's manager has been fired. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Bank Building closed at $4 a share, down 62.5 cents.

Betty Lombardi is a mild-mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural Hunterdon County, N.J.
But put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless. 

If Colgate toothpaste offers a tempting money-saving coupon, she'll cross Crest off her shopping list without a second thought.
Never mind that her husband prefers Crest.
Some weeks when her supermarket runs a double-coupon promotion, she boasts that she shaves $22 off her bill. 

Money isn't the only thing that makes her dump once favorite brands.
After she heard about the artery-clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies, she dropped Pepperidge Farm and started buying brands free of such oils. "I always thought Pepperidge Farm was tasty and high quality," Mrs. Lombardi says. "But I don't want any of that oil for my grandkids." (Pepperidge Farm says it can't tell exactly how many customers it has lost, but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end.) 

Clearly, people like Mrs. Lombardi are giving marketers fits.
She represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices, nutritional and environmental concerns, and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty. 

While brand loyalty is far from dead, marketing experts say it has eroded during the 1980s.
Marketers themselves are partly to blame: They've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising.
What's more, a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands, many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other. 

"Marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use" of promotions, contends Joe Plummer, an executive vice president at the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles ad agency. "Without some real product improvements, it's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back." 

The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use.
For the survey, Peter D. Hart Research Associates asked some 2,000 consumers, including Mrs. Lombardi, whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty.
More than half the users of 17 of the 25 products included in the survey said they're brand switchers. 

Overall, 12% of consumers aren't brand loyal for any of the 25 product categories.
About 47% are loyal for one to five of the products.
Only 2% are brand loyal in 16 to 20 of the categories, and no one is loyal for more than 20 types of products. 

For such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes, devotion to a single brand was quite low, with fewer than 30% saying they usually buy the same brand.
Only for cigarettes, mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than 60% of users say they typically stick with the same brand. 

People tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors, such as cigarettes and ketchup.
Kathie Huff, a respondent in the Journal survey from Spokane, Wash., says her husband is adamant about eating only Hunt's ketchup.
He simply can't stomach the taste of Heinz, she says.
The 31-year-old homemaker adds, "The only other thing I'm really loyal to is my Virginia Slims cigarettes.
Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me, and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale." 

Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes, perfume and beer.
People often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising conveys, whether that's macho Marlboro cigarettes or Cher's Uninhibited perfume. 

Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries.
Only 23% of trash-bag users in the Journal survey usually buy the same brand, and just 29% of battery buyers stick to one brand. 

Underwear scored a middling 36% in brand loyalty, but consumer researchers say that's actually quite high for such a mundane product. "In the past, you just wore Fruit of the Loom and didn't care," says Peter Kim, U.S. director of consumer behavior research for the J. Walter Thompson ad agency. "The high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women." 

He believes there's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty.
What loyalty there is to gas brands, he believes, is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service stations. 

Brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the Journal survey.
Nearly one-fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand loyalty for more than 10 of the 25 products in the survey; only 9% of those age 18 to 29 have such strong allegiance. 

Higher-income people also tend to be more brand loyal these days, the Journal survey and other research studies indicate.
Marketers speculate that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and don't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price.
An established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality, if not always the best value for the money.
It's sort of loyalty by default. 

Meanwhile, "the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal," says Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of the ad agency FCB/Leber Katz Partners. "They're buying whatever's cheaper." 

The biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game: How those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boomers will behave as they move into middle age.
They grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far.
But now that they're settling down and raising families, might they also show more stability in their brand choices? 

Mr. Kim of J. Walter Thompson doesn't think so.
He believes baby boomers will continue to be selective in their brand loyalties. "Earlier generations were brand loyal across categories," he says, "but boomers tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water, but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances." 

While not as brand loyal as in the past, consumers today don't buy products capriciously, either.
Rather, they tend to have a set of two or three favorites.
Sometimes, they'll choose Ragu spaghetti sauce; other times, it will be Prego. 

Advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands.
If a more absorbent Pampers hits the market, you can be sure a new and improved Huggies won't be far behind.
The BBDO Worldwide ad agency studied "brand parity" and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories, particularly credit cards, paper towels, dry soups and snack chips. 

"When there's a clutter of brands, consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves, 'All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy, '" says Karen Olshan, a senior vice president at BBDO. "Too often, advertising imagery hasn't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer." 

But given such strong brand disloyalty, some marketers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising.
A small but growing number of companies are also trying to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct-marketing ploys as catalogs, magazines and membership clubs for brand users. 

While discount promotions are essential for most brands, some companies concede they went overboard in shifting money from advertising to coupons, refunds and other sales incentives. 

Some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the residual impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years.
But most companies are too afraid to take that chance.
And perhaps with good reason.
Says Clayt Wilhite, president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency's U.S. division, "Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement, brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser." 

Consider, for example, what happened to Maxwell House coffee.
The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business.
But since returning to advertising, Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers. 

"Now, Philip Morris {Kraft General Foods' parent company} is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House," says Dick Mayer, president of the General Foods USA division. "Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee, we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it." 

Campbell Soup Co., for one, has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands. "The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000," says Tony Adams, the company's vice president for marketing research. "The best odds are with your core franchise.
Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week, and we'd like to increase that." 

So Campbell is talking to its "brand enthusiasts," probing their psychological attachment to its soup.
In one consumer focus group, a fan declared that, "Campbell's soup is like getting a hug from a friend." That helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising slogan: "A warm hug from Campbell's."

Two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to hinder leveraged buy-outs by raising the price tags of such deals by as much as 10%. 

Wall Street is seething over the rules, which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most LBOs.
The provisions, in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate, could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s, some tax experts and investment bankers argue.
Indeed, some investment bankers have already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules. 

Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous Senate version of one of the provisions. 

At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs.
Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value, with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder.
Under current rules, that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt. 

The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction, and label any such debt as equity, which isn't deductible.
The less-rigorous Senate version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years. 

"You see these in just about every LBO," said Robert Willens, senior vice president in charge of tax issues at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. "It becomes a source of cash" for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and doesn't have to repay the debt for several years. 

Typically, Mr. Willens estimates, this type of debt makes up 15% to 20% of the financing for LBOs.
These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc., Storer Communications Inc. and Kroger Co. 

A second provision passed by the Senate and House would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years.
For example, if a company posted a loss of $100 million from buy-out interest payments, the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a refund from the tax it paid from 1986 through 1989, when it may have been a profitable public company. 

But that rule is being virtually overlooked by Wall Street, which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue. "Prices for LBOs have to come down if you don't have that feature," argued Lawrence Schloss, managing director for merchant banking at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York. 

Several Wall Street officials say the proposed legislation already is having an impact.
An investment group led by Chicago's Pritzker family recently lowered a $3.35 billion bid for American Medical International, Beverly Hills, Calif., because of the threat of the legislation. 

Moreover, one investment banker, who requested anonymity, said his firm didn't raise the ante for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that wasn't concerned about the financing provision. "We would have paid more if we thought that law wasn't going to pass," he said. 

One possible solution for Wall Street is to increase the equity part of the transaction -- that is, give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments.
That would force the buy-out firm and the target company's management to reduce their level of ownership. "The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through," said Peter C. Canellos, tax partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. 

Another solution, said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity, is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount.
Since they have a lower interest rate, they wouldn't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility.
The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes, has at least a five-year maturity and doesn't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five.
The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore isn't deductible.
The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid. 

Currently, even though the issuer doesn't pay tax, the debt holder is taxed on the accrued interest.
But those holders are often foreign investors and tax-exempt pension funds that don't pay taxes on their holdings. 

The Senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $17 million the first year and a total of $409 million over five years.
The House version would raise slightly more. 

Even if Wall Street finds ways around the new rules, a Senate aide contends LBOs will become somewhat more difficult. "There's no question it will make LBOs more expensive," he said. "The interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive." 

Natural upheavals, and most particularly earthquakes, are not only horrible realities in and of themselves, but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed.
The rubble after the Armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed, quite literally, a city whose larger structures had been built with sand.
The extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference. 

The larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of San Francisco is surely with the state of the U.S. economy.
Did the stock-market tremors of Friday, Oct. 13, presage larger fragility, far greater upheavals?
Are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the spans of the Bay Bridge? 

The eerie complacency of the Reagan-Bush era has produced Panglossian paeans about the present perfection of U.S. economic and social arrangements.
A licensed government intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, recently announced in The National Interest that history is, so to speak, at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization.
His observations were taken seriously.
But we are, in reality, witnessing the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism: not so much the end of history but the history of the end. 

The financial equivalent of the sand used by those Armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them.
Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it's okay, necessary even, to look the other way.
And by the early 1980s U.S. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds, to look the other way. 

By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment.
Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate -- net pretax profits divided by capital stock -- peaked in 1965 at 17.2%.
That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6% in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1% in 1986 and 8% in 1987. 

Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in the early 1980s -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets, the famous Q ratio associated with Prof.
James Tobin.
In theory, the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same.
But of course the market could decide that the firm's capital stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits.
This is indeed what the market decided.
By 1982 the ratio was 43.5%, meaning that the market was valuing every dollar's worth of the average firm's assets at 43 cents. 

From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar's worth of a firm's capital stock, an alert entrepreneur won't look the other way.
His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits, thus restoring the market's faith in them.
Hence the LBO craze. 

But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet, and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way.
The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65% in 1987 and 68.9% in 1988.
Result: a landscape littered with lemons, huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America. 

The mounting risks did not go unobserved, even in the mid-1980s.
But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history (in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity) for society to continue shielding its eyes.
Mainstream economists and commentators, craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing, swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs, claimed the end result would be a leaner, meaner corporate America, with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall.
But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found.
The beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon was the topic figure of '80s capitalism, Michael Milken's $517 million salary in one year. 

Left-stream economists I associate with -- fellows in the Union of Radical Political Economists, most particularly Robert Pollin of the economics faculty at the University of California at Riverside -- were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant colleagues.
All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities.
Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher, and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow. 

The consequences of building empires with sand are showing up.
In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2% or 3%, a Harvard study published in April of this year (and discussed in a lead story in The Wall Street Journal for Sept. 18) found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34%. 

What is the consequence of a high-interest burden, high default rates and continued low profitability?
Corporations need liquidity, in the form of borrowed funds.
Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits, they look to the government, which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts.
The consequence can be inflation, brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash. 

Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort: an assault on wages.
Mr. Fukuyama, peering through binoculars at the end of history, said in his essay that "the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West . . . the egalitarianism of modern America represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by Marx." 

Mr. Fukuyama might want to consult some American workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism.
From its peak in 1972 of $198.41, the average American weekly wage had fallen to $169.28 in 1987 -- both figures being expressed in 1977 dollars.
In other words, after the glory boom of the Reagan years, wages had sunk from the post World War II peak by 16% as capitalists, helped by the government, turned down the screws or went offshore. 

But there are signs now -- the strikes by miners, Boeing workers, telephone workers, etc. -- that this attack on wages is being more fiercely resisted. 

These are long-term Richter readings on American capitalism.
The whole structure is extremely shaky.
Governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic (a word the London Times forbade my father to use when he was reporting the Wall Street crash in 1929).
But sophistication has its limits.
The S&L bailout could cost $300 billion, computing interest on the government's loans.
These are real costs.
Under what weights will the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation totter?
Capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks, but there are fault lines -- the crisis in profits, the assault on wages, the structural inequity of the system -- that make fools of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over. 

Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and LA Weekly. 

Congress sent President Bush an $18.4 billion fiscal 1990 Treasury and Postal Service bill providing $5.5 billion for the Internal Revenue Service and increasing the Customs Service's air-interdiction program nearly a third. 

Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the Senate, and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch. 

An estimated $33 million was added for university and science grants, including $1.5 million for Smith College.
And Southwest lawmakers were a driving force behind $54.6 million for U.S.-Mexico border facilities, or more than double the administration's request. 

More than $1.8 million is allocated for pensions and expenses for former presidents, and the budget for the official residence of Vice President Quayle is more than doubled, with $200,000 designated for improvements to the property.
Even the Office of Management and Budget is remembered with an extra $1 million to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked to absorb. 

Within the IRS, nearly $1.95 billion is provided for processing tax returns, a 12% increase over fiscal 1989 and double what the government was spending five years ago.
Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to $1.6 billion, and Congress specifically added $7.4 million for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic. 

The large increase in Customs Service air-interdiction funds is also intended to counter smuggling, and the annual appropriations level has more than quadrupled in five years.
The $196.7 million provided for fiscal 1990 anticipates the purchase of a Lockheed P-3 surveillance aircraft and five Cessna Citation II jets.
Despite administration reservations, the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from Cessna's home state, Kansas. 

Among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any Treasury Department expenditure for enforcement of a 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans.
Small-business interests have lobbied against the so-called Section 89 tax rules.
Repeal is considered likely now, but the Treasury Department bill has been used as a vehicle to raise the profile of the issue and block any action in the interim. 

Less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by Houston Republicans on behalf of HEI Corp. of Texas to retroactively "move" a Missouri hospital from one county to the next to justify higher Medicare reimbursements.
The provision seeks to wipe out an estimated $1.4 million in claims made by the Health Care Finance Administration against HEI, which owned the hospital in Sullivan, Mo., during most of the four-year period -- 1983-1987 -- covered in the amendment. 

In a separate development, a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.) and Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.) in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated $44 billion agriculture bill.
A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill, but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 

The program's nonprofit sponsors received $900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant, but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990.
The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox, entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use, but as a master of pork-barrel politics, he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border. 

Maurice Warren, 56-year-old group managing director, was named chief executive officer of this food and agriculture group.
The post of chief executive has been vacant since July when Terry Pryce, 55, left the company. 

Michael Maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs.
As thanks, the egg industry tried to break him. 

And the egg producers have done a pretty good job.
They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress.
Egg-industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban Mr. Maynard's automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over salmonella.
His company, Misa Manufacturing Inc., was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated.
Monthly sales of his Egg King machine -- which he now is marketing through a new company -- have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of 75, says the 46-year-old businessman. 

Mr. Maynard isn't the first entrepreneur to bump up against entrenched interests.
But his case is notable both for the scale of the fight -- it isn't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic -- and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product. 

Now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them.
Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry.
Many larger egg producers are also egg processors, who crack, inspect, and sanitize billions of eggs, turning them into powdered, liquified or frozen egg products. 

However, dozens of bakers, restaurant chefs and other food preparers who flocked to Mr. Maynard's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30-pound cans instead of shells.
But for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day, breaking them by hand can get, well, out of hand. 

The idea behind the Egg King is pretty simple: put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets, spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets. 

One Egg King -- which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been likened to the robot R2-D2 -- can crack about 20,000 eggs an hour.
Because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones, a big egg user can recover the Egg King's $3,390 cost in a few months, says Mr. Maynard. 

Such centrifugal egg breakers have been around since the 1890s.
But when Mr. Maynard came forward with his machine in the early 1970s nobody else was offering them in the U.S.
The main reason: salmonella. 

Chickens carry this bacteria, which can cause upset stomachs and, in rare cases, death among people.
Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs, and it can also be found on unclean shells.
Thus, any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones. 

Mr. Maynard claims this is a manageable problem.
The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and, as an added precaution, to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria.
With nearly 4,000 machines in use, there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed, Mr. Maynard boasts. 

He says the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an Egg King stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products.
But he says that's no more a reason for banning Egg Kings than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars. 

Opponents don't buy such arguments. "Human nature being what it is, people don't always follow instructions," says Jack Guzewich, chief of food protection for the New York state Health Department. 

Leading the assault against the Egg King has been United Egg Producers.
The Decatur, Ga., trade group has issued a "briefing book" that claims the machine is "a health hazard" and that Mr. Maynard is trying "to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation's egg producers." The UEP declines to comment, but the group's attorney, Alfred Frawley, says the group's actions are motivated solely by "health concerns." 

An early battleground was the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service.
Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard, another branch of the USDA, the Agricultural Marketing Service, was in charge of eggs.
After receiving complaints from egg producers, this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval, thus limiting the machine's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that aren't regulated by the USDA. 

The egg producers also lobbied the Food and Drug Administration.
But the FDA in a 1985 letter to the United Egg Producers said that there was "little likelihood" of a health problem as long as instructions were followed. 

So the producers went to Capitol Hill, where a congressman from Georgia introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg-breaking machines.
Mr. Maynard, whose company at the time was based in Santa Ana, Calif., enlisted his local congressman, and the battle was joined. 

Mr. Maynard's forces finally defeated the measure, though it took a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives to do it.
Even then, opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an "unscrupulous" method for breaking eggs. 

Foiled in their effort to get a national ban, the egg producers turned their attention to the states.
So far, New York, New Jersey, Nebraska, Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota have outlawed Mr. Maynard's device, citing health concerns. 

An antitrust suit that Mr. Maynard's company filed in Los Angeles federal court against the United Egg Producers and others only added to the entrepreneur's woes.
The judge dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. Maynard's company to pay over $100,000 in legal fees to the defendants' lawyers.
Mr. Maynard says the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court. 

Now he has moved to Oklahoma where costs are lower, and started a new company, Adsi Inc., to market his machine.
But, so far, the change of scenery hasn't ended his string of bad breaks.
Mr. Maynard recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm. 

The frenetic stock and bond markets cooled off, but the dollar slumped. 

Stocks rose slightly as trading activity slowed from the frenzied pace earlier this week.
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow band most of the day, finishing little changed despite the dollar's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon. 

Helped by futures-related program buying, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.92 points to close at 2643.65.
But the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell for the seventh-consecutive session as more investors dumped UAL shares. 

Bond prices rallied early yesterday morning as traders scrambled to buy Treasury issues on fears that the Northern California earthquake might lead to a stock-market debacle.
But when stocks held steady, Treasury bonds later retreated. 

Speculation that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in coming weeks helped push the dollar down while boosting stocks, traders said.
But many investors remain wary about stocks, partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers. 

"I'm surprised we didn't see more volatility" in stocks, said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. "I think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning, and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds.
In a bull market, credit does not matter," Mr. DeVoe added. "But when it does matter, then it's the only thing that matters." 

However, many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market's plunge as "a great buying opportunity," said Charles I. Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. "Things are beginning to settle down.
The markets are returning to normalcy." 

Oil prices initially rose on fears that the massive earthquake in Northern California would disrupt production.
But prices later reversed course, finishing slightly lower, as investors concluded that any cuts wouldn't be large and that foreign oil producers would quickly pick up the slack. 

In major market activity: 

Stock prices rose.
New York Stock Exchange volume shrank to 166.9 million shares from 224.1 million Tuesday.
Advancers on the Big Board outpaced decliners by 822 to 668. 

Bond prices were little changed in sluggish activity.
The yield on the Treasury's 30-year issue fell slightly to 8.03%. 

The dollar dropped.
In New York late yesterday, the currency was at 141.45 yen and 1.8485 marks, down from 142.75 yen and 1.8667 marks late Tuesday. 

The government said 13.1% of Americans, or 31.9 million people, were living in poverty in 1988. 

While last year's figure was down from 13.4% in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate, the Census Bureau said the 1988 drop wasn't statistically significant. 

The bureau's report also showed that while some measures of the nation's economic well-being improved modestly in 1988, the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before. 

Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households, William Butz, associate director of the Census Bureau, said that "most groups either stayed the same or improved." But, he added, "Since the late 1960s, the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal.
There was no reversal {of that trend} between 1987 and 1988." 

Per capita income, a widely used measure of a nation's economic health, hit a record in 1988, rising 1.7% after inflation adjustment to $13,120.
But the median income of American families fell 0.2%, the first time it has failed to rise since 1982. 

Mr. Butz said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure, including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by Americans who aren't living in families. 

As a result of last year's decline, the government's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000.
The poverty threshold, defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the Agricultural Department, last year was $12,092 for a family of four.
The Census Bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line, but it doesn't consider other government benefits, such as Medicare. 

Thanks largely to the continued growth of the U.S. economy, the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3%, but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years. 

Poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other Americans.
In 1988, 31.6% of blacks lived in poverty, compared with 10.1% for whites and 26.8% for Hispanics.
But two-thirds of all poor Americans were white.
More than half of poor families were headed by women living without men, the bureau said.
More than three-fourths of poor black families were headed by women. 

The poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7% from 20.5% in 1987, but remained far higher than a decade ago.
The rate among the elderly -- 12% in 1988 -- wasn't significantly lower than the year before.
If it weren't for Social Security payments, more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line, Mr. Butz said. 

The Census Bureau also said: 

-- Some 17.2% of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5% of all families, up from 16.9% in 1987.
That is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950, although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison. 

-- The top fifth of all families got 44% of the income, up from 41.5% a decade earlier.
The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6% of the income, down from 5.2% a decade earlier. 

-- Confirming other government data showing that wages aren't keeping pace with inflation, earnings of year-round, full-time male workers fell 1.3% in 1988 after adjusting for higher prices, the first such drop since 1982.
Earnings of female workers were unchanged. 

-- Women working full-time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned by men, a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978. 

-- Median household income -- which includes both those living in families and those who aren't -- rose 0.3% last year to $27,225 after inflation.
It rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest and fell slightly in the South and West.
Median family income was $32,191, down 0.2%. 

-- Per capita income of blacks, though still only 60% that of whites, rose 3.9% in 1988, while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5%. 

-- Among married couples, the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply, as income of black families shot up 6.8% while income of whites didn't budge. 

Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years, the Census Bureau also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983.
The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 -- and the poverty rate would have been 10.5% instead of 13.1% -- under the alternative calculation. 

Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years.
A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded, "It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes." 

The official poverty threshold is set by the Office of Management and Budget. 

Enron Corp. said a subsidiary and two United Kingdom firms are studying the feasibility of constructing a 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant in northern England as an outgrowth of the government's privatization program. 

Enron Power Corp., a unit of the Houston natural gas pipeline company, would design, construct and run the plant.
Gas to fuel it would be piped from the North Sea. 

A subsidiary of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries would buy electricity and steam from the proposed station.
Surplus power would be sold on the open market, Enron said.
Also participating in the study, Enron said, is the National Power division of Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board. 

Upon privatization, National Power will be responsible for 70% of the country's power generating business. 

whose Della Femina McNamee WCRS agency created liar Joe Isuzu, among others -- announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to Paris-based Eurocom. 

The complex restructuring, which was long expected, transforms London-based WCRS from primarily a creator of advertising into one of Europe's largest buyers of advertising time and space.
It also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by Eurocom and headed jointly by New York ad man Jerry Della Femina and two top WCRS executives.
The merged agency's admittedly ambitious goal: to become one of the world's 10 largest agencies, while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone. 

WCRS's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in Europe, where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk.
For Eurocom, meanwhile, the move gives it a strong U.S. foothold in Della Femina, and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world-wide.
It also gives the outspoken Mr. Della Femina -- who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients -- an international platform that he most certainly won't be loath to use. 

According to terms, WCRS will pay 2.02 billion French francs ($318.6 million) for the 50% it doesn't already own of Carat Holding S.A., one of Europe's largest media buyers.
Meanwhile, Eurocom, which had held 20% of WCRS's ad unit, will pay #43.5 million ($68.5 million) to raise its stake to 60%.
That price also covers Eurocom raising to 60% its 51% stake in Europe's Belier Group, a joint venture ad agency network it owns with WCRS. Eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining 40% of the merged ad agency group in six years. 

The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd., or EWDB.
The merged agency will include Della Femina McNamee based in New York, Eurocom's various agencies in France, the Belier Group in Europe and WCRS's other advertising and direct marketing operations. 

Mr. Della Femina will be joint chairman with former WCRS executive Robin Wight.
Both will report to Tim Breene, a former WCRS executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency. 

In an interview in New York, Mr. Breene, fresh from a Concorde flight from Paris where executives had worked through most of the night, outlined big plans for the new agency. "Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-10 position . . . by the end of three years from now.
It implies very dramatic growth," he said.
He added that Eurocom and WCRS had agreed to provide a development fund of #100 million for acquisitions.
The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in Spain, while Mr. Breene said it also plans to make acquisitions in Scandinavia, Germany and elsewhere. 

Cracking the top 10 within three years will be difficult at best.
Della Femina had billings of just $660 million last year and ranked as the U.S.'s 24th-largest ad agency.
The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $2.6 billion -- most of that in Europe -- bringing it to about 14th world-wide.
To make it to top-10 status, it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as Grey Advertising, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Omnicom's DDB Needham. 

The merged agency's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods advertisers may prove equally difficult.
When WCRS created Della Femina McNamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988, it said it did so in order to attract larger clients, especially packaged-goods companies.
Since then, Della Femina won Pan Am as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients, including Dow Chemical Co. 's Saran Wrap. 

But major packaged-goods players of the world -- such as Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever -- have steadfastly eluded the agency. "Three of our favorite names," Mr. Della Femina calls that roster, adding hopefully, "We're a much more attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday." 

Still, the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying firms that Europe has seen.
As part of the restructuring, WCRS and Eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across Europe. 

What's more, both Eurocom and brothers Francis and Gilbert Gross, who founded Carat, will acquire 14.99% stakes in WCRS Group, creating a powerful link between Eurocom and Carat.
Carat will receive its WCRS stake as part of payment for the 50% Carat stake that WCRS is buying, while Eurocom said it expects to pay about #32 million for its WCRS stake. 

Mr. Della Femina says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency, serving as a sort of "creative conscience." Louise McNamee, Della Femina's president, will continue running the U.S. agency day-to-day.
They and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and Mr. Della Femina will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum, which some industry executives pegged at about $10 million. 

WCRS Group, for its part, will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming "a holding company for a series of media-related businesses," said Peter Scott, the firm's chief executive.
In addition to Carat, WCRS will hold onto its public relations, TV programming and other businesses.
WCRS says its debt will be cut to #24 million from #66 million as a result of the transaction. 

For Carat, meanwhile, the alliance with Eurocom and WCRS is intended to strengthen its own push outside France.
Carat's Gross brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space.
By buying the space in bulk, they obtain discounts as high as 50%, which they can pass on to customers.
They thus have won the French space-buying business of such advertising giants as Coca-Cola Co., Fiat S.p.
A., Gillette and Kodak.
But now, other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying groups -- and Carat wants to expand to the rest of Europe. 

To help finance the Carat purchase, WCRS said it plans an issue of Euroconvertible preferred shares once the market settles down.
But WCRS added that "in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets," it has arranged medium-term debt financing, which would be underwritten by Samuel Montagu & Co. Ltd. 

Earthquake's Damage 

Tuesday's earthquake brought the San Francisco ad scene to a screeching halt yesterday, with only a few staffers showing up at their offices, mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new-business presentations. 

While no agencies reported injuries to employees, the quake damaged the offices of J. Walter Thompson, Chiat/Day/Mojo and DDB Needham, among others, spokesmen for those agencies said.
Staffers at Thompson, whose offices are in the ultramodern Embarcadero Center, watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet, according to a spokeswoman.
Plaster fell and windows were broken at Chiat/Day/Mojo, a spokesman for that agency said. 

Late yesterday afternoon, DDB Needham executives were scrambling to figure out what to do about a new business presentation that had been scheduled for today, a spokesman said.
DDB Needham's office building may have sustained structural damage, the spokesman added. "All operations have stopped," he said.
A number of agencies, including Thompson and Foote, Cone & Belding, said some employees who live outside of San Francisco, fearful that they wouldn't be able to get home, spent the night at the agency.

Diamond-Star Motors Corp., a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said it will begin shipping Mitsubishi Eclipse cars to Japan next week, emulating other Japanese auto ventures shipping U.S.-built vehicles back to Japan. 

Diamond-Star said it will export about 1,500 Eclipse cars to Japan by year's end.

A grand jury here indicted Norton Co. 's former director of advanced-ceramics research, charging him with interstate transportation of stolen property. 

Norton and General Electric Co. last month filed a lawsuit against the former research manager, Chien-Min Sung, charging him with stealing trade secrets. 

Mr. Sung formerly worked at General Electric in research on synthetic diamonds.
The criminal charges brought against him involved GE technology, according the court documents.
If convicted, he could be imprisoned for up to 10 years and fined $250,000. 

Mr. Sung couldn't be reached for comment.
He earlier denied the allegations against him in the lawsuit by Norton and GE. 

Norton makes sandpaper and other abrasives, diamond tools, specialty plastics and ceramics. 

Trinova Corp., Maumee, Ohio, said it is launching an extensive restructuring of its core business, and took a charge that resulted in a loss of $29.7 million, or 87 cents a share, for the third quarter. 

Trinova said it will close, move or overhaul 40 of its 170 manufacturing facilities and over the next three years cut 1,500 jobs from its current world-wide payroll of 22,300 employees.
Most of the factory closings and job cutbacks will affect Trinova's Aeroquip operations, which manufacture automotive plastics, hoses and other industrial and automotive parts.
Hoses and plastics together account for about 42% of Trinova's total annual sales. 

In a separate announcement, Trinova said the Aeroquip group has agreed to sell its spring-brake, piston-brake and related businesses to Midland Brake Inc. of Branford, Conn.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

To provide for the restructuring's costs, Trinova said it took an after-tax charge of $38.5 million, or $1.13 a share, in the third quarter.
The $29.7 million net loss compares with net income of $19.6 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 8% to $456.2 million from $422 million. 

Trinova closed at $25, down $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D., Ohio) at last week's hearings on irregularities in programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development: 

I don't want to feel guilty representing my constituents.
And if I think that some people {on HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's} staff are off base in terms in which they're evaluating certain things affecting my hometown, I have to tell you something -- I'm not going to take it.
I think that I'm elected to represent the people that sent me here.
And one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our area.
And if we're not ombudsman for our area, we ought to be thrown out of office.
On the other hand, if we're asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on, then that's a whole different story.
But if I feel that there are situations where I'm trying to get housing for our area -- whatever it happens to be -- and I have to feel that I can't even ask a question, I've got to tell you, I think that's outrageous. . 

I think these regulations that would prohibit well-operated programs in areas across this country would be wrong to change. . . . I don't want to see some guidelines change that's going to inhibit my city's opportunity to use its money.

Senate Republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations. 

At the same time, a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon. 

Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal, said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along, particularly this month's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit. 

He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year, though it probably won't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill.
He added that he expects to talk to the Democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal. 

For individuals, the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year.
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35%.
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1, 1989.
As an alternative, he said, taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index. 

For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29% for corporate assets held for 15 years. 

The Packwood plan would also include a proposal, designed by Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts.
The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses.
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax. 

For their part, the group of Democrats are working on a plan that, like the Packwood proposal, would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies.
Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held.
An extra exclusion would be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size corporations just starting up. 

No one in the Senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the House.
That plan would provide a 30% exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1/2-year period ending Dec. 31, 1991.
After then, the House measure would boost the tax rate to 28% and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation.
Senators are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent. 

Separately, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee said he didn't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit.
The current debt limit expires Oct. 31. 

He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit, including the House-passed capital-gains provision. 

Viacom Inc., New York, reported that its third-quarter loss widened to $21.7 million, or 41 cents a share, primarily because of interest expense of $70.1 million. 

A year ago, Viacom had a net loss of $56.9 million, or $1.07 a share.
Interest expense in the 1988 third quarter was $75.3 million.
In the year-ago quarter, Viacom also paid preferred stock dividends of $17 million; Viacom exchanged its preferred stock for debt in March. 

The communications and entertainment company said revenue rose to $345.5 million, from $311.6 million. 

Viacom attributed the improvement to higher earnings from operations in its networks segment, which includes the MTV and Showtime networks. 

Viacom said it also restructured bank debt under a $1.5 billion unsecured bank agreement that offers significant interest rate savings.
Sumner M. Redstone, Viacom's chairman, said Viacom "emerged from our leveraged buy-out structure and gained substantial operating and financial flexibility through" the bank pact. 

Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said it suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and reported a 91% plunge in third-quarter net income. 

The announcement, made after the close of trading, caught analysts by surprise.
The company closed at $12 a share, down 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Pinnacle West slashed its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from 70 cents in December, saying at the time that it believed the new, lower dividend was "sustainable." 

A company spokesman said the decision to eliminate the dividend resulted from a quarterly appraisal and that circumstances had changed since the December announcement.
He declined to elaborate. 

Edward J. Tirello Jr., an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., speculated that the sudden dividend elimination presages an expensive agreement with thrift regulators over the company's insolvent MeraBank savings and loan unit. 

Analysts have estimated that Pinnacle West may have to inject between $300 million and $400 million into the MeraBank unit before turning the thrift over to federal regulators. 

The latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company, based in Phoenix, Ariz., reflect continuing problems at MeraBank and losses in real-estate, venture-capital and uranium-mining operations. 

Third-quarter net income slid to $5.1 million, or six cents a share, from $56 million, or 65 cents, a year earlier. 

Utility operations, the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period, had a 26% drop in profit, to $86.3 million, largely as a result of outages at the company's huge Palo Verde nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power. 

In other operations, losses at MeraBank totaled $85.7 million in the latest quarter, compared with a $2.5 million profit a year earlier.
The latest quarter includes a $42.7 million addition to loan-loss reserves.
As recently as August, the company said it didn't foresee a need for substantial additions to reserves. 

Pinnacle's SunCor Development Co. real-estate unit's loss narrowed to $13.8 million from $78.4 million.
The latest period included a $9 million write-down on undeveloped land, while the year-earlier period included a $46 million reserve for real-estate losses. 

Losses at its Malapai Resources Co. uranium-mining unit narrowed to $3.4 million from $18 million a year ago, which included a $9 million write-down of utility inventories. 

Losses at El Dorado Investment Co., the venture-capital operation, widened to $6.8 million from $425,000 a year earlier.
The latest quarter included a $6.6 million write-down of investments.

But on the evidence of "The Fabulous Baker Boys," that may be the only thing she can't do, at least when she's acting in movies. 

As the tough, slinky lounge chanteuse in "The Fabulous Baker Boys," Ms. Pfeiffer sings for herself, and more than passably well.
Her Susie Diamond handles a song the way the greats do, like she's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she's concentrating on matching that internal tone.
Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music.
When she isn't performing for an audience, she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth, and indicates that she's finished by sticking the gum back in. 

Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie, Ms. Pfeiffer's Susie seems like someone you've seen before, in numerous show-biz stories (even her name, Susie Diamond, sounds like a character Marilyn Monroe must have played).
Yet nothing about "Baker Boys," and certainly nothing about Ms. Pfeiffer, really is like something from the video vault. 

Steve Kloves, the young writer and director (he isn't yet 30), has only one produced picture to his credit; he wrote the screenplay for "Racing With the Moon," a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s.
Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older, someone who doesn't dismiss dreams, but who also has enough experience to see his limits.
However, Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace; "Baker Boys" is both bluesy and funny. 

He's put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched; for example, the way Susie wows an audience the first time she sings with the Baker Boys.
Of course, it doesn't hurt that Mr. Kloves has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they're doing. 

Much of the picture's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's slyly seductive lens work.
After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder, the late German director, and more recently with Martin Scorsese ("After Hours," "The Color of Money," "The Last Temptation of Christ"), Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style.
And Dave Grusin's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship ("Feelings" is a must) without condescension. 

Though Ms. Pfeiffer has the flashy part -- she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heelsthe boys are pretty great, too.
What seemed like a good idea, to cast the Bridges brothers (Jeff and Beau) as the Baker brothers, actually turned out to be a good idea.
Anyone who's tried to appear "natural" in front of a camera knows that it's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff.
So it's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers isn't natural at all, that Jeff and Beau had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love -- and resentment and frustration and rage -- seem so very real. 

When the movie opens the Baker brothers are doing what they've done for 15 years professionally, and twice as long as that for themselves: They're playing proficient piano, face-to-face, on twin pianos.
They're small time in the small time-hotels (not the best ones) and restaurants in Seattle.
Yet they don't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act.
They wear tuxedos most nights, unless circumstances (a regular gig at a "tropical" lounge, for example) require them to wear special costumes, like Hawaiian shirts. 

Plump Beau, looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face, plays the older brother, Frank.
Frank plans the program, takes care of business, and approaches the work like any other job.
He's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job.
He's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs; the audience sees only the house, and only near the end of the movie.
Frank grovels a little for the bookers, probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation.
On his off-hours he wears cardigan sweaters. 

Jeff Bridges is the younger brother, Jack, who fancies himself the rebellious artist; he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs, who climbs down the fire escape.
Yet Jack's the one who can remember every dive they ever played, and when, and he dutifully shows up for work night after night (he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute).
Looking leaner than he has in a while, the younger Mr. Bridges's Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than Frank, who's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated.
He can live with little pleasures. 

Mr. Kloves has put together some priceless moments.
These include Jennifer Tilly's audition to be the Baker Boys' girl singer.
Ms. Tilly of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster's girlfriend on the television show, "Hill Street Blues." Here she delivers, especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the "Candy Man," which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that couldn't be more perfect. (It matches her voice.) And Ms. Pfeiffer's particular version of "Making Whoopee" -- and the way Mr. Ballhaus photographs her, from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress -- might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer hadn't gone and become a star in her own right. 

VIDEO TIP: If you'd like to see the first time Michelle Pfeiffer sang on screen, and you have a lot of patience, take a look at "Grease 2." You'll find her there.
Better yet, check out the emergence of her comic persona in "Married to the Mob," Jonathan Demme's delightful Mafia comedy.

Money-market mutual fund assets grew at nearly three times their usual rate in the latest week, as investors opted for safety instead of the stock market. 

Money-fund assets soared $4.5 billion in the week ended Tuesday, to a record $348.4 billion, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. 

"We were expecting it, following the fall of the Dow Friday," said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report. "It's the proverbial flight to safety." 

Despite recent declines in interest rates, money funds continue to offer better yields than other comparable investments.
The average seven-day compound yield on the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's was 8.55% in the latest week, down from 8.60%.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for a year. 

Most short-term certificates of deposit are yielding about 8% or less at major banks, and the yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction fell to 7.61% for three months and 7.82% for six months. 

Money-fund assets have been rising at an average rate of $1.6 billion a week in recent months, Ms. Negus said, reflecting the relatively high yields.
In the latest week, funds open to institutions alone grew by $1.8 billion. 

Some fund managers say inflows could increase in coming days as a result of stock selling in the wake of Friday's 190.58point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. "If you're selling equities, you don't start getting proceeds for five to seven days," said Frank Rachwalski, who manages the Kemper Money Market Fund. 

Neal Litvack, marketing vice president for Fidelity Investments, said inflows Friday into Fidelity's Spartan and Cash Reserves money-market funds were about twice normal levels, with about half coming from equity and junk-bond funds.
Monday and Tuesday "were lackluster in comparison," he said. 

"People aren't necessarily running scared," Mr. Litvack said. "They're maintaining their attitude toward investing, which has leaned toward the conservative recently." 

Money-fund yields tend to lag interestrate trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments -- short-term Treasury securities, commercial paper and the like -- to capture the highest yields.
Maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling. 

The average maturity of the funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's remained at 38 days for the third consecutive week.
It was as short as 29 days at the start of this year, when rates were marching steadily upward, and hit 42 days in August. 

The average seven-day simple yield of the funds fell to 8.21% this week from 8.26%.
The average 30-day simple yield was 8.26%, compared with 8.27% the week before, and the 30-day compound yield slid to 8.60% from 8.61%. 

Some funds are posting yields far higher than the average.
The highest yielding taxable fund this week was Harbor Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 12.75%.
That included capital gains that were passed along to customers. 

Among the other high-yielding funds, Fidelity's Spartan Fund had a seven-day compound yield of 9.33% in the latest week.
The seven-day compound yield of the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Fund was 9.51%. 

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it fined Capcom Futures Inc. $500,000 and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm. 

Capcom Futures is a Chicago subsidiary of Capcom Financial Services Ltd., a London financial firm that was implicated last year in a scheme to launder drug money.
The case is pending.
The firm was indicted in Tampa, Fla., on money-laundering charges. 

In June, the Chicago Board of Trade said it suspended Capcom Financial.
The Capcom Futures unit withdrew from Board of Trade membership voluntarily in August, a Board of Trade spokesman said. 

Capcom Futures, while neither admitting nor denying the Merc charges, said in a statement that the Merc charges were "technical in nature" and that "no customers were hurt" as a result of the violations cited by the Merc. 

The Merc alleged that, among other things, from April 1987 through October 1988 Capcom Futures failed to document trades between Capcom Futures and people or entities directly or indirectly controlled by Capcom Futures shareholders. 

Digital Equipment Corp. is planning a big coming-out party on Tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers.
But an uninvited guest is expected to try to crash the party. 

On the morning of the long-planned announcement, International Business Machines Corp. is to introduce its own new mainframe. "Their attitude is, `You want to talk mainframes, we'll talk mainframes, '" says one computer industry executive. 

"They're deliberately trying to steal our thunder," a Digital executive complains. "Maybe we should take it as a compliment." 

Digital's target is the $40 billion market for mainframe computers, the closet-sized number-crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business.
IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., has dominated the market for decades. 

That doesn't scare Digital, which has grown to be the world's second-largest computer maker by poaching customers of IBM's mid-range machines.
Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes, and it has spent almost $1 billion developing the new technology.
A spoiler, nimble Tandem Computers Inc. in Cupertino, Calif., jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry. 

IBM appears more worried about Digital, which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line, dubbed the VAX 9000. "It's going to be nuclear war," says Thomas Willmott, a consultant with Aberdeen Group Inc. 

The surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market, where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years.
IBM's traditional mainframe rivals, including Unisys Corp., Control Data Corp. and NCR Corp., have struggled recently. 

Digital is promising a new approach.
Robert M. Glorioso, Digital's vice president for high performance systems, says Digital's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves, but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations, personal computers, printers and other devices.
And unlike IBM's water-cooled mainframes, it doesn't need any plumbing. 

The challengers will have a big price advantage.
Digital is expected to tag its new line from about $1.24 million to $4.4 million and up, depending on configuration.
That's about half the price of comparably equipped IBM mainframes.
Tandem's pricing is just as aggressive. 

The heightened competition will hit IBM at a difficult time.
The computer giant's current mainframe line, which has sold well and has huge profit margins, is starting to show its age.
The new 3090s due next week will boost performance by only about 8% to 10%.
And IBM isn't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991. 

Still, no one expects IBM's rivals to deliver a knockout.
IBM has a near-monopoly on mainframes, with an estimated 70% share of the market.
IBM is five times the size of Digital -- and 40 times the size of Tandem -- and wields enormous market power.
It counts among its customers a majority of the world's largest corporations, which entrust their most critical business information to IBM computers. 

"We're not going to walk in and replace a company's corporate accounting system if it's already running on an IBM mainframe," concedes Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's president. 

He says Digital will target faster-growing market segments such as on-line transaction processing, which includes retail-sales tracking, airline reservations and bank-teller networks.
Tandem, which already specializes in on-line transaction processing, is a potent competitor in that market. 

A key marketing target for Digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both Digital and IBM systems.
One such company is Bankers Trust Co. Stanley Rose, a vice president, technological and strategic planning at Bankers Trust, says that despite Digital's low prices, "we aren't about to unplug our IBM mainframes for a DEC machine.
The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings." 

But Mr. Rose is still looking seriously at the 9000.
Bankers Trust uses Digital's VAX to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts, juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day, he says.
As that system grows, larger computers may be needed. "In the past, customers had to go to IBM when they outgrew the VAX. Now they don't have to," he says. "That's going to cost IBM revenue." 

Analysts say Digital can expect this pent-up demand for the new VAX to fuel strong sales next year.
Barry F. Willman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., estimates the 9000 could boost sales by more than $1 billion in the fiscal year beginning in July.
He bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of Digital's largest customers. 

Although Digital will announce a full family of mainframes next week, it isn't expected to begin shipping in volume until next year.
The first model available will be the 210, which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger, or vector processor, says Terry Shannon of International Data Corp., a market research concern. 

Four more models, aimed squarely at IBM's commercial customers, are expected to begin shipping in late June.
Most analysts don't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter, which begins next July 1. 

Digital's new line has been a long time coming.
The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product, and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end.
Digital's failure to deliver a true mainframe-class machine before now may have cost the company as much as $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1989, Mr. Willman says. 

IBM will face still more competition in coming months.
Amdahl Corp., backed by Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., has a growing share of the market with its low-priced, IBM-compatible machines.
And National Advanced Systems, a joint venture of Japan's Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors Corp. 's Electronic Data Systems, is expected to unveil a line of powerful IBM-compatible mainframes later this year.

This temblor-prone city dispatched inspectors, firefighters and other earthquake-trained personnel to aid San Francisco.
But a secondary agenda among officials in the City of Angels was to learn about the disaster-contingency plans that work and those that don't. 

Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley used the opportunity to push the City Council harder to pass a measure establishing a loss-recovery reserve of $100 million.
The amount would help Los Angeles cope in the first few weeks after its own anticipated quake, while waiting for federal assistance to arrive. 

After San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos spoke on television of the need for building inspectors to check the soundness of buildings, Los Angeles dispatched 32 inspectors to help.
And the county of Los Angeles placed its firefighters and sheriffs on alert, ready to send in reinforcements, and alerted San Francisco that the city has 1,000 hospital beds at its disposal. 

Two Los Angeles radio stations initiated Red Cross donation campaigns, and one Los Angeles bank manager forked over $150,000 of his own money for relief purposes, the Red Cross said. 

The Los Angeles Red Cross sent 2,480 cots, 500 blankets, and 300 pints of Type-O blood.
It is also pulling 20 people out of Puerto Rico, who were helping Huricane Hugo victims, and sending them to San Francisco instead. 

Lotus Development Corp. reported a surprisingly strong 51% increase in third-quarter net income on a 32% sales gain, buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its 1-2-3 computer spreadsheet. 

The results topped analysts' expectations and the earnings growth of competitors, prompting traders to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the company for much of the past two years. 

Yesterday, in heavy, national over-the-counter trading, Lotus shares rose to $32.50, up $1.25 apiece, capping a threemonth run-up of more than 40%. 

Lotus said net rose to $23 million, or 54 cents a share, on sales of $153.9 million.
A year ago, net was $14.3 million, or 31 cents a share, on sales of $116.8 million. 

For the nine months, net of $38.5 million, or 92 cents a share, trailed the year earlier's $49.9 million, or $1.08 a share.
Sales rose to $406 million from $356 million the year earlier.
In the first half, Lotus struggled to keep market share with costly promotions while customers awaited the launch of 1-2-3 Release 3, the upgraded spreadsheet software. 

Lotus's results were about 10% higher than analysts' average expectations and compared favorably with the 36% earnings rise reported a day earlier by rival Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash.
The company said results were bolstered by upgrades to Release 3 by previous customers and improved profit margins, the result of manufacturing-cost controls. 

Rick Sherlund, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said Lotus had upgrade revenue of about $22 million in the quarter, twice what he had expected.
Also, he estimated unit shipments of 1-2-3 in all its forms were about 315,000, up 7% from 1988's quarterly average. 

Demand for the new version was enabling Lotus to raise prices with distributors and to hold market share against Microsoft and other competitors that tried to exploit the earlier delays in Release 3's launch, Mr. Sherlund added.
He estimated that 1-2-3 outsold Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet by four-to-one in the quarter, and held a 70% or better share of the spreadsheet market. 

Jaguar PLC's chairman said he hopes to reach a friendly pact with General Motors Corp. within a month that may involve the British luxury-car maker's producing a cheaper executive model. 

Sir John Egan told reporters at London's Motorfair yesterday he "would be disappointed if we couldn't do {the deal} within a month." He said the tie-up would mean Jaguar could "develop cars down range {in price} from where we are" by offering access to GM's high-volume parts production.
Besides creating joint manufacturing ventures, the accord is expected to give GM about a 15% stake that eventually would rise to about 30%. 

Jaguar figures a friendly alliance with GM will fend off unwelcome advances from Ford Motor Co.
But Ford, Jaguar's biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to 10.4% this week, is pressing harder for talks with Sir John. "We're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet" with him, one Ford official said yesterday.
Ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon, he added. 

Sir John has spurned Ford's advances since the U.S. auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as 15% of Jaguar last month.
Ford has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later. "I'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody," the Jaguar chairman asserted yesterday.
He didn't rule out negotiations with Ford, however.
The fiercely proud but financially strapped British company prefers to remain independent and publicly held, despite Ford's promise of access to cash and technological know-how. 

Sir John noted that GM, a longtime Jaguar supplier, agrees "we should remain an independent company." He said Jaguar started negotiating with GM and several other car makers over a year ago, but the rest "dropped by the wayside ever since the share price went above #4 ($6.30) a share." Jaguar shares stood at 405 pence before Ford's initial announcement, but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up.
The stock traded late yesterday on London's stock exchange at 673 pence, up 19 pence. 

Developing an executive-model range would mark a major departure for Britain's leading luxury-car maker.
A typical British executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car.
It generally fetches no more than #25,000 ($39,400) -- roughly #16,000 less than the highest-priced Jaguars, which are all known for their hand-crafted leather work. 

"We have designs for such {executive} cars, but have never been able to develop them," Sir John said.
GM's help would "make it possible {for Jaguar} to build a wider range of cars." An executive model would significantly boost Jaguar's yearly output of 50,000 cars. "You are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year," said Bob Barber, an auto-industry analyst at U.K. brokerage James Capel & Co. 

A pact with GM may emerge in as little as two weeks, according to sources close to the talks.
The deal would require approval by a majority of Jaguar shareholders. "We have to make it attractive enough that {holders} would accept it," Sir John said. 

That may be difficult, the Jaguar chairman acknowledged, "when you have somebody else breathing down your neck." Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later, said Stephen Reitman, European auto analyst at London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew. 

Ford can't make a full-fledged bid for Jaguar until U.K. government restrictions expire.
The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15% of Jaguar shares without permission until Dec. 31, 1990. 

But with its 10.4% stake, Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely. "It's a very valuable weapon in their armory," which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar, observed Mr. Barber of James Capel. 

Otherwise, Jaguar may have to tolerate the two U.S. auto giants each owning a 15% stake for more than a year. "It would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective," Sir John said. "It has never been done before, but there's always a first." 

From a helicopter a thousand feet above Oakland after the second-deadliest earthquake in U.S. history, a scene of devastation emerges: a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich, hoses pumping water into once-fashionable apartments, abandoned autos. 

But this quake wasn't the big one, the replay of 1906 that has been feared for so many years.
Despite the tragic loss of more than 270 lives, and damage estimated in the billions, most businesses and their plants and offices in the Bay area weren't greatly affected. 

The economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two, although some transportation problems may last weeks or months.
A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland.
Also, the region's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage. 

The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance, so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows, falling brick and cornices, buckled asphalt or sidewalks. 

Of course, the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation's capital of high technology.
Like other major American cities, the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world's great natural harbors. 

When the tremors struck, the region's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air.
Michael L. Bandler, vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co., says nearly all the network's computer switches, which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another, changed to battery power when the city lost power.
The battery packs have enough power for only three hours, but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel.
Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell's network, only four went down.
One of those was in Hollister, Calif., near the earthquake's epicenter. 

Few telephone lines snapped.
That's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points.
The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake. 

Nevertheless, phone service was sporadic; many computer terminals remained dark, and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power.
Business in the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed; an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home. 

The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself, as virtually all businesses shut down.
The $125-billion-a-year Bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation's most populous state and accounts for 2% to 3% of the nation's total output of goods and services, according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.
In high-tech, the Bay area accounts for 15% to 20% of the U.S. computer-related industry. 

"This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy," says Pauline Sweezey, the chief economist at the California Department of Finance. "Obviously, things are going to have to go on hold for many companies." 

The damage to the Bay area's roadways could cause significant economic hardship.
A quarter of a million people cross the Bay Bridge every day, far more than the 100,000 that use the Bay Area Rapid Transit system (BART) -- which was working but wasn't stopping in the city's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks. 

California state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless don't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the Bay area.
All major roadways except Interstate 880, known as the Nimitz Freeway, and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday. 

Officials expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown San Francisco.
The earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack, making them impassible.
Other roads were obstructed by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines, an emergency relief spokesman says.
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated the damage to his city alone at $2 billion. 

But many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short-lived.
Of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper, few reported any damage that they didn't expect to have remedied within a day or two.
It is possible, of course, that some of the most seriously damaged companies couldn't be reached, particularly in areas nearest the epicenter. 

Typical, perhaps, was the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the General Motors Corp.-Toyota joint-venture auto plant in Fremont, about 35 miles south of Oakland.
Ten of the plant's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift; seven were hospitalized.
Metal racks on the plant floor fell over, and water mains ruptured, a spokeswoman says.
The plant was evacuated and workers sent home. 

But the plant was able to resume limited production of its Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms by 6 a.m. yesterday, and absenteeism was only 7% of the work force, about twice normal. 

Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co., based in Palo Alto, says one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation.
Other buildings had broken glass, dangling light fixtures and broken pipes, a spokesperson says, estimating the cost of reconstruction "in the millions." 

Most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated.
At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Vice President Robert Fienberg says operations were "steaming along as usual" yesterday afternoon. 

`When the quake hit, we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up," he says.
The Fed serves as a middleman for banks, taking checks from one bank and sending them to another, an operation that it handled smoothly Tuesday night after the quake. "The volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual," he says.
A disaster-contingency plan in which the Los Angeles Fed would come to San Francisco's aid wasn't needed, he adds. 

Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion.
The telephone network simply couldn't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time.
The volume resulted in dial-tone delays that were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five minutes.
Mr. Bandler puts traffic volume at 10 to 50 times normal. 

American Telephone & Telegraph Co., MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area to alleviate congestion.
The companies block traffic much as highway on-ramps are blocked when traffic backs up.
William E. Downing, Pacific Bell's vice president of customer services for the Bay area, says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50% of all calls.
Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50% of its calls locally. 

Ironically, the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area's economic fortunes and, indeed, the nation's gross national product.
It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck highways. 

"It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help," says Beth Burnham Mace, a regional economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. 

The construction industry is sure to feel increased demand. "There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state, federal and local employment," Ms. Mace says.
Adds Stacy Kotman, an economist at Georgia State University, "There's nothing positive about an earthquake, but it will probably generate more construction activity." 

Wall Street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies.
Shares of Lone Star Industries Inc., a cement maker, rose sharply in anticipation of stepped-up demand.
In Greenwich, Conn., Lone Star spokesman Michael London says, "Obviously with an earthquake of this size, there are likely to be construction projects that wouldn't otherwise have been anticipated.
But any increase isn't likely to be any kind of a surge.
It's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time.
There will be a lot of repair work that won't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would." Lone Star's San Francisco facilities weren't damaged in the quake. 

The earthquake is likely to reduce GNP negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins.
The first effects are, of course, negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending.
Corporate profits may also dip initially.
Many of the lost tourism dollars won't be recovered; many trips delayed never take place. 

Subsequently, however, the ill effects are likely to be offset, at least in economic terms, as construction activity begins.
Because of the way the government keeps its books, the damage to the Bay Bridge, however costly, won't be counted as a minus.
The money spent on repairs will be counted as a plus. 

"It's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this," says Andrew Goldberg, who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington, D.C. "You certainly can say it's going to be extremely severe.
We really are talking about shutting down a major American city for a number of days, maybe for a few weeks." 

Mr. Goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $1 billion and could reach $4 billion.
He cautions that early damage estimates are often low; the damage totals in Hurricane Hugo increased tenfold as more information was received.
The earthquake damage, of course, would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown San Francisco.
A direct hit on a major city, Mr. Goldberg figures, would cause $20 billion to $40 billion of damage. 

Experts caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake's total damage, but it's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums. 

Jack Byrne, the chairman of Fireman's Fund Corp., which is based in Novato, Calif., estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total $2 billion.
The impact on the insurance industry "will be big and harsh, but less than {Hurricane} Hugo," says Mr. Byrne, who toured the Bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company's exposure to the earthquake. 

Mr. Byrne says Fireman's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims, but, after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines, the company's fourthquarter charge against earnings shouldn't top $50 million.
The company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of Northern California showing the exact locations of all the property it insures. 

Fireman's Fund had claims adjusters on the streets of San Francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot.
Fireman's Fund insures 37,300 homes and autos and 35,000 businesses in the Bay area.
In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage, the insurer must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service. 

But many Californians may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property.
The Independent Insurance Agents of America says fewer than one of every five California homeowners has earthquake insurance.
A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay area have bought the additional insurance protection, but the great majority aren't covered. 

Earthquake insurance typically runs $200 or more a year for a small house. 

Whatever the long-term economic effect, the scene from the helicopter above Oakland is one of tragedy.
Gargantuan sections of a double-decker freeway have been heaved about like plastic building blocks.
Atop them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety the day before.
In areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say have been flattened into foot-thick slabs. 

On the periphery, rescue workers seem, from the air, to move in slow motion.
They peck away at the 1 1/2-mile section of rubble, searching for more of the 250 people thought to have died here.
About 20 other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake. 

The heart of the earthquake, 6.9 on the Richter scale, was 50 miles to the south, near Santa Cruz, but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway, a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco.
Along the way, the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz, knocked down buildings in San Francisco's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city's Financial District. 

Just a short span across the bay to the west, the quake also showed its mettle: A four-square-block area of the Marina District lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew.
Many of the buildings, mostly condominiums and apartments, were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil -- much of it landfill -- was literally turned to ooze by the quake's intensive shaking, rupturing gas lines. 

Onlookers say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck.
Efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well.
From the air, ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site.
As onlookers stand behind barricades, helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse. 

In the Marina District, residents spent yesterday assessing damage, cleaning up and trying to find friends and neighbors.
Evelyn Boccone, 85 years old, has lived in the district most of her life.
Her parents lost everything in the 1906 earthquake. "Now, we realize what our mothers must have gone through," she says. "We always heard about the earthquake, but as children we didn't always listen." 

Michael F. Klatman, director of corporate public relations at Data General Corp., was named to the new position of vice president, corporate communications, of this maker of data storage equipment. 

San Francisco area officials gave the media high marks for helping people find shelter and obtain emergency information after Tuesday's catastrophic earthquake. 

"The press has been doing an excellent job.
They are telling people what roads are closed and just keeping the public informed has helped to keep the panic down," said James Ball, a station supervisor at Daly City Police Department. 

Mr. Ball noted that television stations featured people holding up phone books, explaining where to call for help.
Radio stations provided an emergency number for people who smelled gas but didn't know how to turn off their gas supply. 

Kim Schwartz, a spokesperson for the American Red Cross in Los Angeles, said television and radio stations in San Francisco played a "very positive role" by providing the address of 28 shelters of the Red Cross and by giving out the Red Cross number for contributions to help earthquake victims (1-800-453-9000). 

The San Francisco Examiner issued a special edition around noon yesterday that was filled entirely with earthquake news and information.
The Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle were able to publish despite Tuesday's quake, which occurred close to deadline for many newspapers. 

The Wall Street Journal "American Way of Buying" Survey consists of two separate, door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization.
The two surveys, which asked different questions, were conducted using national random probability samples. 

The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30, 1989.
The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15, 1989.
Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data. 

For each poll, the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire, the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1/2 percentage points in either direction.
The margin of error for subgroups -- for example, married women with children at home -- would be larger.
In addition, in any survey, there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings.

Bally Manufacturing Corp. and New York developer Donald Trump have agreed in principle to a $6.5 million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from Bally's alleged greenmail payment to Mr. Trump. 

According to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks, the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in Camden, N.J. 

In February 1987, Bally thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. Trump by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of Mr. Trump's 3.1 million Bally shares for $83.7 million -- more than $18 million above market price.
The term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium over market value to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer. 

Lawyers for shareholders, Bally and Mr. Trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement, citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed. 

But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the $6.5 million payment will be shared by Bally and Mr. Trump, with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money. 

The amount Bally and Mr. Trump will pay to settle the class-action suit pales in comparison to the $45 million Walt Disney Co. and Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings Inc. agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in July.
That settlement represented the first time shareholders were granted a major payment in a greenmail case.
Mr. Steinberg made a $59.7 million profit on the sale to Disney of his investment in the company in 1984. 

But lawyers said Mr. Steinberg probably faced much more potential liability because, when he sued Disney during his takeover battle, he filed on behalf of all shareholders.
When Disney offered to pay Mr. Steinberg a premium for his shares, the New York investor didn't demand the company also pay a premium to other shareholders.
When Mr. Trump sued Bally, he sued only on behalf of himself. 

Mr. Trump and Bally also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of Delaware, where Bally is incorporated, courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule.
That rule gives boards of directors wide latitude in deciding how to deal with dissident shareholders. 

SENATE HEARS final arguments in impeachment trial of federal judge. 

Yesterday, U.S. Judge Alcee Hastings faced his jury -- the full U.S. Senate -- and said, "I am not guilty of having committed any crime." 

Seventeen articles of impeachment against the Florida judge, one of the few blacks on the U.S. bench, were approved by the House in August 1988.
The central charge against Judge Hastings is that he conspired with a Washington lawyer to obtain a $150,000 bribe from defendants in a criminal case before the judge, in return for leniency.
He is also accused of lying under oath and of leaking information obtained from a wiretap he supervised. 

The Senate's public gallery was packed with Judge Hastings' supporters, who erupted into applause after he finished his argument.
Judge Hastings, who was acquitted of similar charges by a federal jury in 1983, claims he is being victimized and that the impeachment proceedings against him constitute double jeopardy. 

But Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas), the lead counsel for the House managers who conducted a lengthy inquiry into Judge Hastings' activities, said "a mountain of evidence points to his certain guilt." 

The Senate will deliberate behind closed doors today and is scheduled to vote on the impeachment tomorrow.
If the judge is impeached, as is thought likely, he will be removed from office immediately. 

However, Judge Hastings has said he will continue to fight and is contemplating an appeal of any impeachment to the U.S. Supreme Court. 

COMPANIES SEEKING to make insurers pay for pollution cleanup win court victory. 

In a case involving Avondale Industries Inc. and its insurer, Travelers Cos., the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country. 

Travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs aren't damages and thus aren't covered under commercial policies.
They also have argued that government proceedings notifying a company of potential responsibility don't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit; thus, such governmental proceedings aren't covered by the policies, the insurers say. 

The appeals court disagreed on both counts.
Avondale was notified by Louisiana officials in 1986 that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an oil-recycling plant.
Avondale asked Travelers to defend it in the state proceeding, but the insurer didn't respond.
The appeals court upheld a district judge's ruling that the insurer had to defend the company in such proceedings. 

The appeals court also said, "We think an ordinary businessman reading this policy would have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage claims" stemming from any cleanup. 

"This decision will have a very considerable impact," said Kenneth Abraham, professor of environmental law and insurance law at the University of Virginia, because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in New York. 

William Greaney, an attorney for the Chemical Manufacturers Association, said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages, the influence of the appeals court in New York "will make insurers sit up and listen." He said the decision was the first in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation. 

Barry R. Ostrager, an attorney for Travelers, said, "there are procedural bases on which this case will be appealed further." 

NEW YORK'S poor face nearly three million legal problems a year without legal help. 

That is the conclusion of a report released by the New York State Bar Association.
The report was based on a telephone survey of 1,250 low-income households across the state, a mail survey of major legal-services programs and on-site interviews with individuals in the field. 

"The report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions," said Joseph Genova, chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. 

According to the study, slightly more than 34% of those surveyed reported having at least one housing problem every year for which they had no legal help.
Nearly 36% ranked housing problems as their most serious unmet legal need.
Other areas targeted by the survey's respondents included difficulty obtaining or maintaining public benefits (22%), consumer fraud (15.4%), and health-care issues (15%). 

During the 15-month survey, 43% of all legal-services programs said that at some period they were unable to accept new clients unless they had an emergency. 

Mr. Genova said the committee may meet to propose solutions to the problems identified in the study.

Georgia Gulf Corp., hurt by declining sales and falling chemical prices, said third-quarter earnings fell 13% to $46.1 million from $53.1 million in the year-earlier period. 

Sales declined 10% to $251.2 million from $278.7 million. 

The Atlanta-based chemical manufacturer said lower prices hurt margins for most products. "We did see some relief in raw material costs, but it wasn't sufficient to offset the drop in sales prices," James R. Kuse, the company's chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement. 

On a per-share basis, quarterly earnings remained at $1.85, the same as last year, because of the company's share buy-back program.
Georgia Gulf had 24.9 million shares outstanding on average in the quarter, compared with 28.6 million in the third quarter of 1988, adjusted for a stock split paid in January 1989. 

In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, stock in Georgia Gulf, which has been mentioned as a takeover candidate, rose $2.125 a share to close at $46.125. 

Gen. Paul X. Kelley, retired commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, was elected a director of this plastics, specialty materials and aerospace concern, succeeding Jewel Lafontant, who resigned to accept a government position. 

Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake. 

Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's claims division. 

But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers.
Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks posted strong gains. 

Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage.
Most insurers already have mobilized their "catastrophe" teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California. 

Since commercial air travel is interrupted, Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area.
About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks. 

Some adjusters, already in other parts of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers. 

Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims. 

State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest home and auto insurer in California, believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo.
State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ind., is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California. 

Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement "rider" on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes.
State Farm said about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance.
Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., said about 23% of its personal property policyholders -- about 28% in the San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage. 

The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total $500 million, but only $100 million to $150 million is insured, it said. 

Officials from the American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today.
They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two. 

Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage.
Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage.
Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds. 

However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have "loss of income" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days.
That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based in Philadelphia. 

Earthquake-related claims aren't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole.
Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear. 

Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways.
For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy.
Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise.
Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves. 

"We are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace," said William Yankus, an analyst with Conning & Co., a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry.
His firm, along with some others, issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday. 

Among the insurance stocks, big gainers included American International Group, up $3.25 to $102.625; General Re Corp., up $2.75 to $86.50; Aetna, up $2.375 to $59.50; and Marsh & McLennan Inc., up $3.125 to $75.875. 

Still, a few individual companies, most likely smaller ones, could be devastated. "I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this," said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult.
He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo. 

British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster.
Although it's unclear how much exposure the London market will face, U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage.
Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates to soar. 

The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire.
Orin Kramer, an insurance consultant in New York, estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, included insured losses of $5.8 billion.
He is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo. 

Program traders were buying and selling at full steam Monday, the first trading session after the stock market's 190.58-point plunge Friday. 

They accounted for a hefty 16% of New York Stock Exchange volume Monday, the fourth busiest session ever.
On Friday, 13% of volume was in computer-guided program trades.
In August, by contrast, program trading averaged 10.3% of daily Big Board turnover. 

Program traders were publicly castigated following the 508-point crash Oct. 19, 1987, and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while.
But as the outcry faded by the spring of 1988, they resumed.
Some observers thought that after Friday's sharp drop, the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid stoking more controversy. 

But the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort.
One reason, they said, was that the official reports on the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a cause. 

Stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves, if not actually causing them.
In it, traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies.
Under the exchange's definitions, program trading also describes a number of other strategies that, in the opinion of some traders, don't cause big swings in the market. 

The Big Board's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual.
Though it collects such data daily, its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends.
The September figures are due to be released this week. 

The Big Board declined to name the Wall Street firms involved in the activity Friday and Monday, or the type of strategies used.
But traders on the exchange floor, who can observe the computer-guided trading activity on monitor screens, said most of the top program-trading firms were active both days. 

Through August, the top five program trading firms in volume were Morgan Stanley & Co., Kidder, Peabody & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc. 

Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading, one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record.
Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady Commission report, they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed Monday to restore the markets' equilibrium. 

On Friday, the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract -- a "circuit breaker" procedure instituted after the 1987 crash and implemented for the first time.
Futures trading resumed a half-hour later, but the session ended shortly thereafter, leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs, traders said.
By Monday morning, they said, stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped re-establish the link between stocks and futures. 

But stunning volatility was produced in the process.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged a breathtaking 63.52 points in the first 40 minutes of trading Monday as stock-index arbitrage sell programs kicked in.
At about 10:10 a.m. EDT, the market abruptly turned upward on stock-index arbitrage buy programs.
By day's end, the Dow industrials had rebounded 88.12 points, or nearly half of Friday's drop. 

NEWHALL LAND & FARMING Co., Valencia, Calif., announced a 2-for-1 split in the real estate limited partnership's units and increased its regular quarterly cash distribution 33%, to 40 cents a unit.
The real estate limited partnership also said it will pay a special year-end cash distribution of 10 cents a unit.
Both distributions are payable Dec. 4 to limited partners of record Nov. 3. 

Wang Laboratories Inc., Lowell, Mass., beset by declining demand for its computers, reported a $62.1 million, 38-cents-a-share loss in its first quarter ended Sept. 30.
Revenue fell 12.7% to $596.8 million from $684 million, although some of the decline was caused by discontinued operations. 

Wang had previously forecast a loss.
The company reiterated that it expects another loss in the second quarter and for the full year, although it expects a profitable fourth quarter. 

A year ago, Wang had earnings of $13.1 million, or eight cents a share, in its first quarter, including a $3.1 million loss from discontinued operations.
The latest period loss included a $12.9 pretax charge for severance payments. 

G.D. Searle & Co., a Monsanto Co. unit, is launching a program to give consumers more information about its drugs when doctors prescribe them. 

Called Patients in the Know, the program features fact sheets designed to be easy to understand.
The sheets tell how the medicine works, describe how to use it and list its possible side effects.
They are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions.
In addition, Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores. 

Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients. "We believe that every drug that's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label," said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Ralph Nader affiliate.
Dr. Teich said Searle is "the only company I know that voluntarily" will make consumer information available. 

According to federal officials and drug-industry studies, nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year aren't used properly, meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication. "We think it's very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs consumers take," said Searle Chairman Sheldon Gilgore. 

Federal Paper Board Co. said it completed the previously announced purchase of Imperial Cup Corp., a closely held maker of paper cups based in Kenton, Ohio.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Imperial Cup has annual sales of approximately $75 million.
Federal Paper Board sells paper and wood products. 

B.A.T Industries PLC may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan -- including the sale of its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field units -- in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets, company officials said. 

The British conglomerate, planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a #13.35 billion ($21.03 billion) takeover bid by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures.
If anything, the gyrations in world stock markets -- and in B.A.T's share price -- since last Friday's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring, analysts and several big institutional holders said. "Thank God we have some deal on the table," said Stewart Gilchrist, a director at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, which intends to vote its roughly 1% stake in favor of the restructuring. 

Investors in B.A.T have been on a roller coaster.
B.A.T has been London's best-performing blue chip over the past six months, up 40% against a 4% rise in the Financial Times 100-Share Index.
But this week, B.A.T has been hit harder than other big U.K. stocks -- first by the market gyrations, then by Tuesday's San Francisco earthquake, which could leave B.A.T's Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit facing big claims.
B.A.T rose five pence (eight cents) to 756 pence ($11.91) in London yesterday as a late market rally erased a 28-pence fall earlier in the day. 

To fight off predators, B.A.T plans to spin off about $6 billion in assets, largely by selling such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks and by floating its big paper and U.K. retailing business via share issues to existing holders.
Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10% of its shares and a 50% dividend increase. 

"I think the restructuring will get the required support," said Michael Pacitti, an analyst at London stockbroker UBS Phillips & Drew. "The shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back." 

But B.A.T's restructuring, which was never going to happen quickly, now will take longer because of the market upheaval.
Company officials, holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next year's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half. "We aren't forced sellers.
We don't have an absolute deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time," to take particular steps, said Michael Prideaux, a B.A.T spokesman. 

Even if B.A.T receives approval for the restructuring, the company will remain in play, say shareholders and analysts, though the situation may unfold over the next 12 months, rather than six.
The new B.A.T will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services hybrid whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower-growth tobacco business than the higher-multiple financial-services business, these holders believe.
Thus B.A.T's restructuring may only make the company a more manageable target for other corporate predators -- possibly such acquisitive bidders as Hanson PLC. 

"The last few days will surely slow down the pace of events," says Scottish Amicable's Mr. Gilchrist. "But I wouldn't write off" Sir James or other potential bidders. 

Among possible delays, the sales of Saks and Marshall Field -- which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season -- may slide into the second quarter or second half.
Analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly $2 billion. 

B.A.T isn't predicting a postponement because the units "are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries," said Mr. Prideaux.
But the delay could happen if B.A.T doesn't get adequate bids, he said. 

People familiar with B.A.T say possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains, and General Cinema Corp., which is interested in bidding for Saks.
Other potential bidders for parts of B.A.T's U.S. retail unit include Dillard Department Stores Inc., May Department Stores Co. and Limited Inc. B.A.T has declined to identify the potential bidders. 

Though Sir James has said he intends to mount a new bid for B.A.T once approval from U.S. insurance regulators is received, jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and U.S. leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about Sir James's prospects.
His initial offer indicated he needed to raise as much as 80% of the takeover financing through the debt markets. 

Market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for B.A.T's attracting a premium price for its U.S. retailing properties.
Finally, Tuesday's California earthquake initially knocked 3.7% off B.A.T's share price in London yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to Los Angeles-based Farmers, which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in California. 

On Farmers, Mr. Prideaux said it is too early to quantify the level of potential claims.
He added B.A.T "has no expectation of a material impact on Farmers." 

The average publicly offered commodity fund fell 4.2% in September, largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies, according to Norwood Securities. 

The firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the 122 funds it tracks.
For the first nine months of the year, Norwood said the average fund has lost 3.3%. 

Japan Air Lines, Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year, a move that could further consolidate the industry. 

Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems.
They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen ($140 million) in the venture, whose headquarters would be in France or West Germany. 

The action follows Federal Express Corp. 's acquisition of Flying Tiger Line Inc. in August.
After that, "it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly," said Cotton Daly, director of cargo services for New York consulting firm Simat, Helliesen & Eichner Inc. 

Mr. Daly said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by Federal Express, United Parcel Service of America Inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies.
Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures, and there have been rumors about such a tie between JAL and European airlines. 

In Tokyo, a JAL spokesman said he couldn't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report.
But he said JAL is talking to Lufthansa and Air France about some sort of cargo venture. "It is just one of a number of strategies JAL has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in Europe after 1992," the deadline for ending trade barriers in the EC, he said. 

In Frankfurt, a Lufthansa spokesman confirmed talks are under way, but declined to comment.
A Lufthansa spokeswoman in Tokyo said the head of Lufthansa's cargo operations had been in Toyko last week for talks with JAL.
In Paris, Air France declined to comment. 

"Nothing is defined or signed at this point," Mr. Daly said of the talks.
Whatever accord the three carriers reach, he said, he is skeptical it would create a separate airline. 

If the three companies pool their air-freight businesses, their clout would be considerable.
According to figures from the International Air Transport Association, they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year.
Federal Express and Flying Tiger, as separate companies, carried a combined 2.6 million tons. 

Air France and Lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities.
They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo.
Other airlines would have access to the system, they said, and negotiations with partners were already under way. 

Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of Boeing 747 freighters and 747 Combis, aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck.
They currently have large orders for cargo planes. 

Several airlines, including Lufthansa, JAL and Cathay Pacific Airways, are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join, Mr. Daly said. 

JAL also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in Europe before the end of 1992.
Last month, the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from British Airways so it could funnel its passengers from London to other European destinations. 

British Airways said it hasn't received a proposal from JAL.
But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the U.K. and Japan, a likely first step to any commercial agreement between JAL and British Airways or another U.K. carrier. 

Consolidated Rail Corp., New York, reported that third-quarter net income climbed 4.8% to $87 million, or $1.27 a share, exceeding analysts' expectations. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the freight railroad earned $83 million, or $1.21 a share.
James A. Hagen, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that earnings advanced "in the face of a drop in business, brought on by the general economic slowdown." Revenue slipped 4.6% to $835 million from $876 million. 

For the rest of 1989, Mr. Hagen said, Conrail's traffic and revenue "will reflect the sluggish economy, but Conrail will continue to take steps to control and reduce costs." 

For the nine months, Conrail earnings grew 0.4% to $229 million, or $3.34 a share, from $228 million, or $3.31 a share.
Revenue was flat at $2.59 billion. 

The Berlin Wall still stands.
But the man who built it has fallen. 

East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker, one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world, in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens.
But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc, it hardly ushers in an era of reform -- at least anytime soon. 

For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker, who had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus, with a man cut of the same cloth: Egon Krenz, the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege.
East Germany, it is clear, is no Poland, where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union.
Nor is it a Hungary, where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy. 

Still, any change in East Germany has enormous implications, for both East and West.
It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow, Washington and Western Europe. 

Mr. Krenz, 52, was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin.
Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for "health reasons," West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday. (Mr.
Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media.) 

ADN said Mr. Honecker, a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall, also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military.
Mr. Krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation's parliament convenes later this week. 

Mr. Honecker's ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. Honecker, now 77 years old, built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc.
His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen, dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule, fled to the West.
Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in East Germany's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers' uprising in 1953. 

In Washington, the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change.
The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. Krenz, provided he is willing to institute reforms.
But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer. 

President Bush told reporters: "Whether that {the leadership change} reflects a change in East-West relations, I don't think so.
Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker." One top U.S. expert on East Germany added: "There is no clear-cut champion of reform, that we know of, in the East German leadership." 

Indeed, Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups.
He said, while dialogue is important, enough forums already exist "in which different interests" can express themselves. 

The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party.
According to West German government sources, Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change.
But, with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity, Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle, officials say.
Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag, who has long headed economic affairs, and Joachim Hermann, chief of information policy.
Both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday. 

Although other resignations may follow, it's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government's resistance to fundamental change.
Clearly, the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz.
Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland, he was eight years old when World War II ended.
Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany's division. 

Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member, Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname "crown prince," a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker.
In fact, the two men have had strikingly similar career paths, both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position. 

Moreover, both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy.
Notably, one of Mr. Krenz's few official visits overseas came a few months ago, when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing.
He later defended the Chinese government's response during a separate visit to West Germany.
East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz, in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church. 

However, Mr. Krenz also has a reputation for being politically savvy.
His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in East Germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor, Mr. Honecker.
Indeed, according to West German government sources, he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled Mr. Honecker.
In recent days, Mr. Krenz has sought to project a kinder image.
According to a report widely circulating in East Berlin, it was Mr. Krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in Leipzig. 

"He doesn't want to have the image of the gun man," says Fred Oldenburg, an expert at the Bonn-sponsored Institute of East European and International Studies in Cologne. "He's not a reformer -- he wants to have the image of a reformer." 

As part of his image polishing, Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party's authority.
Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker, Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media, free up travel restrictions, and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups. 

But will it be enough?
West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful. "He doesn't signify what people want, so the unrest will go on," Mr. Oldenburg predicts. 

At the same time, the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow.
Says one West German official: "What's necessary now is the process of democratization.
Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously." 

Chancellor Kohl, meanwhile, has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects.
Reports in the West German press, citing sources in East Germany, suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader.
Adding to that speculation is Mr. Krenz's reputation as a heavy drinker, who is said to also suffer from diabetes. "This is a dynamic process and we're experiencing the first step," the Bonn official adds.
The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in East Germany's rigid stance.
Two reform-minded party leaders favored by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker, Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, were passed over.
If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify. 

In Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev sent Mr. Krenz a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change.
According to the Soviet news agency Tass, "Gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of {East} Germany, being sensitive to the demands of the time, . . . will find solutions to complicated problems the GDR {German Democratic Republic} encountered." 

A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country.
The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they didn't. 

From the perspective of East Germany's old guard, reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country's reason for being.
Unlike the other nations of the bloc, East Germany is a creature of the Cold War.
Erasing the differences still dividing Europe, and the vast international reordering that implies, won't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary.
But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map.
Which is what the Old Guard fears. "I'm sure they'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR's future as a separately identifiable state," says Michael Simmons, a British journalist whose book on East Germany, entitled "The Unloved Country," was published this month. 

Up to now, that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country's international legitimacy, followed by Mr. Honecker's campaign to build the East bloc's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise.
Neither man achieved perfection. 

Early in 1987, Mr. Honecker and his team stopped paying thin compliments to Mr. Gorbachev and joined with Romania in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems.
The less-self-confident Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians, in contrast, declared their intentions to reform, while doing nothing concrete about it. 

The East German media soon began presenting Mr. Gorbachev's speeches only as sketchy summaries, and giving space to his opponents.
By late 1988, they were banning Soviet publications. 

The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road.
Mr. Honecker spoke of "generally valid objective laws of socialism" and left no room for debate. 

With this year's dislocations in China and the Soviet Union, and the drive to democracy in Poland and Hungary, the East German leadership grew still more defensive.
Politburo member Joachim Herrman confessed to a "grave concern" over Hungarian democracy. "Under the banner that proclaims the `renewal of socialism, '" he said, "forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism." 

Some loyal voices, in and out of the East German Communist party, saw the nation's unrest coming.
The first signs were economic.
Despite heavily subsidized consumer industries, East Germans have for years watched the West pull farther out ahead.
In 1988, for the first time, economic growth came to a dead stop. 

Gingerly, some economists began to blame central planning.
Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy, at least in the workplace.
By summer, an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before. 

But they are stalwart socialists.
Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse East Germany of its Stalinist muck, not to merge with the West.
One of their pastors has envisioned a "new utopia" of "creative socialism." 

Meanwhile, the man Mr. Krenz replaces has left an indelible mark on East German society.
Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs, Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow. 

He was a "socialist warrior" who felt rankled by West Germany's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state.
Finally, during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago, he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought.
But ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade, Mr. Gorbachev. 

Mr. Honecker's removal "was bound to happen," says one aide to Chancellor Kohl. "It was only a matter of time." 

The European Community Commission increased its forecast for economic growth in the EC in 1989 to 3.5%, slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25%. 

In its annual economic report for 1989-1990, the commission also projected 1990 gross domestic product growth for the 12 EC members at 3%.
EC inflation was seen at 4.8% in 1989, higher than 1988's 3.6% price rise.
However, inflation for 1990 was seen slowing to 4.5%. 

Leading EC growth forecasts in 1989 was Ireland, seen growing 5% at constant prices.
Slower growth countries included Greece, at 2.5%, the U.K., at 2.25%, and Denmark, at 1.75%. 

Inflation is expected to be highest in Greece, where it is projected at 14.25%, and Portugal, at 13%.
At the other end of the spectrum, West German inflation was forecast at 3% in 1989 and 2.75% in 1990. 

Nestle Korea Ltd. opened a coffee and non-dairy-creamer plant in Chongju, South Korea.
An official at Nestle Korea, a 50-50 joint venture between Nestle S.A. and the Doosan Group, said the new facility will manufacture all types of soluble, roasted and ground coffee, coffee mix and nondairy coffee creamer.
The South Korean coffee market, consisting mostly of instant coffee, was estimated at about 100 billion won ($150.7 million) last year.
Brands made by the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. had about 95% of the market share.
Nestle currently has only about a 2% share with its Taster's Choice coffee. 

Poland plans to start negotiations soon on purchasing natural gas from Iran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
The agency said Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi of Poland's willingess to purchase the gas during Mr. Vaezi's current visit to Warsaw.
The agency didn't mention possible quantities and didn't say how the gas would be delivered. 

A Chinese official harshly criticized plans to close a British naval base in downtown Hong Kong.
Hong Kong officials announced last week that the base will be relocated to a small island to allow downtown redevelopment.
But Beijing wants to use the base for the People's Liberation Army after 1997, when the territory returns to Chinese sovereignty.
Ke Zaishuo, head of China's delegation to a Chinese-British Liaison Committee on Hong Kong, accused Britain of trying to impose a fait accompli and said, "This is something we cannot accept." 

The Israeli and Soviet national airlines have reached preliminary agreement for launching the first direct flights between Tel Aviv and Moscow, a spokesman for the Israeli airline, El Al, said.
El Al director Rafi Har-Lev and top officials of the Soviet Union's Aeroflot negotiated a preliminary pact in Moscow this week, the spokesman said.
He added that concluding the deal requires approval by the governments of both countries, which have never had direct air links. 

The chairman and a director of one of the Republic of Singapore's leading property companies, City Development Ltd., or CDL, were charged yesterday with criminal breach of trust of some 800,000 Singapore dollars (about US$409,000). 

Kwek Hong Png, chairman of CDL, and director Quek Leng Chye were arrested by the republic's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Tuesday night.
In addition to abetting in the alleged criminal breach of trust, Kwek Hong Png was also charged with dishonestly receiving S$500,000 that had been stolen.
Both men were charged in a subordinate court and released on bail of S$1 million. 

The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning CDL that have depressed the company's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by CDL's controlling Quek family, brokers in Singapore say.
The Queks control the Hong Leong Group, which has widespread interests in manufacturing, property and finance in both Malaysia and Singapore. 

News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the Singapore Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday, but brokers said that the market and CDL shares recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally. 

One of the two British companies still making hard toilet paper stopped production of it.
British Tissues decided to do away with its hard paper after a major customer, British Rail, switched to softer tissues for train bathrooms. . . . Peasants in Inner Mongolia have partly dismantled a 20-mile section of China's famed Great Wall, the official People's Daily said.
The paper said the bricks were used to build homes and furnaces and, as a result, the wall "is in terrible shape." 

L.J. Hooker Corp. is expected to reach an agreement in principle this week to sell Merksamer Jewelers Inc. to management, say executives familiar with the talks. 

L.J. Hooker, based in Atlanta, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year.
Currently, its parent company, Hooker Corp. of Sydney, Australia, is being managed by a court-appointed liquidator. 

It is expected that GE Capital Corp., a financial-services subsidiary of General Electric Co., will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy-out of Merksamer, based in Sacramento, Calif.
A spokesman for GE Capital declined to comment. 

GE Capital has a working relationship with L.J. Hooker.
It is providing $50 million in emergency financing to the company and has agreed to buy as much as $75 million in receivables from B. Altman & Co. and Bonwit Teller, L.J. Hooker's two fully owned department-store chains. 

Sam Merksamer, chief executive officer of the nationwide jewelry chain, and Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker Corp., both declined to comment. 

Currently, Mr. Merksamer owns 20% of the company; L.J. Hooker acquired its 80% interest in the firm in May 1986.
At the time, the Merksamer chain had 11 stores in operation.
Today, there are 77 units, all located in shopping malls. 

In recent weeks Mr. Merksamer has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them to provide letters of intent saying they will continue shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy-out, say those familiar with the situation.
This year, a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed, causing jitters among suppliers, and Mr. Merksamer apparently wanted assurances that he won't have delivery problems. 

For the year ended June 30, 1989, Merksamer Jewelers had $62 million of revenue and operating profit of $2.5 million. 

The jewelery chain was put up for sale in June.
According to those familiar with the situation, other bidders included Ratners Group PLC of London and Kay Jewelers Inc. First Boston Corp. is advising L.J. Hooker on the sale of the Merksamer business. 

Merksamer was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made by L.J. Hooker.
The company was founded in Sacramento in 1929 by two brothers, Ralph and Walter Merksamer, who operated as DeVon's Jewelers.
In 1979, the pair split the company in half, with Walter and his son, Sam, agreeing to operate under the Merksamer Jewelery name. 

The sale of Merksamer Jewelers is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 

As earlier reported, L.J. Hooker this week received a $409 million bid for its three shopping malls, plus other properties from a consortium led by Honolulu real-estate investor Jay Shidler and A. Boyd Simpson, an Atlanta developer and former L.J. Hooker senior executive.
The offer, which didn't include the Merksamer chain, is being reviewed by Mr. Sigoloff. 

Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) said he and Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) are backing away from their proposal to make the Treasury Secretary a voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy. 

Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget. 

The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank's independence.
Fed critics, however, hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy. 

Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to "improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed." 

Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
The administration officials don't ordinarily meet with the entire membership of the open market committee. 

B.F. Goodrich Co. said third-quarter profits dropped 34% because of lower prices for polyvinyl chloride materials, the company's largest product group. 

Net fell to $40.1 million, or $1.50 a share, from $60.7 million, or $2.32 a share, a year earlier.
Sales for the quarter slipped 2.7% to $601.3 million from $618.1 million. 

Polyvinyl chloride capacity "has overtaken demand and we are experiencing reduced profit margins as a result," said John D. Ong, chairman and chief executive.
Prices for general-purpose PVC resin have dropped more than 15% since last December, he said.
The plastic resin is used in a wide range of products, including siding, pipe and electrical wire insulation. 

Goodrich's vinyl-products segment reported operating profit for the quarter of $30.1 million, less than half the $64.1 million of the year-earlier quarter.
Third-quarter operating profit of the specialty-chemicals group declined slightly to $24.3 million from $24.9 million.
But operating profit from aerospace products rose nearly 50% to $15 million from $10.1 million. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of the Akron, Ohio-based company fell $1.375 to $49.125. 

Unilab Corp., Norcross, Ga., said it acquired the clinical laboratories of closely held Central Diagnostic Laboratory Inc. in a cash and securities transaction valued at $85 million. 

Unilab said its wholly owned MetWest Inc. unit paid $25 million in cash, provided $30 million in notes and $30 million in preferred stock to acquire Central's labs in the Western U.S. 

Unilab, which provides clinical laboratory services, competed with Central, based in Tarzana, Calif., in a number of areas.
Beyond removing a competitor, the combination should provide "synergies," said Fred Harlow, Unilab's chief financial officer.
It also will hand Unilab new markets.
In Los Angeles, for example, Central has had a strong market position while Unilab's presence has been less prominent, according to Mr. Harlow. 

BroadBeach Associates Inc., the Los Angeles investment partnership whose $62-a-share bid for McGill Manufacturing Co. was topped recently by a competing offer from a Swedish concern, disclosed that it sold its entire 7% McGill stake. 

McGill, a Valparaiso, Ind., ball-bearing manufacturer, had rebuffed BroadBeach's proposal.
It has since asked holders not to immediately tender their shares under a recent $72-a-share, or $104 million, bid from AB SKF of Sweden, until McGill directors have completed their evaluation. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, BroadBeach said it sold the 101,000 McGill shares for $7.3 million in a private transaction on Oct. 12.
BroadBeach didn't identify the buyer of the shares, but the date of the selloff followed by one day the Swedish concern's tender offer, and the indicated price of the shares sold equals SKF's $72-a-share tender offer price. 

A BroadBeach spokeswoman said the company sold the stock in the open market and thus couldn't identify the buyer or buyers. 

William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said Lincoln Savings & Loan Association should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion. 

Mr. Seidman, who has been the nation's top bank regulator, inherited the problems of Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law.
He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry.
The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr., who is chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent, and who contributed heavily to several U.S. senators. 

Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created to sell sick thrifts, has studied Lincoln's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986. "My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions, we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations," Mr. Seidman said. 

When Lincoln was seized by the government, for example, 15% of its loans, or $250 million, were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental's 50 other subsidiaries, according to Mr. Seidman. 

But the government didn't step in until six months ago, when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.
The bankruptcy filing, the government has charged in a $1.1 billion civil lawsuit, was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company, which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals.
The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. "I think it's fairly clear {Mr.
Keating} knew," that regulators were set to seize Lincoln, Mr. Seidman said. 

Further investigation, he said, may result in further actions against Lincoln's executives, said Mr. Seidman, "including fraud actions." Mr. Keating, for his part, has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift. 

Leonard Bickwit, an attorney in Washington for Mr. Keating, declined to comment on the hearings, except to say, "We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time." 

Lincoln's treatment by former thrift regulators, in an agency disbanded by the new law, has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. Keating.
Mr. Seidman said yesterday, for example, that Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), who received $48,100 in contributions from Mr. Keating, phoned Mr. Seidman to request that he push for a sale of Lincoln before it would be seized. 

After the government lawsuit was filed against Lincoln, Sen. DeConcini returned the campaign contributions.
The senator's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because "hundreds of Arizona jobs {at Lincoln} were on the line." 

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) has also returned contributions he received from Mr. Keating a year ago.
Sens.
John Glenn (D., Ohio), John McCain, (R., Ariz.) and Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln. 

House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) said Sen. Cranston volunteered to appear before the House committee, if necessary.
But a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators. 

At the hearing, Mr. Seidman said the RTC has already pumped $729 million into Lincoln for liquidity.
He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $225 million in American Continental subordinated debt.
Some of those debtholders have filed a suit, saying they believed they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit. "We have no plans at this time to pay off those notes," he said. 

Microsoft Corp. 's earnings growth continued to outstrip that of most of its competitors and customers in the personal-computer industry, as it reported a 36% jump in fiscal first-quarter earnings on a 33% revenue gain. 

The Redmond, Wash. company, a bellwether provider of operating systems and software for personal-computer makers and users, reported net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 of $49.6 million, or 87 cents a share, up from $36.6 million, or 65 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
Revenue rose to $235.2 million, from $176.4 million. 

Microsoft previously indicated it would have a strong quarter by forecasting its revenue gain on Oct. 4, causing a $6.50 a share jump in its stock.
But its stock jumped again yesterday as it disclosed surprisingly strong margins on those sales. 

Microsoft's stock rose $2.875 a share in national over-the-counter trading to $78.625.
The stock had hit a high of $81 a share early last week but collapsed to $73.50 in the Friday stock plunge. 

The company had been experiencing softening margins because of increased sales of software applications, which have lower margins than do operating systems.
But the company said that trend was offset in the first quarter by better economies of scale and efficiencies in manufacturing. 

As a result, Microsoft's cost of goods, as a percentage of sales, fell 17% from the year-ago quarter and 13% from the previous period.
The trend drove up the aftertax margin -- net income as a percentage of revenues -- to 21.1% in the quarter, compared with 20.7% a year earlier. 

Microsoft officials said the strong results also reflected continuing high demand for its software applications and operating systems.
While it has predicted that overall growth in unit sales of personal computers is slowing to about a 10% yearly rate, its own products are selling at a much faster rate because many are geared to the high-performance end of the market.
That segment continues to post strong quarter-to-quarter gains, while the low-end, or commodity segment, of the industry is experiencing sluggish growth or even sales declines. 

Compared with its previous quarter, the final period of its 1989 fiscal year, net rose 9%, and sales rose 7%. 

UPJOHN Co. reported that third-quarter net income rose to $96 million, or 52 cents a share, from $89.6 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.
Yesterday's edition provided analysts' estimates for the company when actual earnings were available. 

Rockwell International Corp. 's Tulsa unit said it signed a tentative agreement extending its contract with Boeing Co. to provide structural parts for Boeing's 747 jetliners. 

Rockwell said the agreement calls for it to supply 200 additional so-called shipsets for the planes.
These include, among other parts, each jetliner's two major bulkheads, a pressure floor, torque box, fixed leading edges for the wings and an aft keel beam. 

Under the existing contract, Rockwell said, it has already delivered 793 of the shipsets to Boeing.
Rockwell, based in El Segundo, Calif., is an aerospace, electronics, automotive and graphics concern. 

HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before 1990 are weakening. 

The method of calculating the 20% tax, paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way, is due for a change in 1990, thanks to 1986's tax act.
But most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity; they have been trying to head it off this year.
Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski backed a simplification plan in the pending House tax bill, but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser. 

Now the Senate's stripped-down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax.
Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning. "We hear it has low priority on the House side," says Samuel Starr of Coopers & Lybrand, CPAs.
If the law isn't changed, he says, "we are left staring at rules that are almost impossible to implement, because there are so many complex depreciation calculations to do." 

But Congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next, Starr adds. 

HUGO'S RAVAGES may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds. 

This law aids hurricane-wracked locales named by the president as disaster areas, as well as regions so designated after other 1989 disasters.
It lets victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either 1989 or amended 1988 returns, whichever offers the larger tax benefit; they have until April 16 to choose.
Amending a 1988 return to claim a refund brings cash faster; but for personal losses, there are other factors to consider, notes publisher Prentice Hall. 

A loss -- after insurance recoveries -- is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds $100 and that the year's total losses exceed 10% of adjusted gross income; victims may pick the year when income is lower and deductions higher.
In filing an original (not amended) return, a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately. 

THE IRS DELAYS several deadlines for Hugo's victims. 

Returns for 1988 from people with six-month filing extensions were due Monday, but the IRS says people in the disaster areas won't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked "Hugo" and postmarked by Jan. 16.
Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes, but late-payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is 10% or less of the liability.
IRS Notice 89-136 describes this and other deadline relief for Hugo's victims. 

Among the provisions: Fiscal-year taxpayers with returns due last Monday won't be penalized if they file -- or request an extension -- and pay tax due by Nov. 15.
Excise-tax returns due by Oct. 31 or Nov. 30 may be delayed to Jan. 16.
Extensions can't be granted for filing employment-tax returns due Oct. 31 or for depositing withheld taxes, but late penalties will be abated for deposits made by Nov. 15. 

The notice also grants relief for certain estate-tax returns. 

ONE-DAY JAUNTS in a chartered boat were perks for permanent staffers of American Business Service Corp., a Costa Mesa, Calif., supplier of temporary workers.
The IRS denied cost deductions because few of the temps got to go aboard.
But the Tax Court said the limitations were reasonable and realistic and allowed the deductions. 

USED-CAR BUYERS who try to avoid sales tax by understating prices paid in private deals are the targets of a New York drive.
Estimating that the state may lose $15 million a year, officials announced the filing of 15 criminal actions and "hundreds" of civil penalties. 

WHEN AN IRA OWNER dies, the trustee of the individual retirement account must file forms 5498 reporting market values relating to the decedent and each beneficiary, with copies to the executor and beneficiaries.
IRS Revenue Procedure 89-52 describes the reporting requirements. 

BIGGER THAN A BREADBOX was this cash hoarder's reputation for honesty. 

People often cite frugality and distrust of banks to justify cash caches to the IRS. Gregory Damonne Brown of Fremont, Calif., a hardworking, reclusive young bachelor, told that story to the Tax Court.
But judges usually find the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income; and the IRS said Brown must have had such income -- although it uncovered no source -- because he deposited $124,732 in a bank account in 1982-84 while reporting income of only $52,012. 

Brown's story: The deposits came from savings kept in a Tupperware breadbox; he saved $47,000 in 1974-81 by living with family members and pinching pennies and $45,000 of secret gifts from his remorseful father, who had abandoned the family in 1955.
Brown had no proof; but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex-employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that Brown was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible. 

The IRS offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income, so Judge Shields rejected its claims. 

BRIEFS: Asked how he made charitable gifts of $26,350 out of reported two-year income of $46,892, Thomas H. McFall of Bryan, Texas, told the Tax Court he had understated his income.
The court rejected his incredible claims, denied his deductions, and imposed a negligence penalty. . . . Rep. Schaefer (R., Colo.) entered a bill to exempt from tax rewards for tips leading to the arrest of violent criminals. 

Michael A. Gaskin, 55 years old, was named president and chief executive officer of this manufacturer of industrial robots, succeeding Walter K. Weisel.
Mr. Weisel, 49, resigned as president and chief executive and will work on special projects, said John J. Wallace, chairman.
Mr. Gaskin formerly was president and chief executive of Taylor & Gaskin Inc. and was a director of Prab Robots since 1985. 

Procter & Gamble Co., Cincinnati, expanding its presence in the food service market, said it acquired Maryland Club Foods, a coffee supplier, from an investor group led by F. Philip Handy of Winter Park, Fla.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Houston-based Maryland Club Foods, which had sales of about $200 million last year, sells coffee under the Maryland Club and Butter-Nut brands to restaurants, hotels, offices and airlines.
The acquisition "gives us additional production capacity for the food service coffee business and a stronger distribution network," a P&G spokesman said. 

P&G already sells its Folgers ground roast coffee to food service concerns, but not to as many markets as Maryland Club.
For example, P&G up until now hasn't sold coffee to airlines and does only limited business with hotels and large restaurant chains. 

Maryland Club also distributes tea, which fits well with P&G's Tender Leaf brand, and hot cocoa products. 

The company said the acquisition has been completed and reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission.
The purchase includes a coffee-roasting plant in Omaha, Neb., and a leased facility in Houston. 

Fiat S.p.
A., Italy's leading industrial group, is conducting "concrete" talks with West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG on a series of projects in the aerospace sector, Fiat officials said. 

However, the officials said it was too early to disclose the nature of the proposed projects or indicate when the talks might be concluded. 

Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter told Milan's financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore that talks are taking place between both companies' aerospace units. 

"While Mr. Reuter's comments please us very much, there currently are no talks in progress regarding the automotive industry," a Fiat spokeswoman said. 

In the interview, Mr. Reuter said he is thinking foremost of cooperation in the truck sector, but "in the long run, I don't want to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars." 

Roberto Morelli, Italy analyst for County Natwest Securities in London, said that right now "the market isn't being influenced by that kind of news," referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned by Mr. Reuter and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock exchanges this week. 

Certainly conservative environmentalists can defend their limited government position by differentiating between Old Environmentalism and New Environmentalism ("Journalists and Others for Saving the Planet," by David Brooks, editorial page, Oct. 5). 

Old Environmentalism involved microbe hunters and sanitationists.
It started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable soap and washable underwear during the Industrial Revolution.
Then cast-iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage- and water-treatment plants toward the end of the 19th century.
Medicine in the 19th century was dedicated mostly to combating sepsis and diagnostic analysis.
Then the 20th century saw the evolution of private-sector wonder drugs, which promulgated medical therapy.
The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy, eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well-being.
Most public-health measures were handled at the local level. 

New Environmentalism probably started in 1962 with the publication of Rachel Carson's book "Silent Spring." Shortly thereafter, hysterical articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened, uninhabitable planet possibly by the turn of the century.
These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such stalwarts as Paul Ehrlich, Barry Commoner, Rene Dubois and George Wald.
Writing in the 1960s Ms. Carson suggested that the human race could be eliminated in 20 years, and Mr. Wald suggested that life on earth might end by 1985.
Mr. Ehrlich predicted unprecedented famine by 1980.
There were many more.
Thousands of chemical products were categorized as carcinogenic, with recommendations that they be banned from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed rats.
Unknown before 1960 were the inconclusive effects of acid rain, greenhouse warming and ozone depletion, all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense. 

Meanwhile, the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists.
Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution.
But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation (which, they claim, depletes natural resources) and nuclear power (even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect).
They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering. 

New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power.
Let's rationalize our priorities by solving pollution problems at the local level as heretofore.

Your story missed some essential points of the conference on "The Global Environment: Are We Overreacting?" 

First and foremost, the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment.
Consider, for example, the greenhouse effect and climate change; numerous blue-ribbon scientific committees, including one from the National Academy of Science, judge there is a greater than 50% probability of a grave problem in the offing. 

The point was to answer the question in the conference title, not to try to create news stories for the event itself.
Nor was it intended to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions, although various points were raised.
Each speaker was asked to address a specific topic, not deliver a point of view.
Each scientist independently concluded society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change.
This leads to a very special sense of urgency.
If the media decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues, that hardly can be termed non-objective journalism. 

The environment can no longer be a normal issue, to be dealt with on a business-as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change.
We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet's atmosphere.
This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems.
The problems of the environment are so interrelated, so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years.
The consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes.
No, we are not overreacting.

The Consumer News and Business Channel cable network and U.S. News & World Report have formed a joint venture to produce cable program versions of special issues of the magazine. 

The programs will run on the cable network the Sunday evening immediately prior to the release of the special issue of U.S. News & World Report.
CNBC is a joint venture of the National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., and Cablevision System Corp. 

Advertisers will be offered an advertising package, which for a single price, will include time on the CNBC program and ad pages in the special guides. 

CNBC will produce six, one-hour programs, beginning in April 1990.
The first program scheduled in the joint venture is "The 1990 Homeowner's Guide." Other programs and special issues will be based on themes of health, jobs, personal finance, the best colleges, and investments.
The programs will be written and produced by CNBC, with background and research provided by staff from U.S. News & World Report. 

SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON Inc. Thomas E. Meador, 42 years old, was named president and chief operating officer of Balcor Co., a Skokie, Ill., subsidiary of this New York investment banking firm.
Balcor, which has interests in real estate, said the position is newly created.
Mr. Meador had been executive vice president of Balcor.
In addition to his previous real-estate investment and asset-management duties, Mr. Meador takes responsibility for development and property management.
Those duties had been held by Van Pell, 44, who resigned as an executive vice president.
Shearson is about 60%-held by American Express Co. 

When the Soviets announced their last soldier had left Afghanistan in February, the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria.
It was "the Soviets' Vietnam." The Kabul regime would fall.
Millions of refugees would rush home.
A resistance government would walk into Kabul.
Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered.
Eight months after Gen. Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R., a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul, the refugees sit in their camps, and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever. 

But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily.
Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary -- and did.
The U.S. said it would fully support the resistance -- and didn't. 

With the February 1987 U.N. accords "relating to Afghanistan," the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control.
The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid.
The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did.
But as soon as the accords were signed, American officials sharply reduced aid.
In February 1989, when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout, the U.S. cut it further. 

Not so the Soviets.
Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime.
Since the troop withdrawal, Moscow has poured in an additional $200 to $300 million worth per month -- nearly $2 billion since February, equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years.
This includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called "new peaceful long-range weapons," including more than 800 SCUD missiles.
By early May, Moscow had delivered, for example, 1,000 trucks, about 100 tanks, artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles.
Later that month, it added an entire tank brigade, including 120 T-72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles.
By September, a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles, 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar.
In the last few weeks, Moscow has added FROG-7B missiles, the bomber version of the An-12, MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft, MiG-29s, which can outfly Pakistan's U.S.-built F16s, and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter-bombers, which can outfly the MiG-29s. 

Moscow claims this is all needed to protect the Kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance.
It is well-known that the regular Afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts.
But this is not the entire Afghan army, and it is no longer Kabul's only military force.
Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U.S.S.R. and other East bloc nations; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned. 

In addition, the regime has established well-paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000, including 35,000 Soviet-trained troops of the Interior Ministry (KHAD/WAD), which still is directed by 1,500 Soviet KGB officers.
Even if not all these forces are committed to the regime, they are now dependent on it.
And thousands of Afghan children have been taken to the Soviet Union, where they are hostage for the behavior of their families. 

Since 1981, Indian military advisers have been assisting the Kabul regime.
In preparation for the withdrawal, Moscow, Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel.
Cuban military personnel also have been active in Afghanistan since 1979.
The Soviets cut a deal with Iran: a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy.
The deal was symbolized by the restoration of the Shi'ite Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry. 

Moreover, serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces.
Before his assassination in 1988, President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn.
Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.) reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards, ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms. 

Meanwhile, the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics.
In this they are aided by years of American, European, Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public.
This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better, moderate leaders. 

In autumn last year, for example, the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates.
At the last minute, however, Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar, perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists, with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces.
The deal fell through, and Kandahar remains a major regime base. 

The resistance lacks not only air power, armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps, mine detectors, or even winter gloves.
Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime.
Instead, they were pressured by Pakistan's ISI, the channel for their support, into attacking Jalalabad.
They took more than 25% casualties; journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors.
The wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the Kabul regime, but that it continues to exist and fight at all. 

Last summer, in response to congressional criticism, the State Department and the CIA said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off; but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive.
For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack.
Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons.
Indeed, U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year.
Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful. 

For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent, based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf.
No settlement negotiated by others can force the Afghan people to give up their struggle.
A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain.
Creation of a new, realistic U.S. policy is long overdue.

The Internal Revenue Service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation. 

In addition, the tax-collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high-level positions to guide the 120,000-employee agency: a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system, which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world. 

The IRS also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer, who will be hired from within the agency. 

IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring "accountability" to the agency, which has an annual budget of more than $5 billion and collects about $1 trillion a year. 

"My assessment and everyone's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget," Mr. Goldberg said. "And we don't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend $5 billion properly." 

Mr. Goldberg, who took over as head of the IRS in July, has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency, waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency. 

The IRS operates on a computer system designed in 1961, which it has been trying to modernize for years.
And the agency, which operated throughout fiscal 1989 with a $360 million budget shortfall, has been under a hiring freeze since last fall. 

The new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue. 

"I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which, in turn, I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue," he said. 

The IRS hopes to fill the new positions soon.
Customarily, it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency, but Mr. Goldberg said he plans to "scour the world" for the chief information officer and the comptroller. 

Although the jobs will probably pay between $70,000 and $80,000 a year, IRS officials are confident that they can attract top-notch candidates from the private sector. 

"You're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever," Mr. Goldberg said. "On the comptroller side, you're developing and making work financial controls governing a $6 billion budget." 

President Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest, the White House said. 

Mr. Bush had threatened a veto previously.
But he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president. 

White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said negotiations between Bush aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success.
Most lawmakers think it will be extremely difficult for Mr. Bush's opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed to override the veto.
But there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that holds up the $156.7 billion funding bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. 

Mr. Bush has said he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother.
But he has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who say they are victims of rape and incest, arguing that those exceptions are enforced so loosely that they open the way for abortions for other women. 

Paul Tanner was named president, chief executive officer and chairman of this oil and natural gas company.
He succeeds John A. Boudreau, who resigned for personal reasons.
Mr. Tanner had been president of Penn Pacific's National Southwest Capital Group subsidiary.
Mr. Boudreau will remain with Penn Pacific as a director and a member of the executive committee.
He has also agreed to become president of a new subsidiary to be formed to make future acquisitions, the company said. 

Spooked investors, despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks, should hold on tight to their Jaguar shares. 

That's the view of some analysts here who argue that Britain's leading maker of luxury cars still may have two U.S. auto giants battling for it. 

Yesterday, Ford Motor disclosed that it has raised its holding in Jaguar to 10.4% from 5%.
Both Ford and its rival General Motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company. 

Ford's latest move increases the pressure on GM to complete its current talks with Jaguar quickly.
GM is likely to reach the cooperative operating pact it has been seeking in about two weeks, knowledgeable individuals say. 

At that point investors may face a long, bumpy ride.
A victor in the fight for Jaguar may not emerge until after the expiration late next year of British government takeover restrictions.
The curbs prevent a buyer from purchasing more than 15% of Jaguar shares without permission. "This is an exceptionally odd takeover battle," says London analyst Christopher Will of Shearson Lehman Hutton. 

Jaguar's American depositary receipts were up 3/8 yesterday in a down market, closing at 10 3/8. (Jaguar's ADRs make the company one of the most widely held United Kingdom stocks in the U.S., with more than one-fourth of its shares owned there.) 

Jaguar topped the most-active list for the U.S. over-the-counter market Monday.
And on London's Stock Exchange Monday, 18.5 million shares were traded, far above the usual volume.
Ford's share purchases undoubtedly accounted for much of Monday's heavy trading. 

Last week, many Jaguar shareholders took their money and ran.
Fears that Ford's ardor might be cooling put Jaguar shares into reverse after GM confirmed its friendly negotiations with Jaguar.
But yesterday's announcement indicates that Ford hasn't lost interest. 

Both Shearson's Mr. Will and Stephen Reitman, European auto analyst at the London brokerage firm UBS-Phillips & Drew, recently switched their Jaguar recommendations to hold from buy. "Sit tight" through the coming volatility, Mr. Reitman suggests, though he concedes that many small investors will find Jaguar's zigzags "too hard to swallow." 

But a crucial point is how Ford reacts when GM, the world's largest auto maker, firms up its proposed deal with Jaguar.
At the moment, Ford executives will say little beyond reiterating their desire to raise Ford's Jaguar stake to about 15%. 

GM is expected to inject roughly #200 million ($316 million) by acquiring some Jaguar shares, and then win Jaguar management's promise of an eventual 30% stake.
Analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models, doubling Jaguar's yearly output of 50,000 cars. 

Jaguar shareholders would have to bless such a far-reaching accord.
Ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the U.K. government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early. "I think Ford is going to come out with full guns blazing," Mr. Reitman says. "Ford wants {Jaguar} very much." U.S. takeover-stock speculators, who may own between 20% and 30% of Jaguar, could give Ford enough votes to block the GM deal. 

GM might counterbid.
Then, Mr. Will says, "you get a bidding war between two very rich, very determined international companies." He believes Jaguar's share price could zoom to between #8 and #10 ($12.60 to $15.80). 

"There's quite a bit of value left in the {Jaguar} shares here even though they have run up" lately, says Doug Johnson, a fund manager for Seattle-based Safeco Asset Management.
At the moment, he intends to keep the firm's 180,000 Jaguar shares. 

The risk is that Jaguar's share price could slump if GM's agreement with Jaguar effectively locks out its U.S. rival. "Ford's appetite to attack {Jaguar} could gradually wane over time, particularly if Saab is a reasonably attractive proposition," says John Lawson, an auto analyst at London's Nomura Research Institute.
He thinks Saab-Scania AB on Friday will announce the sale of 50% of its car division to Ford; the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months. 

Clifford Stahl, president and chief investment officer of C-S Capital Advisors Inc., two weeks ago sold his Cincinnati firm's 107,100 Jaguar ADRs at about 10 each, making a tidy profit on a holding purchased at 4 7/8 in early May. "I thought the probabilities of {a bidding war} happening were less," he says.
Of course, that was before Ford's latest move.

Deeply ingrained in both the book review "Kissing Nature Good-bye" by Stephen MacDonald (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 27) and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity.
Is such a view justified?
In the absence of humans, would the Earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term? 

Clearly not.
About 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended.
Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America, northern Europe and Asia.
This global warming must have been entirely natural -- nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter-gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves.
Furthermore, no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming.
It is probably continuing and may well account for most of, or all of, present-day global warming. 

I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage, but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist-exploiters-greedy-American-consumers-global- warming scenario as the sole model for discussion.

Matra S.A. reported its 1989 first-half profit soared 88%, and indicated that its previous estimate of a 50% rise in earnings for all of 1989 will be exceeded by a wide margin. 

The French electronics and defense group said attributable consolidated net profit for the first six months of 1989 totaled 244 million francs ($38.4 million), compared with 130 million francs ($20.5 million) in the corresponding period of 

Operating profit climbed 51%, to 572 million francs from 378 million in the first half of 1988. 

Matra said the sharp improvement in net profit partly reflected a decline of 59 million francs in the group's net loss from nonrecurring items in the first half of this year to 104 million francs from 163 million a year earlier.
There was also a decline in the group's net financial costs to 25 million francs from 50 million a year before. 

These movements were offset, however, by a steep rise in corporate income tax payments to 199 million francs from 35 million in the first six months of 1988. 

Matra said the sharp rise in its first-half earnings was based on a 15% gain in consolidated revenue to 10.16 billion francs from 8.85 billion a year earlier. 

Why is the stock market suddenly so volatile? 

Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a now familiar dance: It plunged 60.25 points before lunch, with most of the drop occurring in 25 minutes.
Then, it rebounded to finish down only 18.65 points.
And those swings paled beside Friday's 190.58-point plunge and Monday's 88.12-point recovery. 

"It's madness -- that in an hour you can whack off so much value," says Stanford Calderwood, chairman of Trinity Investment Management Corp., Boston. 

And, apparently, it is here to stay.
Richard Bernstein, senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co, says, "My gut feel is that we'll live with those swings for a while." 

There are many reasons for the market's jumpiness: new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options; computer-driven strategies like program trading; and crowd psychology.
But most are linked by a single theme: liquidity -- the ability to get in and out of the market quickly. 

Prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways to turn over shares at ever-faster rates and increasingly acting in concert. 

"Institutions are herding animals," says Peter Anderson, who heads the pension-fund management arm of IDS Financial Services Inc. "We watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators.
Like lemmings, we tend to move in the same direction at same time." And that, naturally, exacerbates price movements. 

Institutions -- who now account for most trading -- count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye-blink.
But when they discover that markets aren't always as liquid as they supposed -- markets jump. 

On Monday, for instance, Howard Ward, a principal at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, found that "you couldn't buy blue-chips at quoted prices without paying up." And when many firms had to "pay up," Monday's sudden rally was sparked. 

Trading in futures and options, some people believe, can add to volatility.
Investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks; that is, a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks. 

These and other modern trading methods "tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets," says George Douglas, first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "It's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy" -- so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market. 

One new investment style called "asset allocation" shifts portfolio weightings between stocks, bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive. 

For instance, First Quadrant Corp., an asset allocator based in Morristown, N.J., said it quickly boosted stock positions in its "aggressive" accounts to 75% from 55% to take advantage of plunging prices Friday.
It added another 5% Monday before stocks rallied.
When they did, the firm reduced those stock holdings to about 70%. 

A classic example of institutions' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance, now widely discredited.
Before the 1987 crash, an estimated $60 billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique.
The idea was to "insure" the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped -- eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves.
But in October 1987, when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time, they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets. 

Yet even today, institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets.
Others are doing "index arbitrage"a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures. 

Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies, all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch.
But institutions say Wall Street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets. 

Brokers don't deny that.
Wall Street traders say that, with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s, securities firms can't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock. "I think everyone's a little more leery," says Jack Baker, head of equity trading at Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc. "The institutions have driven (commission) rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital," says Tom Gallagher, senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at Oppenheimer & Co. "Why should I risk money for a guy for who's paying me five cents a dance?
All you get is risk." 

Lack of liquidity can also result from exchange "reforms." Many traders say that "circuit breakers" put in place to damp volatility after the 1987 crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged Friday.
The circuit breakers caused a 30-minute shutdown in trading in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling. 

"With the futures-trading halt, you could only sell stocks" to cut exposure to the market, says a money manager. "It was scary to people thinking that they couldn't get their trades off." 

"It was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you there were three doors to exit," said one Chicago-based futures trader. "Then they said, `By the way, two of the doors are locked. '" 

The takeover mania also adds to volatility.
UAL Corp. is a good example.
Valued as a buy-out target, the airline stock was trading at nearly $280 a share.
When the deal ran into trouble, the stock tumbled; it closed at $198 yesterday.
Presumably, UAL is now trading closer to its value based on earnings. 

By contrast, traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves.
Scott Black, a value-oriented money manager who heads Delphi Management Inc., points out that for those who invest on fundamentals, "the value of a stock from day to day doesn't change all that much." 

Some experts say markets aren't as volatile as widely assumed.
Hans Stoll, finance professor at Vanderbilt University, says the current volatility in U.S. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s, decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced. "I just can't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility," he says. 

And Robert D. Arnott, president of asset allocator First Quadrant, notes that before Friday's tailspin, daily volatility on the New York Stock Exchange in recent weeks had reached "historically low levels." 

Some people tend to ignore that a 50-point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower.
John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the Big Board, asserts that "1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years." 

But the low average volatility Mr. Phelan is talking about isn't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week.
In addition, Sanford Grossman, a Wharton School finance professor, says volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions "who can go out and say `I have a billion dollars of stocks to sell. '" 

Some people think the search for liquidity is fruitless.
In 1936, John Maynard Keynes wrote that "of the maxims of orthodox finance none, surely, is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity." It leads investors to focus on short-term price movements -- "a game of musical chairs," he called it -- rather than on long-term fundamental valuation.

Weyerhaeuser Co. reported a one-time gain and strong wood-product sales that offset weakness in pulp and paper to fuel a 15% jump in third-quarter net income to $166.8 million, or 78 cents a share. 

In the 1988 third quarter, the forest-products company reported profit of $144.9 million, or 69 cents a share. 

Sales rose 9% to $2.57 billion from $2.36 billion. 

For the nine months, the company posted a 14% rise in profit to $469.8 million, or $2.21 a share, from $410.3 million, or $1.95 a share.
Sales rose 9% to $7.54 billion from $6.95 billion. 

Results for the 1989 third quarter and nine months include a pretax loss of $33 million from the company's business improvement and refocusing program, and a gain of $49 million on the sale of a subsidiary's common stock. 

Forest-products operations strengthened in the third quarter, while paper operations were dogged by higher costs, soft newsprint exports and a strong Japanese yen.
Some competing forest-products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business.
Weyerhaeuser's pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months, but full-year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs, plus pricing of certain products, the company said. 

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company said export log and lumber markets will be weak, while panel and plywood markets will be stronger.
Pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price variables, the company said. 

This is written to correct a misquotation in your Oct. 3 article "Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced by Using Two Drugs." In this article, I was alleged to have said, "Any patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he's not getting this therapy." 

I didn't say this, and I'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote.
I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs, levamisole and 5-fluorouracil, to any of my colon-cancer patients.
With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer.
This is not nearly good enough.
I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients, both today and tomorrow, should offer the hope of something better than that.
My statement, read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference, was the following: "New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results.
These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better.
I feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity." 

We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead.
This hope, however, will never be realized if we use levamisole and 5-fluorouracil as a stopping point.

HUGO'S BLAST generates pleas for aid from South Carolina small businesses. 

The Small Business Administration has received more than 5,000 formal requests for disaster loans because of the hurricane.
About 45% of requests for SBA relief loans, which also are available to homeowners, come from small businesses, compared with a 25% business share after most disasters.
The SBA expects to make about $1 billion in Hurricane Hugo loans.
The disaster fund is replenished by loan repayments. 

Hardest hit by Hugo in South Carolina were small retailers tied to the tourist industry and businesses in agriculture and cultivated seafood.
The State Development Board set up a Hugo Hotline to accept business-to-business help.
After NBC weather man Willard Scott broadcast the hot-line number, it was flooded with 10,000 calls.
Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce began using its national TV show to seek help, such as equipment, for business owners. 

Local bankers and accountants help applicants fill out forms. "It helps us, and people feel better talking to someone who's gone through the same thing," an SBA official says. 

HEALTH BENEFITS remain a central lobbying effort, even as Section 89 fades. 

The Senate, after deleting Section 89 repeal from its deficit-reduction bill, still is expected to join the House in voting to kill the law, which forces companies to provide comparable benefits to laborers and executives alike.
In lobbying on other health-coverage topics, the National Federation of Independent Business will press for legislation that would give self-employed people a 100% tax deduction for their own health plans, up from 25% currently.
And the group will urge that the federal government pre-empt state rules on what must be covered by employers' health insurance. 

Small-business groups also will fight the medical-leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves.
And they still oppose as too costly an employer-paid health insurance bill sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually.
There is also worry that the Pepper Commission studying long-term health care will again push lawmakers toward employerpaid solutions.
The Section 89 victory could have a downside by making it harder to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals. 

"With the repeal of Section 89, we can no longer say they're discouraging businesses from offering health plans," says Christine Russell, the Chamber of Commerce's small-business advocate. 

JUMPING THE GUN: Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) was outraged after a private word to John Motley, lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, resulted in a news release saying that the Senate Finance Committee chairman would recommend repeal of Section 89.
Even though the announcement was true in the end, it was issued without the senator's permission. "I blew it," Mr. Motley says apologetically. "It was a timing mistake." 

PRISON-SHOP BLUES: Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.) protests pending legislation to end the preference that the federal prison system gets in selling prisoner-made furniture and other goods to government agencies.
Small-business suppliers want prisons to stop getting high priority, especially as prison production grows with swelling inmate populations.
Last year, the prisons' sales to the Pentagon totaled $336 million. 

REPAIR SHOPS SCRAP for more access to work on auto-emissions systems. 

Groups representing some independent auto-repair shops join a compromise on the Clean Air legislation worked out between environmentalists and Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.).
The plan would increase the warranty on auto-emission systems to eight years or 80,000 miles from five years or 50,000 for major parts.
But the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to two years or 24,000 miles.
The garage owners say they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after two years. 

The repair shops aren't united, however.
Shops represented by the Automotive Service Industry Association and the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association oppose any increase in warranty length.
They say the longer the warranty, the longer customers will automatically return to new-car dealers, which then find non-warranty work that might otherwise go to repair shops.
The House Energy Committee will debate the issue later this month. 

Stan Hathcock, an Atlanta garage owner who opposes a longer warranty, estimates that the current plan costs him as much as $15,000 a year in lost business. 

SMALL TALK: Some 70% of graduates who recently earned an M.B.A. degree say they'd prefer to work in or own a small company, yet most take jobs with large concerns, says a survey by the Foster McKay Group, a New York recruiting firm. . . . Cardinal Scientific Inc. of Waldorf, Md., seeks a Small Business Innovation Research grant to produce a "nozzle assembly for an Army mass delousing outfit." 

Investor Asher Edelman increased his stake in Intelogic Trace Inc. and cleared the way for additional purchases. 

It wasn't clear, however, whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corp., a San Antonio, Texas-based data-processing systems maker. 

Intelogic Trace, a computer services company, was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985, after Mr. Edelman gained control.
After Mr. Ackerman announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from Mr. Edelman, the corporate raider purchased 30% of Datapoint's shares. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Edelman said from Sept. 29 to Oct. 13, he acquired 309,500 shares of Intelogic common shares for $2.25 to $2.375 each.
The purchases increased his stake to 16.2% of the shares outstanding. 

The filing also said certain provisions which apply to persons acquiring 20% or more of Intelogic common stock, were waived by Intelogic for Mr. Edelman, who is chairman of the company.
Mr. Edelman couldn't be reached for comment. 

Markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge.
Gold, which hasn't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time, yesterday achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness: The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market. 

The settlement prices of the December, February and April gold contracts were even with Monday's final prices.
The December 1989 contract, which has the greatest trading volume, ended at $371.20 an ounce.
The other months posted advances of 10 cents to 20 cents an ounce. 

According to one analyst, Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber, New York, the stock market's ability on Monday to rally from last Friday's decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy wasn't going to fall either -- took the starch out of precious metals prices, and out of gold's, in particular. 

Yesterday, gold traded within a narrow range.
Gold tried to rally on Monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year: selling by gold producers, who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold. 

"December delivery gold is trading in a range of $365 to $375 {an ounce} and is having difficulty breaking out above that," Mr. Savaiko said. "Producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold." 

Also, Mr. Savaiko noted, stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because "we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that doesn't make gold and precious metals attractive." 

Jeffrey Nichols, president of APMS Canada, Toronto precious metals advisers, said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal. "Investors in the U.S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the {Federal Reserve} in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system, which helped the stock market rebound on Monday," he said. 

There isn't any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold, he said. "They still bear the memory of October 1987, when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell," Mr. Nichols said. "It's an experience they don't want to repeat." 

At the moment gold traders aren't concerned about inflation, he said, and as for the dollar, "gold's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency aren't having much impact on gold." 

Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank, said: "There is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its `flight to safety' quality.
There is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher, it may be just a false alarm.
This is keeping the gold traders handcuffed." 

The most remarkable feature about yesterday's action was that the price of roughly $370 an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold, Mr. Mehta said. 

"I don't know what it means over the long run, but for the short term, it appears that gold producers are grateful for the $10 or so that gold has risen over the past week or so," he said. 

Previously, he noted, gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market, letting prices rise as much as possible before selling. 

Mr. Mehta observed that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, which rose sharply in August, according to yesterday's report, has been having less and less impact on the gold market. "The dollar hasn't reacted much to it, so gold hasn't either," he said. 

In other commodity markets yesterday: 

ENERGY: Crude oil prices rose slightly in lackluster activity as traders in the pits tried to assess action in the stock market.
Since stock market indexes plummeted last Friday, participants in all markets have been wary.
When traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized, oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration.
Crude oil for November delivery edged up by 16 cents a barrel to $20.75 a barrel.
Heating oil prices also rose.
November gasoline slipped slightly. 

SUGAR: Futures prices rose on a report that Cuba may seek to postpone some sugar shipments.
The March contract advanced 0.14 cent a pound to 14.11 cents.
According to an analyst, Cuba can't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked Japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year, into early next year. "Japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar," the analyst said.
It was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices, the analyst said.
Another analyst noted that Cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years. "To the professionals in the trade it didn't cause much surprise.
The March futures contract traded as high as 14.24 cents, but couldn't sustain the advance," he said. 

LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: The prices of cattle, hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending, which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork.
The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply Monday.
Cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef. 

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The prices of most soybean and soybean-meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying from the U.S. or South America about 250,000 metric tons of soybeans and as many as 400,000 metric tons of soybean meal.
Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible U.S. soybean sales because U.S. exports are lagging.
Since Sept. 1, about 13 million fewer bushels of U.S. soybeans have been sold overseas than for the same period last year.
Corn futures prices rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed. 

Sandoz AG, a major Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, said that its group sales rose 25% to 9.482 billion francs ($5.80 billion) in the first nine months of this year, with strong gains in all divisions. 

A year earlier sales totaled 7.567 billion francs. 

Positive currency rates and strong sales growth led to a substantial rise in consolidated profit in the period, although the company didn't provide figures, as is customary with Swiss companies. 

Sandoz said it expects a "substantial increase" in consolidated profit for the full year, barring major currency rate changes. 

The Treasury plans to raise $1.55 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem $14.1 billion in maturing bills. 

The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Jan. 25, 1990, and April 26, 1990, respectively. 

Tenders for the bills, available in minimum $10,000 denominations, must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches. 

Rohm & Haas Co. said third-quarter net income skidded 35% to $32.6 million, or 49 cents a share. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the chemicals company had net of $49.8 million, or 75 cents a share. 

Sales were $623 million, up 0.5% from $619.8 million a year ago. 

Rohm & Haas, which plans to start operating seven new production units this year, attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense.
The company also cited the stronger dollar, which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars. 

In addition, the company said, it was hurt by higher than previous-year costs for raw materials, though those costs have declined since the second quarter.
Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs, such as overtime pay. 

For the nine months, Rohm & Haas net totaled $155 million, or $2.33 a share, down 17% from $187.8 million, or $2.82 a share, a year ago.
Sales rose 5.2% to $2.04 billion from $1.94 billion the previous year. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Rohm & Haas closed at $33 a share, down $1.75. 

Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling Congress (I) Party control of the government. 

Other analysts say the Indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties. 

Elections in this large, diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict.
Much depends on the opposition, a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former Gandhi cabinet minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh. 

The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. Gandhi and his five years in power -- five years of ups and downs, promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity. 

Yesterday, four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party, Mr. Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on Nov. 22 and 24.
The elections will be held in different states on one of the two days. (The lower house's five-year term expires in January; the Parliament's upper house is appointed.) 

The elections will be a rigorous test for the 45-year-old prime minister and Congress (I), which in various forms has ruled for 40 of India's 42 years of independence.
After a landslide win in 1984 in polls held after the assassination of his mother, Indira Gandhi, Mr. Gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride. 

His early promises to make India a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy.
His pledge to clean up local administration and Indian politics, including his own party, went unfulfilled.
His "Mr.
Clean" image was muddied by an arms-kickback scandal, which will be a major campaign issue.
Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. Gandhi's spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local government will crest at the polls. "There's a wide feeling of indignation across the country," says Bhabani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy Research, in New Delhi. "I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman, by a corrupt revenue collector.
This could be a big protest against an administrative failure." 

Even if the Congress (I) retains control of the government, Mr. Gandhi's ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority.
Economic analysts call his trail-blazing liberalization of the Indian economy incomplete, and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power. 

The Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament, has 542 elected and two appointed seats.
In 1984, the Congress (I) captured 405 seats, the largest victory in the history of Indian democracy.
The landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in India at the time.
Mrs. Gandhi had been assassinated by separatist Sikhs, and many Indians feared their country might split apart.
In the previous three general elections, similar national issues clinched the vote.
In 1971, the Congress Party won after India's victory in the Bangladesh war.
In 1977, Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule, and in 1980, after her successors made a mess of their three years in power, she was restored to office. 

Most political analysts say that if Mr. Gandhi's opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts, the Congress (I) will lose big.
But if the opposition remains fractured, the Congress (I) could win a small majority, or lead a coalition government.
Chimanbhai Mehta, a parliamentarian and former Gandhi ally, predicts Congress (I) will win only 150 seats, a quarter of the house, if the opposition fields single candidates in 80% of the races.
Analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite, and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates. 

The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign, but it's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters.
In 1986, India signed a $1.4 billion contract with AB Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB, to purchase 400 artillery pieces.
The contract was negotiated by the countries' two prime ministers, and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents' costs. 

In April 1987, evidence surfaced that commissions were paid.
The opposition charged that the money was used to bribe Indian government officials, an allegation denied by Mr. Gandhi's administration.
But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence.
The scandal has faded and flared, but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages, and that has helped galvanize the opposition, which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills.
It was the first time in 20 years that such government bills were defeated. 

In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone, a job, and even into a school, the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government.
That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi, whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power.
His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics, in the economy or on the military front, and has chalked up some successes.
But the average Indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt.
His failures in those two areas deeply, and sometimes bitterly, disappointed many Indians. 

"We don't like the Congress (I)," says Sooraji Jath, a farmer in the western state of Gujarat. "The Congress government is taking the farmers' bread and not giving us any support.
When there are well problems, light problems, road problems, the government tells us to forget it." 

The greatest thing going for Mr. Gandhi and the Congress (I) Party is the poor reputation of the opposition.
Even if it unites for the elections, its coherence is likely to be temporary.
When the Congress (I) lost the 1977 election, following Mrs. Gandhi's hated emergency rule, a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated.
Many Indians fear a repeat of that experience. 

March 24, 1986: AB Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB, enters into a $1.4 billion contract with India's Defense Ministry to supply 400 Bofors FH-77B 155-mm field howitzer guns.
In 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, in his talks with then Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen. 

April 16, 1987: Swedish National Radio reports that about $40 million -- nearly 3% of the total contract -- was paid by Bofors as commissions to middlemen. 

June 1, 1987: Sweden's National Audit Bureau releases its report confirming payment of about $40 million to unidentified Indians.
The report says that investigations were severely hampered by lack of cooperation from Bofors.
Bofors says it can't disclose the names of the middlemen because it would jeopardize industrial confidentiality.
A portion of the report containing names of the middlemen is withheld by officials citing bank secrecy requirements. 

Aug. 6, 1987: Prime Minister Gandhi tells the Indian Parliament, ". . . neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions.
That is the truth." 

Aug. 26, 1987: Bofors admits payments of $41 million to middlemen. 

April 22, 1988: The Hindu newspaper publishes facsimiles of bank documents for foreign-exchange remittances and letters between Bofors and certain private companies related to the sale of the guns to India. 

April 26, 1988: A parliamentary investigative committee dominated by the Congress (I) Party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any Indian individual or company. 

July 18, 1989: The comptroller and auditor-general of India reports serious lapses in the government's technical and financial evaluation of the Bofors deal. 

Sept. 15, 1989: Retired army Chief of Staff Krishnaswami Sundarji discloses in an interview that he suggested in May 1987 that the government cancel the Bofors contract.
According to Gen. Sundarji, that would have forced Bofors to disclose the names of the middlemen who received kickbacks from the company.
His recommendation was rejected by the government. 

Oct. 9. 1989: The Hindu newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the Swedish National Audit Bureau's report.
The disclosures state that commissions were paid by Bofors to an Indian agent of the arms company. 

Hachette S.A., a European media and publishing group, reported a small rise in its attributable first-half group profit, excluding exceptional items, to 133.8 million francs ($21.1 million) from 130.1 million francs a year earlier. 

The Paris-based group said its earlier projection -- that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 -- remains valid. 

Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses, Hachette's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs, practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs. 

Analysts said Hachette's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a capital gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49% owned by Hachette. 

An unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap for August dragged the dollar lower Tuesday, but profit-taking on short positions helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts. 

While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street's gyrations, it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above the day's lows. 

Soon after the release of the U.S. trade figures, the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 140.95 yen.
It also declined against the mark but didn't reach its intraday low of 1.8435 marks until two hours later. 

The unit stabilized about midday New York time at around 1.85 marks and 141 yen, prompting unconfirmed rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve had intervened to blunt the unit's tumble.
The dollar finished at its intraday highs. 

Dealers noted that the foreign exchange market's initial bearish reaction to the U.S. trade figures was tempered later by a "calmer reassessment of the data." 

The U.S. Commerce Department reported a $10.77 billion deficit in August, compared with a revised July deficit of $8.24 billion.
Economists had expected a $9.1 billion gap. 

The August figure reflected a 6.4% rise in imports and a 0.2% drop in exports. 

Marc M. Goloven, an economist with Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York, said that while the figures appear to indicate a sadly deteriorating U.S. trade performance, there's still enough positive news in the data to justify buying dollars. 

He said that while the U.S. trade gap with Canada has widened significantly, the trade deficit with Western Europe and Japan continues to narrow.
And he added that manufactured goods exports are still rising. 

The dollar's near-term path remains foggy, according to currencny analysts, who characterize the market as "bewildering." In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8667 marks, down from 1.8685 marks late Monday, and at 142.75 yen, up from 141.85 yen late Monday.
Sterling was unchanged at $1.5753. 

In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.55 yen, unchanged from Tuesday's Tokyo close.
Later, the U.S. currency fell to about 142.25 yen on news reports of the San Francisco earthquake. 

Some analysts remain bullish and point out that the dollar continues to be well bid despite key rate increases in Europe and Japan, several weeks of aggressive dollar sales by the world central banks -- some traders estimate that the barrage of sales topped $12 billion -- and a 190-point plunge on the New York Stock Exchange. 

They note that the U.S. unit is trading at the upper end of the presumed target zones established by the Group of Seven trading partners.
The G-7 comprises West Germany, the U.S., France, the U.K., Italy, Canada and Japan. 

The so-called Louvre accord was seen to have set ranges of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks and 120 yen to 140 yen. 

They say that the recent injection of liquidity into the U.S. banking system has been modest, and they don't anticipate significant easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve. 

The Fed arranged $1.5 billion of customer repurchase agreements Tuesday, the second repurchase agreement in two days. 

The move, which injects capital into the system, is seen as an effort to reassure the finanicial markets that the U.S. central bank is ready to provide the ample liquidity. 

But other analysts contend that while the Fed's move to loosen credit hasn't been aggressive, it nevertheless sends a clear signal that, at least for now, the Fed has relaxed its grip on credit. 

They add that the Fed has allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5/8% from its levels of just below 9% last week.
The federal funds rate is the overnight lending rate that banks charge each other. 

Market participants said that the mark continues to post the most significant gains against the dollar. 

On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367.40 an ounce, up 10 cents.

The oil and auto industries, united in their dislike of President Bush's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels, announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner-burning gasoline. 

Officials of the Big Three auto makers and 14 petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most cost-effective fuel for reducing cities' air-pollution problems, with no bias toward any fuel in particular. 

However, their search notably won't include natural gas or pure methanol -- the two front-running alternative fuels -- in tests to be completed by next summer.
Instead, the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline, which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas. 

Environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public-relations attempt to head off a White House proposal to require a million cars a year that run on cleaner-burning fuels by 1997. 

While major oil companies have been experimenting with cleaner-burning gasoline blends for years, only Atlantic Richfield Co. is now marketing a lower-emission gasoline for older cars currently running on leaded fuel.
The initial $11 million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines, said Joe Colucci, head of fuels and lubricants at General Motors Corp. research laboratories.
It will compare 21 different blends of gasolines with three mixtures of up to 85% methanol. 

A second phase of research, which is still being planned, will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars.
There was no cost estimate for the second phase. 

"The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers," said Keith McHenry, a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp. "And we are looking for the most cost-effective way to clean up the air." 

But David Hawkins, an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the research appears merely to be a way to promote reformulated gasoline. 

Oil and auto companies supported a move on Capitol Hill last week to gut Mr. Bush's plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative-fueled cars by 1995.
Instead, a House subcommittee adopted a clean-fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative.
The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean-air bill. 

Oncor Inc., Gaithersburg, Md., said it received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market a genetic test that will assist in diagnosis and treatment of leukemia and lymph cancer. 

The B/T gene rearrangement test is more accurate than existing tests for diagnosing the type of cancer, whether it has spread or whether there is a recurrence following treatment, said Oncor President Stephen Turner.
Mr. Turner said the test initially will be used in conjunction with biopsies and other tests, but eventually might become the benchmark for tumor analysis.
Mr. Turner said the test will be shipped in 45 days to hospitals and clinical laboratories. 

Dr. Wyndham Wilson, a cancer treatment specialist at the National Cancer Institute, said the test is widely used in research centers but isn't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in choosing the most effective treatment.
But the test may prove to be more sensitive in determining whether a tumor has spread or returned following treatment, Dr. Wilson said. "We don't know yet how useful it's going to be," he said. 

Oncor, a six-year-old developer of genetic medical tests, projects that the cancer test will help it to post its first-ever profit during the first quarter of 1990, Mr. Turner said.
The company will charge $35 for a test and projects about $2 million in revenue from the test during the first 12 months of marketing, he said. 

MACMILLAN BLOEDEL Ltd. said it borrowed 215 million Dutch guilders (US$102 million) from a group of Dutch institutional investors.
MacMillan Bloedel, a Vancouver, British Columbia, forest products concern, said the 8.1% loan is due Oct. 16, 1996.
Funds will be used to repay existing short-term debt and to finance capital spending, it said. 

UAL'S STOCK SKIDDED an additional $24.875, to $198, as British Airways indicated it may balk at any hastily revised version of the aborted $6.79 billion buy-out of United Air's parent.
UAL has fallen $87.25, or 31%, in the three trading days since disclosure of the buy-out's collapse jolted the stock market.
Meanwhile, investor Marvin Davis said he remains interested in UAL, but he dropped his earlier $300-a-share back-up bid. 

Stock prices fell broadly in heavy trading, dominated by futures-related program selling and further declines by UAL and other airline stocks.

Control Data Corp., Minneapolis, signed a joint development agreement with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to incorporate an emerging computing architecture in future machines. 

MIPS is a leader in what is known as reduced-instruction set computing, or RISC, a technology combining microprocessors and sophisticated software.
In joining MIPS, Control Data follows several competitors in embracing RISC as a new design approach. 

Digital Equipment Corp., Tandem Computers Inc., NEC Corp. and Group Bull, among others, have similar arrangements with MIPs, based in Sunnyvale, Calif. 

Control Data said it expects its first RISC-based mainframe machine to be introduced next year.
The accord with MIPS calls for Control Data to share its expertise in data storage, the companies said. 

Control Data also said it is developing what it called a "supermainframe" computer, the Cyber 2000, intended for scientists, engineers and other users of generalpurpose high-performance computers. 

Newport Electronics Inc. of Santa Ana, Calif., said Milton B. Hollander, who holds a 49.4% stake, requested a special shareholders' meeting next Wednesday to remove four current directors and elect an alternative slate. 

Mr. Hollander's High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford, Conn., acquired most of its stake last August in an $11-a-share tender offer for Newport, a maker of electronic-measuring devices. 

Newport said Mr. Hollander is asking shareholders to retain only one director, James R. Lees, a Newport vice president.
The board isn't proposing a slate of its own and the other four current directors don't want to serve beyond the special meeting date, Newport said. 

Mr. Hollander "is the new owner and wants to exercise control," said Barret B. Weekes, Newport's chairman. 

Robert J. Regal was named president and chief executive officer of this company's Universal-Rundle Corp. unit.
Mr. Regal had been president and chief executive of RBS Industries Inc. Robert H. Carlson, previous president and chief executive of Universal-Rundle, will assume the title of chairman of the unit, a vitreous-china maker. 

Paul Ely, general partner of Alpha Partners, a venture-capital firm based in Menlo Park, Calif., was named a director of this computer company.
Mr. Ely, 57 years old, temporarily increases the board to seven members.
However, director Thomas O'Rourke has said he won't seek re-election at the company's annual meeting next month. 

Bearings Inc. said its chairman, John R. Cunin, will retire as an officer of the company on Jan. 2. 

George L. LaMore, president and chief executive officer, will become chairman and chief executive upon Mr. Cunin's retirement.
John C. Dannemiller, executive vice president and chief operating officer, will become president and chief operating officer. 

Mr. Cunin, 65 years old, was chief executive of the distributor of bearings and power-transmission products from 1982 to 1988.
He will continue as a director. 

Mr. LaMore, 63, a 48-year veteran at Bearings, has been president since 1983.
Mr. Dannemiller, 51, joined Bearings in August 1988 from Leaseway Transportation Corp., where he was president and chief operating officer.
He has been a Bearings director since 1985. 

The appointments are part of a planned succession at the company.

Japanese air-conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd. was fined two million yen ($14,000) for exporting to the Soviet Union a chemical solution that could be used in missile-guidance systems.
A Daikin executive in charge of exports when the high-purity halogenated hydrocarbon was sold to the Soviets in 1986 received a suspended 10-month jail sentence.
Judge Masaaki Yoneyama told the Osaka District Court Daikin's "responsibility is heavy because illegal exports lowered international trust in Japan." Sale of the solution in concentrated form to Communist countries is prohibited by Japanese law and by international agreement. 

A Soviet legislative panel rejected as not radical enough a government proposal on decentralizing economic control.
The newspaper Leninskoye Zamya said the committee decided the plan to parcel out economic powers previously exercised by Moscow to the country's 15 republics "doesn't reflect the radical changes in the Soviet federation." The committee gave the government until Nov. 15 to revise the proposal.
The move reflected the growing confidence of the revamped Supreme Soviet. 

Scott Paper Co. said it is abandoning a proposed $650 million tree-farming project in Indonesia because it no longer expects to use as much eucalyptus pulp as previously anticipated.
The eucalyptus plantation and pulp mill, which would have covered about 175,000 acres in the Irian Jaya region, had been approved by Indonesia's investment board.
But it was opposed by some environmentalists as a threat to Irian Jaya's forests and a potential source of social unrest for the primitive tribes who inhabit them. 

Yaohan Departmentstore Co. of Japan is moving its international-operations headquarters and holding company to Hong Kong to gain from the British colony's economic advantages and tax structure.
With funds of 5.56 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$712 million), the new company, Yaohan International Co., plans to acquire 10 of Hong Kong's top restaurants.
It also intends to set up an international wholesale market with the Singapore government next May and to open a department store in Bangkok and shopping centers in Malaysia, Taiwan, Canada, Chicago and Seattle by December 1990.
The chain currently has 90 retail outlets in Japan, seven in the U.S., three in Hong Kong and a dozen more scattered around the globe. 

Major European auction houses are turning increasingly to specialized sales. 

Christie's will soon have a sale of Dada and Symbolist art while Sotheby's is luring collectors with sales of Swiss, German, Spanish, Australian and Canadian paintings.
In Brussels, Hotel de Ventes Horta auctioned pistols and sabers-along with paintings and jewels. 

Berlin's Villa Grisebach will auction art works with pre-sale estimates of less than $1,600 on Nov. 25.
The auction house, known for its sales of top-drawer 19th and 20th century works, is providing "a service to clients who don't want to sell just their fabulous oil paintings," says Villa Grisebach's Vivien Reuter. 

Antwerp auctioneer Campo is less concerned with market niches than with Belgium's crushing tax and auction-fee burden. "Everything has to be the same between countries," says Campo's Stefan Campo, who is asking clients to sign protest petitions. "Then there'll be fair competition." 

Ending tax-free shopping in the European Community after 1992 could threaten more than 3,000 jobs, the International Duty Free Confederation said.
Instead of banning such shopping, the confederation proposed amending controls to be sure the privilege isn't abused. . . . British and Argentine diplomats opened talks in Madrid aimed at restoring ties severed because of their 1982 war over the Falkland Islands.

ONE LIBERTY PROPERTIES Inc. declared a dividend of 40 cents a share on its $16.50 cumulative convertible preferred stock, payable Jan. 2 to stock of record Dec. 8.
But directors of the Great Neck, N.Y., real estate investment trust didn't act on the common stock dividend.
And they won't consider such a dividend, the trust added, before results are available for the first quarter of 1990.
In part, the trust cited the need to retain cash for possible acquisitions.
According to a spokesman, One Liberty will have paid out as dividends the required amount of its taxable income to maintain its legal status as a real estate investment trust. 

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer. 

Merc officials said Gary N. Roberts was disciplined following the exchange's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988.
The Merc said Mr. Roberts withheld from the market certain orders in cooperation with another trader, David Stein. 

The Merc fined Mr. Roberts $15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years.
Also, he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of $35,000 to a customer. 

Mr. Stein was fined $25,000 and suspended for three years. 

Messrs.
Roberts and Stein couldn't be reached for comment.
The Merc said that as part of the disciplinary settlement, neither man admitted, nor denied the alleged violations.
Neither was among the 46 traders indicted last August in a federal investigation of traders at both the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. 

An experimental vaccine can alter the immune response of people infected with the AIDS virus, a prominent U.S. scientist said. 

However, that doesn't mean they can benefit from the vaccine.
Its effectiveness can't be determined until a large clinical trial is undertaken by the Army in January, according to Robert Redfield, chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. 

Dr. Redfield's report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn., came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in Florida late Monday.
The vaccine, VaxSyn HIV-1, has been safely given to 14 people, some of whom are experiencing substantial increases in certain antibodies. 

"The conventional wisdom used to be that you couldn't modify the immune response of an infected individual" by innoculating them with synthetic viral proteins, Dr. Redfield said. "We've demonstrated that you can." 

He said certain volunteers developed kinds of antibodies associated with early AIDS. Other antibodies sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals, he added.
One of the mysteries of AIDS remains why infected people produce large quantities of antibodies, but deteriorate nonetheless. 

US Facilities Corp. said Robert J. Percival agreed to step down as vice chairman of the insurance holding company. 

"There was a difference of opinion as to the future direction of the company," a spokeswoman said.
Mr. Percival declined to comment. 

In a statement, US Facilities said Mr. Percival's employment contract calls for him to act as a consultant to the company for two years.
He will also remain a director, US Facilities said, but won't serve on any board committees. 

Mr. Percival will be succeeded on an interim basis by George Kadonada, US Facilities chairman and president. 

In the same statement, US Facilities also said it had bought back 112,000 of its common shares in a private transaction.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The buy-back represents about 3% of the company's shares, based on the 3.7 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, US Facilities closed at $3.625, unchanged. 

The federal government should make free, voluntary testing for the AIDS virus the cornerstone of an expanded campaign to stop the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the Hudson Institute recommended. 

"By encouraging massive, routine, voluntary testing we can enable society to voluntarily segregate itself sexually into two groups: those who carry the virus and those who do not," the Indianapolis research organization said in a new report. 

The report takes a more alarmed view of AIDS and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses.
It warns that the AIDS epidemic "may reduce the rate of growth of the work force, curb productivity gains and slow economic growth." 

It contends that current government policy is failing to stem the AIDS epidemic because it suggests the use of condoms can make sex "safe." But the report says: "The only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners," and testing is the only way to learn of infection. 

Hudson's researchers estimated that it would cost less than $650 million a year to test the entire population between the ages of 12 and 65 years old.
In addition, the report recommends that federal and state governments provide free treatment to all who test positive. 

In a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to Time Warner Inc. 's powerful Home Box Office, cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. agreed to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. from Viacom Inc. for $225 million. 

The purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between TCI and Viacom, which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators.
Showtime is a distant No. 2 to Home Box Office, and in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit against Time Warner, charging the company and its HBO and American Television cable units with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business. 

HBO has close to 24 million subscribers to its HBO and Cinemax networks, while Showtime and its sister service, The Movie Channel, have only about 10 million, according to Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., research firm. 

For TCI, the investment in Showtime puts it in an unusual position; as the largest cable operator, with control of close to 12 million of the nation's 52 million cable subscribers, TCI is HBO's largest customer.
But TCI President John Malone has long been concerned about HBO's dominance of the pay TV business, and has been eager to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor. "It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace," Mr. Malone said in a statement. 

In a telephone interview, Robert Thomson, TCI senior vice president, said Showtime's suit against HBO "doesn't involve us, and nothing we're doing here bears any relationship to that." He added, "We don't intend to be drawn into it," noting that TCI won't play any active role in the management of Showtime. 

Linking up Showtime with the largest cable operator in the U.S. could sharply boost its subscribers.
TCI said it may bring in other cable operators as investors, a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks, such as The Discovery Channel.
Additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further. 

Time Warner declined comment.
In addition to owning HBO, Time Warner owns American Television & Communications Inc., the nation's second largest cable operator after TCI. Viacom also owns cable systems, but it is the 14th largest operator of such systems, with less than one million subscribers. 

The TCI investment is a big victory for Viacom's chief executive officer, Frank Biondi, and Winston H. Cox, president of the Showtime unit. "This takes any question of Showtime's viability and puts it away once and for all," Mr. Biondi said in a telephone interview. 

The fight between HBO and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr. Biondi is the former chief executive of HBO, and Mr. Cox served as chief of marketing for the service.
They were both hired by Sumner Redstone, the Boston billionaire who took control of Viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy-out. 

Time Warner has vigorously denied all of Viacom's allegations. 

Eastern Airlines' creditors committee, unhappy with the carrier's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings, asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization. 

Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman, Sachs & Co., hired by creditors to consult on Eastern's financial plans, told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors' approval. 

According to one person present at the meeting, Eastern's new plan is financially "overly optimistic." 

Asked about the consultants' reports, an Eastern spokeswoman said "we totally disagree." She said they have "oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base." 

At a later news conference here, Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year, operating with more service than it originally had scheduled.
He insisted, as he has before, that creditors would be paid in full under the plan. 

Mr. Lorenzo made no mention of creditors' negative response to his plan. 

"We're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly," Mr. Lorenzo told reporters. "We're meeting and surpassing our goals," he added. 

In July, Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell $1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size.
But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle, its Philadelphia hub and various planes, Eastern hit a stumbling block.
It couldn't sell its South American routes, one of the major assets marked for disposal. 

Those routes, valued by the creditors' professionals at about $400 million, were to be sold to AMR Corp. 's American Airlines.
A last-minute snag in negotiations with AMR, over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit, caused the deal to collapse. 

Eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself, which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization.
It also would leave Eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan.
Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped. 

Since then, Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions, but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions.
The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern's plans.
Both said the new plan wouldn't work. 

Ernst & Young said Eastern's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest, tax and depreciation by $100 million, and that Eastern's plan presented no comfort level, according to a source present at yesterday's session. 

Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by $120 million to $135 million, the source said. 

The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs, and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated.
Other costs also would increase, including maintenance, because Eastern has an older fleet. 

At the news conference, Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment.
Flanked by flight attendants, pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms, they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats.
Starting next month, Eastern will begin flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700, they said. 

Mr. Bakes declined to give out Eastern's daily losses, but said he didn't expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow.
These accounts hold several hundred million dollars, primarily from asset sales.
The plan Eastern hopes to pursue, he said, calls for Eastern to have $390 million in cash by year's end.
Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January. 

As to negotiations with creditors, Mr. Lorenzo said in remarks after the conference "we'll have to see how they {talks} come along." However, he added, "it's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors.
It must be accepted by the court." 

Under bankruptcy law, Eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan.
That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again.
If Eastern can get creditor support, court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift.
But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan, or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own.
In any event, some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes.
Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4. 

Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85% to 90% of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern.
He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring, only slightly fewer than the carrier's old volume of 1,050 a day. 

A.F. Sloan, 60 years old, announced that he will retire next April as chairman and chief executive officer of this snack food and bakery products maker.
No replacement was immediately named.
Mr. Sloan plans to remain on the board until his current term expires in April 1991, a Lance spokesman said. 

The nations of southern Africa know a lot about managing elephants; their herds are thriving.
But the nations of Europe and North America have decided they know better.
At this week's U.N. conference in Lausanne, they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies. 

A Zimbabwean delegate argued that the ban would "guarantee the extinction of the elephant." Legitimate ranchers, who have an interest in preserving the herds, would go out of business.
Poachers would control the underground trade.
Many delegates were willing to craft a compromise, but U.S. delegate Constance Harriman and others thundered that down.
The Greens from the First World wanted a morality play, not a negotiation. 

Fortunately, the nations of southern Africa haven't totally surrendered their sovereignty.
Five countries announced they would not honor what one Zimbabwean delegate wryly called the "made in Switzerland" solution.
In fact, they seemed a mite resentful.
The director of Zimbabwe's Wildlife Department described American conservationists as "fat little puppies from urban environments who don't know a thing about Africa." That's not fair; they're not all fat. 

Amstrad PLC, a British maker of computer hardware and communications equipment, posted a 52% plunge in pretax profit for the latest year. 

The #76.6 million ($120.6 million) in pretax profit for the 12 months to June 30 was down from #160 million ($252 million) a year earlier and below market expectations of #80 million and #90 million. 

The slump in profit, which came despite steady sales, was attributed to increased costs for parts and problems with model introductions. 

Amstrad's profit after taxes fell a similarly steep 51%, to #51.1 million from #105 million a year earlier. 

Sales edged up fractionally to #626.3 million from #625.4 million a year earlier. 

NEWSPAPERS: Media General Inc. intends to sell two of its West Coast weekly newspaper chains, Golden West Publishing Inc. and Highlander Publications, which together comprise 31 papers.
Media General said it has had inquiries from potential buyers and expects to complete a sale in 1989.
It wouldn't discuss a price.
Lee Dirks & Associates is to sell the chains. 

The Boston Globe says its newly redesigned pages have a "crisper" look with revamped fixtures aimed at making the paper "more consistent" and "easier to read." 

Maybe so -- if you can find where your favorite writer went.
Beantown scribes, who spare no invective when taking on local luminaries such as Michael "Pee Wee" Dukakis, or New England Patriots Coach Raymond "Rev.
Ray" Berry, yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of Globe columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week.
By late last night, Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy, bending to the will of his troops, scrapped the new drawings.
For a few days at least, he says, no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns. 

Trouble was, nobody thought they looked right.
Globe columnist Mike Barnicle -- in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks -- averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad, it looked "like a face you'd find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime." Mr. Barnicle reminded readers that he still hasn't forgiven Globe management for questioning a $20 expense chit he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story. 

"I thought {the drawing} a cross between someone you'd spot whipping open his trench coat . . . or a guy who boasted he'd been Charles Manson's roommate for the last 19 years," he said.
Mr. Barnicle was hardly kinder to the renderings of colleagues Michael Madden ("appears to be a pervert"), Will McDonough ("looks as if he drove for Abe Lincoln") or Bella English, whose "little girl now screams hysterically every time she sees a newspaper." 

Lynn Staley, the Globe's assistant managing editor for design, acknowledges that the visages were "on the low end of the likeness spectrum." 

Rival Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr, who usually rails at Statehouse "hacks" and nepotism, argued that the new drawings were designed to hide Mr. Madden's "rapidly growing forehead" and the facial defects of "chinless" Dan Shaughnessy, a Globe sports columnist. 

"But think of the money you, the reader, will save on Halloween," said Mr. Barnicle. "Instead of buying masks for your kids, just cut out the columnists' pictures. . . ." 

NBC's winning streak has been canceled. 

The National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., had its record-breaking 68-week reign as the prime-time ratings leader snapped yesterday by ABC-TV, a subsidiary of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
In the ratings compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co., ABC, which broadcast the World Series, topped the competition with a 14.8 rating and 25 share. 

NBC was second with a 13.9 rating and 24 share followed by CBS Inc. 's television network with a 12.5 rating and 21 share. (A ratings point represents 904,000 television households; shares indicate the percentage of sets in use.) 

The first two games of the World Series between the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants didn't finish in the top 10; instead they landed in 16th and 18th place.
The highest-rated show continues to be ABC's "Roseanne." NBC had five of the top 10 shows; ABC had four and CBS had one. 

CBS held the previous record for consecutive No. 1 victories -- 46 weeks -- during the 1962-63 season. 

H. Anthony Ittleson was elected a director of this company, which primarily has interests in radio and television stations, increasing the number of seats to five.
Osborn also operates Muzak franchises, entertainment properties and small cable-television systems.
Mr. Ittleson is executive, special projects, at CIT Group Holdings Inc., which is controlled by Manufacturers Hanover Corp.

Banc One Corp. said Frank E. McKinney plans to retire as the bank holding company's president effective Jan. 12. 

Banc One said "it is contemplated" that John B. McCoy, chairman and chief executive officer, will assume the additional position of president upon Mr. McKinney's retirement. 

Mr. McKinney, 50 years old, was chairman and chief executive of American Fletcher Corp., Indianapolis, when that bank holding company merged into Banc One in January 1987.
The company said Mr. McKinney plans to retire because the process of affiliating American Fletcher into Banc One "is considered completed." 

Mr. McKinney will continue as chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee of Banc One Indiana Corp., the successor company to American Fletcher Corp., but will no longer be active in day-to-day management.
He will remain on the Banc One board. 

The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices. 

But bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market.
In early trading, investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that Friday's stock market debacle would be repeated. 

But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been down more than 60 points in midmorning, dashed those expectations.
Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $4 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt. 

"Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall," said Roger Early, a vice president at Federated Investors Inc., Pittsburgh. "When stocks stabilized, that was a disappointment." 

Meanwhile, for the second straight day, the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve's open market operations.
Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging $1.5 billion of repurchase agreements during the usual pre-noon intervention period.
The move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence. 

"The intervention has been friendly, meaning that they really didn't have to do it," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, money-market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
She said a more aggressive move wasn't needed. 

The Fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further.
It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline 1/4 percentage point to about 8 3/4% from its previous target level of about 9%.
The rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy.
It ended at about 8 11/16% yesterday, but was as low as 8 1/2% Monday. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 1/2 point, or over $5 for each $1,000 face amount, while the yield moved above 8% for the first time since Thursday.
Investment-grade corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed securities also fell. 

But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain-hunting by institutional investors.
Some so-called high-quality junk issues, such as R.H. Macy & Co. 's 14 1/2% subordinated debentures, rose.
The Macy's issue closed up about one point at a bid price of 97. 

The TVA's public debt offering was its first in 15 years.
Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from $3 billion. 

Traders said hedging related to the TVA pricing also pressured Treasury bonds. "Underwriters of the TVA bonds reduced their market risk by selling Treasurys to cover at least part of their {TVA} holdings," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. 

The TVA bonds also "served to remind the market that there will be even more new supply," said Lawrence N. Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities & Co. 

Today the Treasury will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and Resolution Funding Corp. will announce details of its first bond offering.
Some traders estimate $9.75 billion of new two-year Treasurys will be sold next week, and they expect Refcorp to offer $4 billion to $6 billion of long-term "bailout" bonds.
Refcorp was created to help fund the thrift bailout. 

Another agency issue came to market yesterday.
The Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Banks said it priced a four-part $2.27 billion bond offering for the banks to yield from 8.125% to 8.375%. 

The release of several economic reports had little impact on the market, including a report that the U.S. trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide $10.77 billion in August, up from a revised $8.24 billion in July.
The August gap was expected to have expanded to $9.1 billion. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury securities were essentially flat to about 1/2 point lower. 

The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 100 28/32 to yield 8.04%, compared with 101 19/32 to yield 7.97% Monday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 99 25/32 to yield 8.01%, compared with 100 1/32 to yield 7.97%. 

Short-term rates increased.
The discount rate on three-month bills rose to 7.52% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75%.
The rate on six-month bills rose to 7.53% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.92%. 

Corporate, Other Issues 

Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1/4 to 1/2 point lower, while most junk bonds ended unchanged. 

The TVA's huge $4 billion offering dominated attention in the new-issue market.
TVA offered $2 billion of 30-year bonds priced to yield 9.06%; $1 billion in 10-year notes priced to yield 8.42%; and $1 billion in five-year notes priced to yield 8.33%. 

The TVA, which operates one of the nation's largest electric power systems, is a corporation wholly owned by the U.S. government.
Yesterday's bond sale was part of a $6.7 billion refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the TVA owes the Federal Financing Bank, an arm of the Treasury. 

Meanwhile, Lockheed Corp. priced a $300 million note offering to yield 9.39%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

The derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief hiatus as two new Remics totaling $850 million were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today. 

The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading.
Dealers noted that it's difficult to structure new Remics when prices are moving widely. 

The two Remics priced were a $500 million Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issue underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc. and a $350 million Federal National Mortgage Association deal underwritten by Greenwich Capital Markets. 

The Remic issuance supported prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities, which held up better than Government National Mortgage Association securities during an afternoon sell-off. 

Ginnie Mae 9% securities for November delivery ended at 97 29/32, down 7/32; 9 1/2% securities at 99 31/32, down 6/32; and 10% securities at 101 29/32, down 5/32.
Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 97 5/32, down 3/32. 

The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.43% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.42 percentage points. 

Municipals 

Confusion over the near-term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena, as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds. 

Long tax-exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to 3/8 point lower after a whipsaw session of moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer-led trading. 

Prices of pre-refunded municipal bonds were capped by news that Chemical Securities Inc., as agent for a customer, will accept bids today for two large lists of bonds that include many such issues.
The lists total $654.5 million.
Pre-refunded bonds are called at their earliest call date with the escrowed proceeds of another bond issue. 

Meanwhile, several new issues were priced. 

Underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. set preliminary pricing for $144.4 million of California Health Facilities Financing Authority revenue bonds for Kaiser Permanente.
Tentative reoffering yields were set from 6.25% in 1993 to 7.227% in 2018. 

As part of its College Savings Plan, Connecticut offered $100.4 million of general obligation capital appreciation bonds priced to yield to maturity from 6.25% in 1994 to 6.90% in 2006, 2007 and 2009. 

A Chemical Securities group won a $100 million Oregon general obligation veterans' tax note issue due Nov. 1, 1990.
The 6 3/4% notes yield 6.25%. 

Foreign Bonds 

West German government bond prices took a wild roller-coaster ride, pulled down by Monday's U.S. stock market gains then up by a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit and falling U.S. stock prices. 

West Germany's 7% bond due October 1999 was at 99.95 late yesterday, off 0.10 point from Monday, to yield 7.01%.
The 6 3/4% notes due April 1994 were up 0.10 point to 97.85 to yield 7.31%. 

British government bonds surged on renewed volatility in the stock market.
The Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 23/32 to 112 10/32 to yield 10.03%. 

But Japanese bonds ended weaker.
The benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at a price of 96, off 0.15 point to yield 5.27%. 

The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission: 

Canada's Province of Nova Scotia, shelf offering of up to $550 million of debentures. 

Golar Gas Holding Co., a subsidiary of Gotaas-Larsen Shipping Corp., offering of $280 million first preferred ship mortgage notes, via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 

H.F. Ahmanson & Co., offering of four million shares of noncumulative convertible preferred stock, Series B., via Goldman, Sachs & Co, First Boston Corp., and Merrill Lynch. 

Shared Technologies Inc., offering of 2.5 million common shares, via Smetek, Van Horn & Cormack Inc. and Oakes, Fitzwilliams & Co. 

The days may be numbered for animated shows featuring Alf, the Karate Kid and the Chipmunks. 

NBC, a leader in morning, prime-time and late night programs but an also-ran on Saturday mornings, when children rule the TV set, is contemplating getting out of the cartoon business.
Instead, network officials say, it may "counterprogram" with shows for an audience that is virtually ignored in that time period: adults. 

"There is talk of some revamping and we're certainly heading in the direction of less and less animation," said Joseph S. Cicero, vice president of finance and administration for National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co. 

Mr. Cicero said that NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff, who declined to be interviewed, is "looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by mid-season." He declined to elaborate. 

NBC's options could range from news-oriented programming to sports shows, although the network declined to comment. 

One major NBC affiliate, KCRA in Sacramento, plans to cancel the NBC Saturday morning line-up as of January and replace it with a local newscast.
The one-hour program will be repeated with updates throughout Saturday mornings. 

"We feel there is an opportunity for an audience that is not being served by any network, so we want to take the lead," says KCRA's general manager, John Kueneke. "We don't need cartoons anymore.
They only accounted for 5%, at best, of the station's total revenues." 

An NBC spokesman says the network will "closely monitor" the Sacramento situation, and says it is the only station to defect.
Spokesmen for the television networks of CBS Inc. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc., say there are no plans to alter the children's line-up on Saturday mornings. 

The youthful audience for Saturday programming is no longer dependent on the networks.
There has been a surge in syndicated children's shows to independent stations, as well as competition from videocassettes for kids and from cable outlets such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. 

At the same time, there appears to be a market for news-oriented programming; Turner Broadcasting System Inc. 's Cable News Network has its highest ratings, outside of prime time, on Saturday mornings. 

NBC has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a Saturday version of "Today," which is produced by NBC News.
The network's own production company, NBC Productions, supplies a half-hour family-oriented show titled "Saved By The Bell." NBC Productions or NBC News could supply the network with other Saturday morning shows, a move that would control costs.
Animated shows, which are made by outside production companies, cost the network about $300,000 per episode. 

Conservatives have an important decision to make this fall.
At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the IMF's capital base.
While the U.S. share of the increase probably will not reach the $12 billion or more implicit in the IMF's request for a doubling of its $90 billion capital, the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase.
This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and G-7 exchange-rate intervention, and with its financial commitment to Mexico, Poland and others. 

The IMF has several reasons for requesting the increase.
Its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s.
The size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the Brady Plan, which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved countries. 

At least three other factors have encouraged the IMF to insist on increased capital.
First, it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets, for which it feels some responsibility.
Second, the World Bank's recent $75 billion capital increase -- $14 billion from the U.S. -- has left the IMF feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions.
Third, the IMF would like to meet Japan's request for increased ownership (currently 4.5%).
Japan has supported a larger role for the IMF in developing-country debt issues, and is an important financial resource for IMF-guided programs in developing countries. 

While international politics may argue for the capital increase, there is a clear economic case against it.
Opponents of the increase argue that the IMF practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments.
They question whether the IMF has any role in developing countries, given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in balance-of-payments emergencies. 

Opponents show that there are already more funds available than commendable reform efforts.
They worry that new IMF funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting IMF debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt, a bad trade all around.
They believe microeconomics, which addresses the problems of markets, investment climate and management practices, is the key to developing-country growth, not the IMF's Keynesian focus on trade deficits, quarterly targets and government debt.
They point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated, taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive IMF programs. 

Decisions on increases in the IMF's capital base traditionally are made by the administration, with subsequent authorization by Congress.
The last U.S. congressional authorization, in 1983, was a political donnybrook and carried a $6 billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes. 

The politics of the 1990 congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations.
Liberals may support the stabilizing, quasi-governmental role of the IMF on two conditions: that the administration give assurances that liberal Democrats' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns; and that the legislation address -- with dollars -- social and environmental concerns.
Conservative Republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party's popular president in an election year. 

A U.S. decision to refuse the IMF its capital increase, or limit it to 25%, would bring a major change in international economic policy, and could not be taken lightly.
Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets.
Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase, a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged.
Furthermore, a U.S. rejection of the capital increase (and transfer of shares to Japan) would give Japan an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing. 

On the other hand, a decision to increase the IMF's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries.
With the increase, even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate IMF-approved economic plans.
Upping the ante could slow economic development even further, as countries delay market-opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support. 

Conservatives should take a position prior to the administration's year-end deadline.
The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase, rather than its purpose.
If conservatives don't support an increase in the IMF's capital, then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative.

Stock-market tremors again shook bond prices, while the dollar turned in a mixed performance. 

Early yesterday, investors scrambled to buy Treasury bonds for safety as stock prices plummeted and fears mounted of a replay of Friday.
But stocks later recovered, erasing most of their early declines.
That cut short the rally in Treasury bonds and depressed prices moderately below late Monday's levels. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down more than 60.25 points early in the day, finished 18.65 points lower at 2638.73.
Long-term Treasury issues declined about half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. 

"The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets," said Jack Conlon, an executive vice president at Nikko Securities. "People are breathing a major sigh of relief that the world didn't end Monday morning" or yesterday. 

Gold, a closely watched barometer of investor anxiety, was little changed.
The dollar initially fell against other major currencies on news that the U.S. trade deficit surged in August to $10.77 billion.
But the dollar later rebounded, finishing slightly higher against the yen although slightly lower against the mark. 

Federal Reserve officials sent another signal of their determination to shore up investor confidence.
In an apparent attempt to keep a lid on short-term interest rates, the Fed once again pumped money into the banking system.
But the Fed move was a small gesture, traders said. 

Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move doesn't appear necessary, several investment managers said.
The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest rate to decline about one-quarter percentage point.
The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around 8 3/4%, down from 9% previously. 

Although stocks have led bonds this week, some traders predict that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks.
Nikko's Mr. Conlon fears a huge wave of Treasury borrowing early next month will drive down Treasury bond prices.
That, coupled with poor third-quarter corporate-earnings comparisons, "will make trouble for the equity market for the next two to three months," he says. 

But several other traders contend investors have overreacted to junk-bond jitters, and that stock prices will continue to recover. "They shot the whole orchestra just because the piano player hit a bad note," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates Inc., referring to the stock market's plunge Friday on news of trouble in financing the UAL Corp. buy-out. 

In major market activity: 

Treasury bond prices fell.
The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds climbed back above 8%, ending the day at 8.03%. 

The dollar was mixed.
Late yesterday in New York, the dollar rose to 142.75 yen from 141.80 yen Monday, but fell to 1.8667 marks from 1.8685 marks. 

The average interest rate fell to 8.292% at Citicorp's $50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs, from 8.483% at last week's sale. 

Bids totaling $465 million were submitted, and accepted bids were at 8.292%. 

Citicorp also said that the average rate fell to 7.986% at its $50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 8.1255% at last week's sale. 

Bids totaling $415 million were submitted, and accepted bids were at 7.986%. 

The bank holding company will auction another $50 million of commercial paper in each maturity next Tuesday. 

Directors elected R. Marvin Womack, currently vice president/product supply, purchasing, to head the company's Washington, D.C., office.
As vice president/national-government relations, Mr. Womack will work with P&G's top management and with the company's government-relations staff "to represent P&G's interests at the federal level," said John G. Smale, chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr. Smale said the appointment "recognizes the growing influence of government on our business." Mr. Womack, 53 years old, has been with the big producer of household products, food and pharmaceuticals for 30 years. 

Industrial production declined 0.1% in September, reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend. 

The Federal Reserve Board said output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of 1.3% in the third quarter, substantially slower than the 3.3% annual rate in the second quarter. 

"Capital spending and exports, which have been the driving force in this expansion, are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them," said Robert Dederick, economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 

The new reports of sluggishness, which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September, give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates. "They need to do something about this," said Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Group Inc. 

The Fed also said U.S. industry operated at 83.6% of capacity last month, down from 83.8% in August. 

Measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures.
Factory output dropped 0.2%, its first decline since February, after having been unchanged in October.
Factories operated at 83.7% of capacity, the lowest rate in more than a year and down from 84.1% in September. 

The declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods, those intended to last more than three years.
The biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers, a category that includes the steel industry. 

Output of business equipment was unchanged in September.
Production of factory equipment, one indication of the strength of manufacturers' investment spending, fell 0.3%. 

Some economists expect further declines in investment spending. "Whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently," Mr. Harris said. "You haven't seen the full effect of that yet." 

A decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies, the Fed noted.
Analysts don't expect the September surge in auto production to be repeated in the coming months. 

Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production in September.
The figures are seasonally adjusted. 142.3% of the 1977 average. 

J.P. Morgan & Co., New York, will help the statutory managers of DFC New Zealand Ltd. to evaluate the failed investment bank's condition. 

Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the country's central bank, appointed the managers to run the investment bank and pay creditors.
DFC asked the central bank to appoint managers after it revised loan-loss provisions to around the same level of shareholders' funds of 180 million New Zealand dollars (US$105.4 million). 

DFC is held 80% by National Provident Fund, New Zealand's largest pension fund, and 20% by Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment-bank and securities-firm subsidiary of Salomon Inc. in New York. 

A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan, parent of the bank Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., confirmed its appointment to assist the managers but declined to elaborate. 

The managers said in a brief statement yesterday that Morgan will help evaluate DFC's position and help determine alternatives.
The managers don't expect to complete the evaluation until Nov. 30. 

Traders trying to profit from the recent volatility in financial markets invaded the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, prompting even more swings in stock prices. 

After gaining strength during a brief run-up when trading began, the Nasdaq Composite Index weakened under selling pressure.
The forces at work included computer-guided trading, as well as profit-driven market makers and institutional investors who had bought stock on the cheap during the recent correction.
During the last two hours of trading, the composite almost drew even on the day before slipping again.
The Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.05, or 0.2%, to 459.93. 

The action was confined to Nasdaq's biggest and most liquid stocks, traders said.
The Nasdaq 100 Index began the day at 449.89, lost 2% at one point, and was up 0.4% at another.
The barometer of the biggest nonfinancial stocks settled at 448.49, off 1.40. 

Its counterpart, the Nasdaq Financial Index, was weak for most of the day, sliding 2.51 to 453.57 by the end of trading. 

The volatility was dizzying for traders. "The market must have turned up and down 15 different times," commented Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody. "Every time you thought it was going into a rally it gave up, and every time you thought it would rally it came down.
This is a tough market." 

Mr. Zipper said the market is still settling down after the recent correction.
Most of trading action now is from professional traders who are trying to take advantage of the price swings to turn a quick profit, he and other traders said. "Everybody's confused and no one has an opinion that lasts longer than 30 seconds," said Mr. Zipper. "A lot of the professional traders are just going back and forth.
They're just as confused." 

William Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex.
Brown & Sons, in Baltimore, said program trading is keeping the markets unsettled.
He believes that the volatile conditions created by program trading has "thoroughly confused" investors about where the market is headed.
Program trading is "benefiting a few to the detriment of many and I wish someone would do something about it," he complained. 

Trading activity cooled off from Monday's sizzling pace.
Share turnover subsided to 161.5 million.
Advancing and declining issues finished about even.
Of the 4,345 stocks that changed hands, 1,174 declined and 1,040 advanced. 

One big technology issue, Novell, rode the roller coaster.
The stock, which finished Monday at 29 1/2, traded as high as 29 3/4 and as low as 28 3/4 before closing at 29 1/4, down 1/4. 

It was a jarring day for investors in Genetics Institute.
The stock tumbled 2 3/4 on news that it might have to take a charge against earnings if it can't successfully resolve a dispute with its European licensee, Boehringer Mannheim, over its anti-anemia drug, EPO.
The stock recovered somewhat to finish 1 1/4 lower at 26 1/4. 

In a statement, Genetics Institute said the dispute with Boehringer centers on questions of the usability of certain batches of EPO material valued at $13.6 million.
Earlier this week, Genetics Institute reported wider losses in its fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31. 

Price Co. jumped 2 1/4 to 44 on 1.7 million shares.
The wholesaler of cash and carry merchandise reported fiscal fourthquarter earnings that were better than analysts had expected.
The company also pleased analysts by announcing four new store openings planned for fiscal 1990, ending next August.
That will bring the total for the year to 10, from five during fiscal 1989. 

"Every year we've been waiting for stepped-up expansion from the company.
The news couldn't have been better," said Linda Kristiansen, a Dean Witter Reynolds analyst, in an interview. 

Intermec, a maker of optical character-recognition devices, also reported higher third-quarter earnings.
Its shares added 3/4 to 30 3/4. 

But favorable earnings wasn't a guarantee that a stock's price would improve yesterday.
MCI Communications tumbled 2 5/8 to 42 3/8 on 4.7 million shares even though the telecommunications giant reported a 63% increase in third-quarter profit. 

CoreStates Financial slipped 3/8 to 43 1/8 in active trading after reporting that third-quarter earnings improved to $1.27 a share from $1.15 a share a year earlier.
However, the bank holding company's loan-loss reserves rose to $177.3 million from $154 million a year earlier. 

A&W Brands lost 1/4 to 27.
But its thirdquarter earnings rose to 26 cents a share from 18 cents a share last year. 

Capital Associates dropped 1 to 5 3/8.
The company, which leases technology equipment, reported substantially lower net income for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Aug. 31. 

We're sorry to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.
Mr. Allen, appointed by President Reagan, grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies. 

His recent speech, provocatively titled "Blacks?
Animals?
Homosexuals?
What is a Minority?" caused an uproar when its title leaked out.
Mr. Allen's commissioners voted to call his unread speech "thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory." Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was "another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman." Rep. Don Edwards, the California Democrat, warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be "outside the scope of the commission's jurisdiction." Thomas Stoddard, head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, called the prospect of the speech "frankly shocking." 

We've actually read the speech. 

Mr. Allen began it with a warning to his hosts, a California church group that opposes rights for homosexuals.
He said that other participants in the conference "do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual," but that "I mean to persuade you to the opposite view." 

He recalled to the audience a "strange, infelicitous" analogy he once heard arguing "now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights, we need to do the same for animals." Mr. Allen objected to this analogy because it seems to "assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a mere project of charity, of humaneness." Rights on such a basis, whether for blacks or homosexuals, are "mere indulgences," he said, subject to being taken back. 

He says the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals, not as members of certain select groups.
His speech criticized the "idiocy of notions of protected groups in society" as opposed to individual equality or, as he put it, in "a common destiny as Americans." Instead of lobbying for special treatment, Mr. Allen said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk "invidious retrenchment with government complicity." 

This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed.
What's really going on here? 

The three most important things to understand about Mr. Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual -- a triple threat to the liberal establishment.
Mr. Allen, who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission, has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals' rights.
He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non-Indian parents off her reservation.
Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again, which somehow elevated the vague concept of "Indian rights" above the rights of individual Indians. 

There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen's we're-all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups.
Indeed, the gap is so large that Mr. Allen's critics refuse to engage the debate.
Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument.
Their effort to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement.
We hope the next head of the Civil Rights Commission will be as brave as Mr. Allen in making the case for equality of civil rights. 

Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered ratings on about $650 million of Beatrice Co. debt, citing the closely held Chicago food concern's proposed recapitalization. 

The ratings concern said it downgraded Beatrice notes, Euronotes and certain industrial revenue bonds to single-B-1 from Ba-3 and the company's subordinated debentures to single-B-3 from single-B-2. 

Moody's said the proposed recaptilization may "limit the company's ability to realize its profit potential" and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze "basic business operations." A Beatrice spokesman didn't return calls seeking comment. 

Beatrice, which went private in an $8.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986, said last month that it might borrow again to help pay investors as much as $983 million in preferred stock and debt securities. 

Banks are continuing to go after individual investors, despite falling interest rates. 

Yields on small-denomination certificates of deposit fell at about half the rate of so-called jumbo CDs this week, according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service based here.
Investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below $50,000 than they can on deposits of $90,000 and up. 

"Banks want to remain competitive," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. "October is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand . . . among people leaving the stock market." 

Some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about CDs since Friday. "Reports from branches are that there has been greater interest in the last day or so," said Steven Braitman, a vice president at Chemical Bank in New York.
Chemical said deposits Monday were about $5 million higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock. 

"This is no time to be playing in the street . . . the Dow has more ups and downs than an elevator," proclaimed an advertisement Monday in New York newspapers, touting Lincoln Savings Bank's one-year CD. Harold Jones, Lincoln's chief retail banking officer, said there hasn't yet been "a discernible response," although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week. 

Friday's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for CD rollovers, when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way.
First National Bank of Boston, for example, is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and 12-month CDs. 

Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in the latest week.
New York's Citibank, for instance, increased the yield on small-denomination three-month CDs to 8% from 7.9%.
On average, however, three-month CDs at major banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage point less than they were a week ago. 

Average yields on CDs aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction.
Six-month CDs of $50,000 and less yielded an average 8.02% in the week ended Tuesday, down from 8.10%, according to Banxquote.
The yield on six-month T-bills fell to 7.82% on Monday, from 8.01% the week before. 

Meanwhile, the average yield on six-month CDs of more than $90,000 fell to 7.93% in the latest week, according to Banxquote, from 8.10% the week before.
Mr. Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs, but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding. 

CDs sold by major brokerage houses, which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest rate trends, also posted larger drops in yields.
A six-month, broker-sold CD, for example, was yielding an average 8.09% in the latest week, a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before.
In late April, when interest rates were at their recent highs, short-term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks. 

CD yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks. "What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit" reported yesterday "make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise" any time soon, said Mr. Mehl of Banxquote. 

"Even before the market drop, rates were down about half a percentage point," said Robert J. Hutchinson, senior vice president for retail marketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. "That puts pressure on CD rates." 

Robert M. Jelenic, 39, was named president and chief operating officer of this closely held publisher.
The post had been vacant for more than a year.
Mr. Jelenic had been executive vice president for operations.
In addition, Ralph Ingersoll II, 43, chairman and chief executive, said he would take on additional responsibilities as editor in chief of the company.
John Wilpers resigned as editor in chief.
Mr. Ingersoll remains editor in chief of the company's recently launched daily, the St. Louis Sun.
Also, Jean B. Clifton, 28, was named executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer.
Michael Applebaum resigned after less than a year in the posts.
Ms. Clifton had been executive financial assistant to the chairman. 

Frank Carlucci III was named to this telecommunications company's board, filling the vacancy created by the death of William Sobey last May.
Mr. Carlucci, 59 years old, served as defense secretary in the Reagan administration.
In January, he accepted the position of vice chairman of Carlyle Group, a merchant banking concern. 

Lung-cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline, federal researchers report. 

The drop is particularly large for white males, although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates. 

A report in this week's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also projects that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate. 

The report, which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking, is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer. "What this is saying is that the surgeon general's message is having an impact," said Melvyn Tockman, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. 

The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart.
The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000, but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6, a decline of 28.7%.
Measured the same way, the decline for black males was 14.2%.
The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep -- 8.9% for blacks and 5.3% for whites. 

The study, by Susan Devesa, William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute's staff, also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35-44 age bracket, except black men. 

Although lung-cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole, the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year 2000 for women. 

Lung-cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over 55, with sharp increases for everybody but white men.
But Dr. Fraumeni, one of the authors of the report, said "the declining rates we're seeing for younger people we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future." However, he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking. 

"Even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups, they can't be taken for granted," the report says. "Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population, especially children, adolescents and minorities." 

An editorial in the NCI Journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality "among young men and women in the U.S. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $2 billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking." 

But the editorial, by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization, notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries. "Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior" around the world, the editorial says, through the enactment of laws that limit advertising, boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education. 

Asked for comment, Walker Merryman, a vice president of the Tobacco Institute, said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the U.S. could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech. 

According to the American Cancer Society, smoking is responsible for 85% of the lung-cancer cases among men and 75% among women.
The NCI report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns.
A higher proportion of black men smoke than white men.
While nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke, in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks. 

In comparing changes in mortality rates over the past decade, the NCI study looked only at blacks and whites.
Asians and native Americans weren't studied; Hispanics were included with whites. 

Recent changes in average annual age-specific lung-cancer rates per 100,000 population by race and sex.

A House-Senate conference approved an estimated $67 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill that provides a 28% increase for space research and development and incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market. 

The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to $124,875.
Separately, the bill gives authority to the Bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and moderate-income homeowners. 

The second provision, affecting so-called 235 mortgages, has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by the Public Securities Association.
And a squad of influential former Senate aides employed by the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers came to the Capitol in a vain attempt to strip the provision.
By an 11-2 margin, Senate negotiators voted to preserve the 235 mortgage refinancing plan, and despite powerful allies, the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives. 

The government currently is subsidizing an estimated 23,000 loans above 11% under the 235 program, and however disruptive to private investors, the refinancing is expected to yield at least $15 million in savings in fiscal 1990.
This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere, and conservative Sen. Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests. "We are stewards here, not of the mortgage companies, but the taxpayers," said the Texas Republican. 

The action came as the administration won final congressional approval of $9 million in assistance for elections scheduled in Nicaragua in February.
The bulk of the money would be funneled through the National Endowment for Democracy, but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money's true purpose and its ultimate destination. 

The Senate had refused late Friday to invoke cloture and limit debate, but behind the bipartisan leadership, a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties.
Final approval -- on a 64-35 roll call -- was never in doubt, but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators, including Republicans Jesse Helms and Warren Rudman and Democrats Bill Bradley and John Glenn. 

The money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring, but more than half is likely to go to the Union Nacional Opositora party.
Critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party's standing, and one irony is that under Nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party's funds must be shared with the government's Supreme Electoral Council. 

Within the appropriations conference yesterday, the $67 billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science, housing, veterans and the environment.
The decision to raise the ceiling on FHA home loans still faces strong opposition in the House.
But it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle as much as $1 billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget. 

These costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal 1991, and the measure further commits Congress to a set of costly projects, including the first construction funds for the space station.
The station is promised $1.8 billion within the $5.36 billion provided for research and development in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the nation's high-speed aerospace plane -- cut by the Senate -- could receive as much as $60 million in new funds or transfers. 

Similarly, the House agreed to add back $62 million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite, being developed by General Electric Co.
And while setting a statutory limit of $1.6 billion on the automated space probe, the conference appropriated $30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission, a successor to the Voyager space probe. 

Among major domestic agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration, with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14% to about $829.9 million.
An estimated $1.57 billion is separately allocated for the National Science Foundation, and within the Housing and Urban Development Department, more than $9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing, including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families. 

To an unusual degree, the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states.
While the practice was discouraged in the past, the conference agreement is laced with veterans' hospitals, environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities.
The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds, where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $20 million, and the conference added 15 more valued at $8 million to ostensibly preserve "balance" between the House and Senate. 

Yesterday's conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week, as appropriators approved a fiscal 1990 transportation bill late Monday that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights.
An exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to Hawaii and Alaska, but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about 30 flights would be covered. 

Separately, a third conference report covering an $18.4 billion Treasury and Postal Service bill was sent to the Senate after passing the House on a 383-30 roll call yesterday.
And after weeks of delay, the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape.
Defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration's standpoint.
And among domestic programs, the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services.
The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate, and Mr. Bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate-passed provisions renewing U.S. support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. 

In a sharply written letter, Rep. David Obey, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations, warned Mr. Bush that the result of his "ultimatum" could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere. "As a result of your ultimatum," writes the Wisconsin Democrat, "I guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference, inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill." 

Reuben Mark, chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co., said he is "comfortable" with analysts' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to between 95 cents and $1.05 a share.
That compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of 69 cents the year earlier; including discontinued operations, per-share was 88 cents a year ago. 

The per-share estimates mean the consumer-products company's net income, increased to between $69.5 million and $76 million, from $47.1 million the year-before period.
Analysts estimate Colgate's world-wide third-quarter sales rose about 8% to $1.29 billion. 

Mr. Mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in Latin America, Asia and Europe.
Results were also bolstered by "a very meaningful" increase in operating profit by Colgate's U.S. business, Mr. Mark said. 

Operating profit at Colgate's U.S. household products and personal-care businesses jumped 25% in the quarter, Mr. Mark added.
He said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations, blending two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company's promotional activities. 

The estimated improvement in Colgate's U.S. operations took some analysts by surprise.
Colgate's household products business, which includes such brands as Fab laundry detergent and Ajax cleanser, has been a weak performer.
Analysts estimate Colgate's sales of household products in the U.S. were flat for the quarter, and they estimated operating margins at only 1% to 3%. "If you could say their business in the U.S. was mediocre, but great everywhere else, that would be fine," says Bonita Austin, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co. "But it's not mediocre, it's a real problem." 

Mr. Mark conceded that Colgate's domestic business, apart from its highly profitable Hill's Pet Products unit, has lagged. "We've done a lot to improve {U.S.} results, and a lot more will be done," Mr. Mark said. "Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company." 

To focus on its global consumer-products business, Colgate sold its Kendall health-care business in 1988. 

Thomas H. Johnson, president of the Coatedboard division of Mead Corp., was named president of Manville Forest Products Corp., a Manville unit, and senior vice president of Manville Corp. Mr. Johnson succeeds Harry W. Sherman, who resigned to pursue other interests, in both positions.
Manville is a building and forest products concern. 

Bankers Trust New York Corp. became the latest major U.S. bank to increase reserves for its loans to less-developed countries, making a $1.6 billion third-quarter addition to its provision.
The bank also said it expects to report a $1.42 billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year. 

The new reserves bring the company's provision for loans to Third World countries to $2.6 billion, or 85% of Bankers Trust's medium and long-term loans to these countries. 

"Step up to the plate and take the big swing.
Get the problem behind you and don't look back," said James J. McDermott, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in approving of the move.
Bankers Trust "has had the capacity to do this for some time," the analyst said.
He expects Citicorp to take a similar step this year. 

Citicorp yesterday reported a 9% third-quarter earnings drop, which analysts called a bit disappointing, while Manufacturers Hanover Corp. posted a $789 million loss for the quarter after adding $950 million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries. 

Three other major U.S. banks posted earnings increases.
Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco posted a 17% jump.
PNC Financial Corp., the parent of Pittsburgh National Bank, reported net income climbed 9.8%, while net for Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, grew 3.8%. 

Citicorp 

Analysts were only slightly disappointed by Citicorp's numbers. "There's nothing in here that's horrible and nothing to make you think they're setting the world on fire," said Carole Berger, analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. Earnings from the bank's global consumer business grew 27%. "The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream," said Mr. McDermott of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. 

Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were "relatively flat, sometimes choppy," the bank said, and profit for the area sank 27%. 

The cross-border loan portfolio reflected "adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns," the bank said no interest payments from Argentina in the nine months and none from Brazil in the third quarter, while Venezuela brought itself "substantially current." Overall, the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $70 million from $80 million a year earlier. 

"People were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision" for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries, a Citicorp spokesman said.
But he reiterated the bank's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $2.6 billion, covering about 30% of the $8.9 billion of such loans outstanding. 

Ronald I. Mandle, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., called Citicorp's venture-capital gains of $93 million before taxes "strong." A "concerning" item the analyst cited was the 10% jump in expenses, which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business.
Citicorp's spokesman said, however, that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth. 

Wells Fargo 

Wells Fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks, minimizing a drop in net interest margin with 13% third-quarter growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages.
Its margin fell only seven basis points, or 7/100ths of a percentage point, from a year ago, compared with a 13-point drop at Security Pacific Corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country. 

As a result, Wells Fargo's net interest income rose $36.3 million, or 7%, to $537 million for the quarter.
Non-interest income fell slightly to $191.9 million from $193.3 million, while Wells Fargo continued to rigorously control non-interest expense, which was almost flat at $393.4 million. 

The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave Wells Fargo a 1.25% return on average assets for the quarter, about 40% higher than Security Pacific's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the U.S. Wells Fargo's return on equity increased to 24.4% from 23.8%. 

Wells Fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries, and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans, which fell 8% from the previous quarter to $806.8 million from $880.9 million.
But the amount was still 39% higher than the year-ago level, and 25% higher as a percentage of total loans.
That trend, and Wells Fargo's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs, are about the only worries analysts have about Wells Fargo's financial picture.
Wells Fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve, which increased to $711 million at Sept. 30 from $664 million the previous quarter but was down from $852 million a year ago, when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans. 

Manufacturers Hanover 

Manufacturers Hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves, certain tax benefits, and a one-time $16 million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company, third-quarter earnings were $75 million.
The comparable year-earlier number was $56 million, a spokesman said. 

The bank's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $2.4 billion, covering 36% of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations. 

The net interest margin-the difference between the bank's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter, as did certain areas of wholesale banking. 

Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48%, to $21 million. "We didn't take part in a lot of deals" in the quarter "because their credit quality was poor," the spokesman said.
Expenses unrelated to interest rose 5.4%, to $541 million. 

PNC Financial 

PNC Financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs. 

Net interest income in the third quarter edged up 1.4%, to $317.7 million.
Trust income grew 15%, to $49.9 million, while service charges, fees and commissions increased 22%, to $79.4 million. 

The bank's total allowance for credit losses was $502.1 million, or 1.82% of total loans. 

Luis Nogales, 45 years old, has been elected to the board of this brewer.
Mr. Nogales, former president of United Press International and the Univision Spanish-language network, most recently co-founded Nogales Castro Partners, a California-based media acquisition firm.
Mr. Nogales, the first Hispanic person to serve as a Coors director, is an addition to the board, increasing its membership to nine. 

It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought.
Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature, and not to courts.
Beginning in the early 19th century, with U.S. v.
Hudson and Goodwin, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal, while well established in British law, would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers. 

That's the conventional theory anyway.
In practice, however, the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur.
In particular, a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade.
For example, although insider trading has long been criminal, it has never been statutorily defined.
In 1983, the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v.
SEC decision, which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain "some personal gain" and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact. 

Gradually, however, lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point.
Consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of Robert Chestman. 

Prior to a tender offer by A&P for Waldbaum Inc. in 1986, the founder of the Waldbaum's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery.
She called her daughter to take her to the bank, who, in turn, persuaded her husband, a Mr. Loeb, to run this errand.
Hearing of this information, the husband discussed it with his broker, Mr. Chestman, and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients.
Basically, Mr. Chestman was a fourth-level tippee.
Did Mr. Loeb, his tipper, breach a fiduciary duty (and, if so, to whom)?
Did Mr. Loeb seek personal gain (and if so, how)?
Or did Mr. Chestman only hear a market rumor (which one may lawfully trade upon)?
The line seems awfully thin for criminal-law purposes. 

A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by Robert Freeman, formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co. Essentially, Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out, when he was told by another prominent trader, Bernard "Bunny" Lasker, that the deal was in trouble.
After placing orders to sell, Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel, an investment banker at Kidder, Peabody & Co., who was advising on the deal, to confirm these rumors.
Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was and, on hearing that it was Bunny Lasker, responded: "Well, your bunny has a good nose." 

The illegal "tip" of the bunny's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market.
Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced: Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain?
Did Mr. Freeman have notice of this?
Finally, was the information material?
Yet, all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue: Who is and who should be making the criminal law here? 

It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness.
Arguably, both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky.
But even if they behaved recklessly, reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading. 

Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors.
After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor's conduct has always been the common law's method.
When only civil liability is involved, this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization.
Still, case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc (and usually sleazy) examples.
When a court decides that a particular actor's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct, it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule. 

Thus, a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule.
For example, in focusing on Mr. Freeman's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal's collapse, one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin: What if the rumor had been false?
Can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false?
In the past, not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company, but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts.
Today, after Mr. Freeman's plea, there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient. 

In this light, the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear: (1) Before it acts, the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision, not just the immediate parties before the court; and (2) the legislature can frame "bright line" standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts. 

Although legislative lines can result in under-inclusion (which explains why the SEC has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading), judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions.
At least when the stakes are high, uncertainty in turn results in overinclusion, as individuals do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely. 

The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime.
In 1987, the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v.
U.S. to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues.
Yet, late last year, Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of "the intangible right of honest services." At a stroke, this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches (and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee). 

Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem: Congress finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions, which the courts must thereafter interpret, than to engage in the difficult line-drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility.
We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway.
Predictably, when confronted with morally dubious behavior, prosecutors will exploit the latitude such openended statutes give them.
Over the long run, however, sleazy cases will make bad law.

Great American Bank, citing depressed Arizona real estate prices, posted a third-quarter loss of $59.4 million, or $2.48 a share. 

A year earlier, the savings bank had earnings of $8.1 million, or 33 cents a share.
For the nine months, it had a loss of $58.3 million, or $2.44 a share, after earnings of $29.5 million, or $1.20 a share, in the 1988 period. 

Great American said it increased its loan-loss reserves by $93 million after reviewing its loan portfolio, raising its total loan and real estate reserves to $217 million.
Before the loan-loss addition, it said, it had operating profit of $10 million for the quarter.
The move followed a round of similar increases by other lenders against Arizona real estate loans, reflecting a continuing decline in that market. 

In addition to the increased reserve, the savings bank took a special charge of $5 million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters, and it posted a $7.6 million reduction in expected mortgage servicing fees, reflecting the fact that more borrowers are prepaying their mortgages. 

UAL, the hair-trigger stock that exploded Friday's market bombshell, briefly traumatized traders again yesterday. 

Within 10 minutes after an 11:13 a.m. trading halt in UAL, parent of United Airlines, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 27 points to a 60.25-point deficit.
Computer-guided buying then kicked in, and the industrials regained 27 points in five minutes. 

The lightning moves show that the stock market remains fragile and volatile -- ready to jump at the slightest rumor -- a few days after its shocking 190.58-point plunge.
Nervous investors continued to limit their buying to blue-chip stocks while dumping takeover-related issues. 

The industrial average closed down 18.65, to 2638.73.
New York Stock Exchange volume was a heavy 224,070,000 shares.
Decliners on the Big Board outnumbered advancers, 931 to 658. 

UAL was watched closely and traded heavily.
The stock tumbled 24 7/8 to 198 on volume of 2.8 million shares. 

The market is still very touchy about rumors and news on pending takeovers.
UAL, which is trying to reconstruct a buy-out bid that banks wouldn't finance, represents the future of one of the most powerful ingredients in the bull market-corporate restructuring.
An important element of this phenomenon -- the now-shaky market for junk bonds, used often to finance restructurings and takeovers -- continued to cast a pall over stocks. 

"It was a very nervous day," said John Geary, partner of the Big Board specialist firm Ziebarth, Geary. 

The volatility won't end soon.
This Friday brings the "double witching hour," Wall Street's nickname for the monthly simultaneous expiration of a variety of stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.
Traders are already buckling their seat belts.
Previous monthly expirations of the Major Market Index futures and Standard & Poor's 100-stock index options have produced spectacular volatility. 

"We are in one of those phases where you are going to get a lot of volatile expiration action," said Donald Selkin, head of stock-index research at Prudential-Bache Securities. 

Investors were buying yesterday, but they were running scared to premier blue chips such as Procter & Gamble, which jumped 3 3/8 to 127.
Investors "are buying stocks that have predictable earnings," said Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder Peabody. 

Along the way, investors dumped takeover stocks and shares of banks that have leveraged-buy-out debt and risky real estate loans on their books. 

"These loans are more of a focus than lesser-developed-country debt now," said William Bee, senior block trader at Prudential-Bache Securities. 

Chase Manhattan, which sold 14 million additional shares at 40 1/8 Monday through an underwriting group led by Goldman Sachs, closed down 1/8 to 40.
Citicorp fell 1/2 to 32, and Manufacturers Hanover slipped 3/8 to 40 1/4.
Chase and Citicorp's Citibank are involved in the UAL buy-out financing.
Both Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover reported earnings yesterday. 

In the first hour of trading, about one million shares a minute changed hands on the Big Board as big stock-index arbitrage sell programs pushed prices lower. (In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks against offsetting positions in futures.) Traders said many of the sell programs are positions being established ahead of this Friday's expiration. 

Aside from computer-guided selling, airline stocks took a beating as well.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 49.96 to close at 1254.27.
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, continued to retreat in the wake of New York developer Donald Trump's decision to withdraw his $120-a-share takeover bid.
The stock fell 3 1/4 to 73 1/4 on 3.4 million shares.
Delta Air Lines fell 1 7/8 to 67 7/8, USAir Group dropped 3/4 to 40 1/4, Southwest Airlines dipped 1/2 to 25 and Alaska Air Group slid 3/8 to 24 1/4. 

But Texas Air, the owner of Continental and Eastern airlines, bucked the group's decline by rising 7/8 to 14 5/8 in American Stock Exchange trading.
Eastern said it is ahead of schedule in resuming its operations after filing earlier this year for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, from which it expects to emerge early next year. 

Philip Morris, the most active Big Board issue for the second consecutive session, was unchanged at 43 1/4 on 3.9 million shares.
Other blue-chip consumer issues also fared relatively well: PepsiCo rose 1 3/8 to 58 1/2; Coca-Cola Co. was unchanged at 66 3/4; McDonald's also closed unchanged at 30 1/2, and Merck rose 1/2 to 75 1/4. 

Broader averages also fell.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.69 to 341.16, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.88 to 188.89. 

Among the takeover-related stocks that sold off yesterday were Disney, which closed down 2 1/8 to 121 1/4.
Philips Industries tumbled 3/8 to 22 7/8; Hilton Hotels fell 2 1/2 to 92 and Holiday Corp. fell 2 1/8 to 69 7/8. 

Among other blue chips, Exxon gained 1/8 to 45 1/2.
International Paper fell 1 3/8 to 51 1/2, Union Carbide eased 7/8 to 25, Chevron gained 1/8 to 64, and Eastman Kodak closed down 3/4 to 44 1/4. 

The only industry group to show a gain from the industrial average's record high on Oct. 9 is restaurants.
Among the three worst-performing groups, with declines of 10% to 20%, are airlines, casinos and securities brokers. 

Trading also was heavy in the over-the-counter market.
The Nasdaq composite index closed down 1.05 to 459.93 on volume of 161.5 million shares. "The environment is a lot more trading-oriented," said Gary Rosenbach, manager of equity trading at the OTC stock firm Needham & Co. in New York. "Because there is a lot more volatility now, if guys see that they can make a quick 10% or 15% profit, they'll take it." 

Compaq Computer gained 2 1/8 to 103 3/4 on two million shares, reflecting market optimism about the prospects for its newly introduced notebook-sized computer. 

B.F. Goodrich dropped 1 3/8 to 49 1/8.
The company's third-quarter earnings were below both analysts' forecasts and the year-earlier level. 

Blue Arrow added 1/2 to 17 1/4.
The British company plans to change its name to Manpower, the name of its U.S. unit, and write off part of nearly $1.2 billion in good will as a possible prelude to reincorporating in the U.S. 

Dravo rose 5/8 to 16 1/8.
Shearson Lehman Hutton began its coverage of the company with favorable ratings. 

Intertan jumped 2 1/4 to 56 7/8.
The company reported that earnings from operations for the September quarter were up about 25% from a year earlier. 

Bay Financial, which said it may be forced to file under Chapter 11 if it can't reach an agreement with its lenders to relieve its debt burden, plunged 1 3/8 to 2 1/8. 

The Amex Market Value Index fell 1.25 to 375.16.
Volume totaled 16,800,000 shares. 

Among active Amex issues, the American depositary receipts of B.A.T Industries fell 1/4 to 11 3/4 on turnover of 885,800.
Investment bankers and retailers said the turmoil on Wall Street may benefit managers who plan to bid for U.S. retailing units of the British firm because takeover prices may not be as high as before the recent correction. 

Fruit of the Loom slipped 1/8 to 12 3/8 on 501,200 shares.
DWG Corp. jumped 1 1/4 to 15 on 454,100 shares.
Carnival Cruise Lines Class A dropped 1 to 21 1/8 on 331,400 shares. 

Amex issues with big percentage price gains included two Eastern Air Lines preferred stocks, reacting to the news about improved recovery in flight schedules after the company filed for bankruptcy protection.
Eastern's Class F preferred rose 12%, or 1 1/4, to 11 3/4; the Class E preferred gained 7%, or 5/8, to 10 1/4. 

The biggest percentage gainer on the Amex was Enviropact, which jumped 23%, or 5/8, to 3 3/8 on volume of 29,000 shares.
On Monday, the company, a provider of environmental consulting services, reported a wider fiscal fourth-quarter loss and predicted a loss for its fiscal 1990 first quarter, but said a profit is expected for all of fiscal 1990.
But its auditor, Ernst & Young, said Enviropact's financial situation raises "substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern." Mission Resource Partners advanced 8%, or 1 3/8, to 18 7/8.

Corning Inc. posted a 38% decline in third-quarter net income to $76.5 million, or 80 cents a share, from $123.9 million, or $1.37 a share, a year earlier. 

The year-earlier figure included a one-time gain of $59.9 million from the sale of Corning's stakes in Japanese businesses.
Without the gain, operating profit was $64 million, or 71 cents a share. 

The telecommunications, specialty glass, ceramic products and laboratory-services concern said the latest quarter included a tax-loss carry-forward of $600,000.
A year earlier, net included a $700,000 taxlow carry-forward. 

Sales rose 14% to $715 million from $625.4 million. 

Corning's chairman and chief executive officer, James R. Houghton, said operating performance continued to be strong in the telecommunications and health and science segments.
But the specialty-material segment slowed somewhat and consumer products continued below expectations. 

As for joint ventures, Mr. Houghton said profit was "essentially flat" due primarily to a slow recovery at Samsung-Corning Co. in Korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to China.
Also, profit was hurt by the strength of the dollar overseas which negatively affected the company's currency-exchange rate. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Corning closed at $38.50, down 75 cents. 

Cross & Trecker Corp. said it reached an agreement to sell its Wiedemann division to recently created Murata Wiedemann Inc., a U.S. affiliate of Murata Machinery Ltd. of Kyoto, Japan. 

The agreement also includes the purchase of Cross & Trecker's Warner & Swasey (Switzerland) AG unit by a European affiliate of Murata Machinery.
Cross & Trecker is also selling its equity interest in a Japanese joint venture, Murata Warner Swasey, to Murata Machinery. 

Cross & Trecker, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., machine-tool maker, said the net sales price of the total transaction is $24 million.
The Wiedemann division was one of three businesses put up for sale in Cross & Trecker's restructuring program announced in July.
Cross & Trecker said negotiations are under way for the sale of another company, RobertsCorp. 

Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid Nicaragua's Contra rebels, or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles. 

Yet under Mr. Reagan's preferred successor, President Bush, those two cherished national-security causes are withering on the vine.
And, surprisingly, little more than a whimper of protest is being heard, even though Reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative. 

"The programs have arthritis," says Rep. Henry Hyde, a conservative Republican from Illinois.
Yet, he asserts, "you look around . . . and you say, `Who are the leaders?
Who is going to carry the water? '" 

It isn't surprising that President Bush hasn't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI. Though he nominally supports both programs, Mr. Bush hasn't been a passionate champion of either cause, as Mr. Reagan was. 

What's surprising is that there isn't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list.
A combination of factors -- a weariness among some conservatives, a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility. 

Above all, though, conservative Republicans who have championed both the Contras and SDI are reluctant to attack a Republican president for failing to do more -- though that reluctance may be receding. 

"We want to complain, we want to say something about it, and we're going to as it gets worse," says Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican who has been a staunch Contra backer. "But it's like kicking your father in the pants.
You hate to do it because he's your father." Mr. Burton says conservatives' unhappiness with Mr. Bush's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out. 

Of course, neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI. Mr. Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February. 

But the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels.
And the administration's deal with Congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month, though the committees are likely to let aid continue until February. 

Most analysts think there's little prospect the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U.S. arms, and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best.
Instead of focusing on the Contras, Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress -- most recently in a White House meeting yesterday -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua's Sandinista government. 

The administration continues to support SDI, or Star Wars, and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program.
And just last week, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave a strong speech listing "compelling reasons" to push ahead with SDI and saying he'd urge President Bush to veto a defense bill with "inadequate" funding for the program. 

But the strong pitch by Mr. Cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to SDI.
The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding, and in the end the program's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year. 

And while the defense secretary is speaking out, President Bush himself hasn't launched any high-visibility campaign to drum up support, as President Reagan did.
The administration also acknowledges that it isn't pursuing Mr. Reagan's original vision of an "impenetrable shield" protecting the whole U.S., but rather a more modest version. 

More ominous to SDI supporters, the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars.
The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space-based defenses.
But the Soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the U.S. does SDI testing or deployment that the Soviets think violates the existing anti-ballistic-missile treaty. 

It will be hard down the road to persuade Congress to approve money for SDI plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty.
As a result, Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy, charges that the administration's "professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity." 

Still, proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI -- particularly when the public perceives the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev. 

In fact, because communism seems to be beating a global retreat, some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they don't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs. "The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us cannot get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing," says Mitchell Daniels, a former Reagan White House aide who now is president of the Hudson Institute. 

Some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes.
But they say they can't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide. 

One longtime champion of these programs in Congress, Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, is distracted by questions about his ethics, conservatives note.
Other conservative champions, like Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a longtime SDI advocate, don't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan. 

Above all, though, proponents say neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support. "For there to be wind in the sails of any program, the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails," says Rep. Burton. 

All this causes Rep. Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm. 
"What I'd like to see, if he is up to it, is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI," the congressman says. 

Polaroid Corp., benefiting from staff-reduction savings, reported a strong gain in third-quarter operating results and net income of $29.9 million, or 40 cents a share, after preferred-stock requirements. 

Analysts said the numbers were better than expectations, partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency translation.
However, they said the company's flat revenue was a disappointment, and an indication that sales of Polaroid's new conventional film in the U.S. have been sluggish.
Revenue in the third quarter was $437.7 million, almost unchanged from $436.3 million a year earlier. 

Polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $63.1 million for the third quarter, more than double the year-before $24 million.
Charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $54.1 million, or 77 cents a share, in 1988's third quarter. 

"I'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand" for Polaroid products, said Michael Ellmann, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co. "If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue, there isn't a lot here to base optimism on." Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache, says Polaroid officials told him yesterday that U.S. sales of the company's new conventional film product, introduced in the second quarter, have been "disappointing" after a promising start. 

Sam Yanes, a Polaroid spokesman, said "I don't know about disappointing," but added that the company hasn't been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass-merchandise, discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already.
Mr. Yanes said the film, One Film, is currently carried at about 15,000 retail outlets, including drugstores and supermarkets. 

For the nine months, Polaroid reported earnings of $98.5 million, or $1.27 a share.
Last year, the company had a nine-month loss of $15.1 million, or 23 cents a share. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Polaroid closed at $47, up $1.125. 

Arbitragers weren't the only big losers in the collapse of UAL Corp. stock.
Look at what happened to UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, and its chief financial officer, John C. Pope. 

On a day some United Airlines employees wanted Mr. Wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp, Messrs.
Wolf and Pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of UAL, United's parent company, dived $24.875 on the Big Board to close at $198. 

Including Monday's plunge, that has given the two executives paper losses of $49.5 million, based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of UAL gone through at $300 a share. 

When bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week, so did UAL's stock.
Even if the banks resurrect a financing package at $250 a share, the two executives would still get about $25 million less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction. 

Mr. Wolf owns 75,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $83.3125 each.
In the $300-a-share buyout, that totaled about $76.7 million.
By yesterday's close of trading, it was good for a paltry $43.5 million. 

Of course, Mr. Wolf, 48 years old, has some savings.
He left his last two jobs at Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger with combined stock-option gains of about $22 million, and UAL gave him a $15 million bonus when it hired him.
His 1988 salary was $575,000, with a $575,000 bonus. 

The 40-year old Mr. Pope hasn't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to stash away that kind of money.
United paid him a $375,000 bonus to lure him away from American Airlines, and he was paid a salary of $342,122 last year with a $280,000 bonus. 

Mr. Pope owns 10,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $69 each.
That came to a combined $37.7 million under the $300-a-share buy-out, but just $21.3 million at yesterday's close. 

Of the combined $114.4 million the two men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out, they agreed to invest in the buy-out just $15 million, angering many of the thousands of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success. 

United's directors voted themselves, and their spouses, lifetime access to the Friendly Skies -- free first-class travel, and $20,000 a year for life as well.
Conceivably, in a scaled-back buy-out, they could be bumped back to coach seats for life. 

Kay Peterson mounts her bicycle and grinds up yet another steep, rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats.
After a tortuous climb, she is rewarded by a picture-postcard vista: a glade of golden aspens under an azure Indian-summer sky. 

This place is 12 miles into the back country -- a day-long trudge for a hiker, but reached by Ms. Peterson and six others in a mere two hours of pedaling fat-tired mountain bikes. 

"This," says Ms. Peterson, "is what it's all about." 

Twelve hundred miles away, rangers at a Napa County, Calif., state park are among the many who don't quite share the enthusiasm.
This summer, speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the Napa County park, in which a horse -- spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers -- broke its leg.
The animal had to be destroyed; the bikers fled and were never found. 

In numerous parks near San Francisco, rangers have been forced to close trails, set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding.
They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained they were being driven from trails. 

"We were being overrun," says Steve Fiala, trails coordinator of the East Bay Regional Park District.
Two years ago, the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its 65,000 hilly acres. 

From about 200,000 six years ago, the number of mountain bikes in the U.S. is expected to grow to 10 million in 1990.
At least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone.
The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all-terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory. 

Bikers -- many of them ardent environmentalists -- proclaim their sport an efficient, safe, fitness-promoting way to get back to nature, while asserting a right, as taxpayers, to pedal on public lands.
But the bikes' burgeoning numbers, safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas, from the Sierras to the Eastern Seaboard, to ban them from the back country. 

Key to the issue is that the bikes, in skillful hands, can go virtually anywhere, and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror.
An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance.
Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour -- a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians. 

For harried public-land managers across the nation, the response is increasingly to shut the gates.
The state of California, following the lead of some regional parks, recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles.
The move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles. 

Most other states have enacted similar bans.
The bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks.
Even the U.S. Forest Service, whose lenient "multiple-use" philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the U.S., has begun to close some lands to the bikes, including major portions of the popular Pacific Crest Trail, which stretches from California to Canada. 

Often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organizations, the politically potent Sierra Club among them.
Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans.
It has been waging an all-out campaign to beat back a proposal, pushed by Utah bike groups, to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas, where they are now prohibited. 

Yet Sierra's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization, which estimates that 17% of its 500,000 members own mountain bikes.
Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric; it no longer, for example, lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain-marring off-road vehicles. 

But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes won't injure the environment or other users. "I have a mountain bike, yet as a hiker I've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them," says Gene Coan, an official at Sierra's headquarters in San Francisco, echoing the concerns of many members. 

"People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area aren't looking at the whole picture," complains Mark Langton, associate editor of Mountain and City Biking magazine in Canoga Park, Calif. 

Mr. Langton is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers.
He says fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers; many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy. 

To fight back, activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails.
Mr. Langton's group, Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association, mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing.
Biking groups in Montana, Idaho, Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions, says Tim Blumenthal, mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine. 

These groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker's image; in the San Francisco-area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist this summer bikers have formed a volunteer patrol to help rangers enforce regulations, and to school riders in proper trail etiquette. 

Even staunch anti-bike Sierra members concede that 10% of all riders cause most of the problems.
While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations, much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through "education and peer pressure," says Jim Hasenauer, a director of the International Mountain Biking Association. "I think we're making progress." 

Few would have foreseen such a furor when, a decade ago, some Marin County bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires, lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology.
They wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles.
They got a machine more responsive, more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin-tired racing bikes that then were the rage. 

When the bikes first entered mass production in 1981, they were dismissed as a fad.
Last year, 25% of the 10 million bicycles sold in the U.S. were mountain bikes.
In California, a bellwether market, they accounted for more than 80% of all bike sales.
The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country.
City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic, bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes. 

Crested Butte, population 1,200, is a bastion of the sport.
By one estimate, everyone here under 50 owns at least one bike.
The town is home to the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and it hosts the annual Fat Tire Bike Week.
This summer, the jamboree attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town's winter ski season. 

David Lindsey, chairman of the Fat Tire Bike celebration, muses that the bike's popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia. "The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the `paperboy' bike you had as a kid, but it can do so much more," he says. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., fulfilling its dismal earnings forecast for 1989, said its third-quarter net income fell 68% on flat revenue. 

Stung by higher marketing costs and slowing volume growth, the giant Coke bottling operation said net fell to $12.7 million, or six cents a share, from $39.9 million, or 26 cents a share, the year earlier.
The results met estimates of analysts, who had already slashed their projections after the company said in late August that its 1989 earnings could tumble as much as 37%.
A company spokesman said yesterday that Coca-Cola Enterprises sticks by its 1989 forecast. 

Third-quarter revenue was flat at $1.02 billion.
The year-ago results, however, included the operations of a bottling business, which was sold last December. 

Excluding that bottling business, Coca-Cola Enterprises' volume, measured by cases of soda, rose only 1%.
The volume is well below the industry's 4% to 5% growth rate of recent years, but in line with other soft-drink companies for the third quarter.
The latest third-quarter volume also compares with a very strong 10% growth in the year-ago quarter. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises blamed the lower volume on its soft-drink prices, which were about 3% higher in the third quarter.
Consumers have been accustomed to buying soft-drinks at discounted prices for several years.
Coca-Cola Enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping.
The company said it expects consumers will adjust to higher-priced soft drinks. 

A spokesman attributed the bulk of a 14% increase in selling, administrative and general expenses -- to $324.9 million -- to marketing costs. "They're out there promoting like crazy, trying to get prices up by promotion," said Roy Burry, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co. 

For the nine months, Coca-Cola Enterprises' net fell 31% to $65 million, or 39 cents a share, from $93.8 million, or 63 cents a share.
Revenue was flat at about $2.97 billion. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co., also said it repurchased about 1.2 million of its common shares during the third quarter.
The buy-back is part of a 25-million-share repurchase plan, under which Coca-Cola Enterprises so far has acquired a total of 9.7 million shares. 

Separately, Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc., as expected, said fiscal third-quarter net rose 11% to $269.3 million, or $1.02 a share, from $241.6 million, or 91 cents a share.
Sales rose 25% to $3.90 billion from $3.13 billion.
The year-ago quarter's results include an after-tax charge of $5.9 million from the sale of a winery in Spain. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Coca-Cola Enterprises closed at $16.375 a share, down 62.5 cents.
PepsiCo closed at $58.50 a share, up $1.375. 

When Maj. Moises Giroldi, the leader of the abortive coup in Panama, was buried, his body bore several gunshot wounds, a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs.
They were the signature of his adversary, Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega. 

The rebel officer's slow and painful death, at the headquarters of Panama's Battalion-2000 squad, was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega, says a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports.
Leaping into rages, sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust, Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup, according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City. 

He is now changing the place he sleeps every night, sometimes more than once a night.
His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full-time mistress, Vicky Amado, and her mother, Norma.
And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters.
More enemies to be dealt with. 

In the two weeks since the rebellion, which the U.S. hesitantly backed, Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal-and efficient-in maintaining power.
Yet, while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment, it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades.
America's war on the dictator over the past two years, following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988, is the legacy of that relationship.
Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega, it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama's long history of conspirators and pirates. 

For most of the past 30 years, the marriage was one of convenience.
In 1960, for example, when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute, according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period.
The woman had nearly died.
But U.S. intelligence, rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy, merely filed the report away.
Mr. Noriega's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests.
From that point on, the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian's misadventures. 

The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators, but none quite so resourceful.
The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega isn't as smooth as the shah of Iran, as well-born as Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti's Baby Doc Duvalier.
Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them.
And out of necessity: The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power, but a single error on his part could cost him his life. 

"The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along," says Ambler Moss, a former Ambassador to Panama. "He has mastered the art of survival." 

In keeping with America's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega, recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival.
Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama's dire economic situation, says Mr. Moss, but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression, and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement. 

"If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing, he might not have made it through 1988," Mr. Moss contends. 

Perhaps most important, Mr. Noriega's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases, to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne.
One Colombian drug boss, upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile, sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name. 

"He is cornered," says the Rev. Fernando Guardia, who has led Catholic Church opposition against Noriega. "The Americans have left him without a way out.
It is easy to fight when you don't have any other option." 

His chief advantage in the fight: his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses.
Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos, who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation. 

The U.S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late 1959, when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima, according to former U.S. intelligence officials.
The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega's half-brother, a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado.
Luis Carlos, knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer, relayed Tony's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and, more important, among his officers and instructors.
A spy was born. 

It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega, who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina -- pineapple face.
Born the illegitimate son of his father's maid, he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City.
Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets, and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate.
He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers, many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well-off families to the highly disciplined, French-modeled academy as a sort of reform school. 

In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed, French-made uniform, Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life, friends from the period say. "He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism, where officers were the elite with special privileges," recalls Darien Ayala, a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend. 

Mr. Noriega's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967, intelligence officials say.
His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison, Major Omar Torrijos, gave him an intriguing assignment: Mr. Noriega would organize the province's first intelligence service. 

The spy network would serve two clients: the Panamanian government, by monitoring political opponents in the region, and the U.S., by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co. 's banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles.
United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama's national income.
Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader. 

Mr. Noriega's initial retainer was only $50 to $100 a month, plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX, a former intelligence official says.
It was modest pay by American standards, but a healthy boost to his small military salary, which fellow officers remember as having been $300 to $400 monthly. 

"He did it very well," recalls Boris Martinez, a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation. "He started building the files that helped him gain power." 

A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City, capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy.
By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses, he gained a ready cache of information.
He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk, which had been found with their mistresses. 

This proved particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in 1967, when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared could turn violent.
Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy.
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles, which was ruled by United Fruit Co.
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control. 

"It was like a play on Broadway," recalls Mr. Martinez. "Noriega managed the whole thing.
He was superb.
Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people." 

During his years in Chiriqui, however, Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious.
Rodrigo Miranda, a local lawyer and human-rights monitor, recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David, where he had his offices.
Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked, laughing at them and then retreating to his office. "People started wondering if something was wrong with him," Mr. Miranda recalls. 

But through this period, so far as the U.S. military was concerned, Mr. Noriega was a model recruit.
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967, according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret.
He flew to Fort Bragg, N.C., in September of that year for a course in psychological operations, returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called "military intelligence for officers." 

Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty, but they did so falsely.
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier.
He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets.
Mr. Noriega, by now a lieutenant colonel, expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis, the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking.
When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega's moonlighting, intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans. 

"Early on in the State Department, we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel, in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States," recalls Francis J. McNeil, who, as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977. "Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans." 

Even at this early stage, drugs caused additional concerns.
During the Nixon administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2's connections to arrested drug traffickers.
One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega, one of which was assassination. 

The head of the DEA at the time, John Ingersoll, scotched the assassination plan.
But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials, including Mr. Noriega.
Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S. "Everybody was afraid of him," Mr. Ingersoll says. 

Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976, when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army's 470th Military Intelligence Group.
The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos's own phone, according to American intelligence officials. 

"We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar," says former CIA Director Stansfield Turner. 

For the first time, the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense, Mr. Turner says. "In the world of intelligence, if you want to get information, you get it from seedy characters.
The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you." 

Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others.
Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration. 

The U.S. soon found new cause for concern: gun-running.
Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza.
They included one of Mr. Noriega's closest friends and business partners, Carlos Wittgreen.
And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. Noriega himself. 

At the time, though, in 1979, the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy.
Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon.
Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to fly through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.
It was a Friday in June. 

The Pentagon foiled the plan.
According to military officers at the time, word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting.
On Monday, U.S. officials received a routine, unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama. "Due to health reasons, Lt. Col. Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington," it read. 

Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback.
Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen, the friend of Mr. Noriega, and the other four was dismissed on a technicality.
But now, along with reindicting Mr. Noriega's pal, they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself, on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $2 million in arms. 

In January 1980, Jerome Sanford, as assistant U.S. attorney, was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Miami.
Panamanian dictator Torrijos, he was told, had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington.
Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega's friend, Mr. Wittgreen, would be handling the shah's security.
It wouldn't be a good idea to indict him -- much less Mr. Noriega, the prosecutor was told. 

After prodding from Mr. Sanford, U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed. "Unfortunately," Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter, "those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control." The letter, along with a detailed prosecution memo, sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death. 

"I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we wouldn't have the problems we have now," Mr. Sanford says. "If he had been found guilty, we could have stopped him." 

In August 1983, Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama, having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos.
Soon, the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses.
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll.
Payments averaged nearly $200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA. 

Although working for U.S. intelligence, Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively.
During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas.
He allegedly entered into Panama's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses, according to Floyd Carlton, a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges. 

But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House wouldn't act against him, recalls his close ally Jose Blandon, because he had an insurance policy: his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama.
Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua.
And on at least one occasion, in the spring of 1985, he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua.
Although, his help for the Contra cause was limited, it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration, says Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee. "Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin," he says. 

An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington -- by compromising U.S. officials.
Curtin Windsor, then the ambassador to Costa Rica, recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and "quiet, serious conversation" on the Aswara Peninsula.
Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, of the invitation. "Briggs screamed," Mr. Windsor recalls.
He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a "honey trap," in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event "with sound and video." Mr. Briggs, on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council, couldn't be reached for comment. 

As Mr. Noriega's political troubles grew, so did his offers of assistance to the Contras, an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington.
For instance, he helped steal the May 1984 Panamanian elections for the ruling party.
But just one month later, he also contributed $100,000 to a Contra leader, according to documents released for Oliver North's criminal trial in Washington, D.C. 

Yet, his political setbacks mounted.
Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora, his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges.
He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta, a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S., after Mr. Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder.
And, all the while, Panama's debt problems continued to grow.
Mr. Noriega was growing desperate. 

In late 1986, he made an offer he thought the U.S. couldn't refuse.
As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the North trial, Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in exchange "for a promise to help clean up Noriega's image and a commitment to lift the {U.S.} ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces." 

"North," the document went on, referring to Oliver North, "has told Noriega's representative that U.S. law forbade such actions.
The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things, just as Noriega had helped {the U.S.} the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal." 

Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams, who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz.
Mr. Noriega's proposal was turned down.
And Mr. Shultz curtly told Mr. Abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image. 

The end of the marriage was at hand.
Within weeks the unfolding Iran-Contra scandal took away Mr. Noriega's insurance policy.
The death of CIA Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence.
Public protests against him were triggered in June 1987 due to charges by Diaz Herrera, his former chief of staff, that Mr. Noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs.
Spadafora and Torrijos.
Few American officials were willing any longer to defend him. 

Lawyers in Miami -- this time working virtually without impediment -- prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in February 1988.
During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for his resignation, Mr. Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans, whom he had helped for so many years, could turn against him. 

Now, neither side -- the U.S. nor Mr. Noriega -- has an easy out.
President Bush has sworn to bring him to justice.
Mr. Noriega believes he hasn't any alternative but to continue clutching to power.
It is a knock-out battle -- perhaps to the death. 

In the end, is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein's monster, created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power?
Not quite, Sen. Leahy contends. 

"For short-term gains, people were willing to put up with him.
That allowed him to get stronger and stronger," he says. "I don't think we created him as much as we fed him, nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong." 

Parsow Partnership Ltd. and Elkhorn Partners L.P. said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of CACI International Inc. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Parsow and Elkhorn, which together hold 8.685% of CACI's common shares, said they think it is in the best interest of CACI stockholders that the company be sold. 

CACI, based in Arlington, Va., said it hadn't seen the filing by Parsow and Elkhorn and therefore had no comment. 

The partnerships said they may seek board representation, and they may seek the support of CACI's board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans. 

According to the filing, Parsow and Elkhorn are based in Elkhorn, Neb., and are controlled by the same general partner, Alan S. Parsow. 

Their combined stake consists of 880,500 CACI common shares, including 86,500 shares bought in the past 60 days at $2.3125 to $2.4375 a share.
Additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise, depending on market conditions and other factors. 

Moody's Investors Service Inc., fretting about increasing competitive pressure on Ryder, placed about $2.8 billion in company securities under review for possible downgrade.
Ratings under review are Ryder's A-1 collateral trust debentures, A-2 senior notes and bonds, A-2 preferred stock and the company's Prime-1 rating for commercial paper.
Moody's said it is assessing the strategies Ryder's management may follow in addressing significant challenges in some major markets.
The rating agency said it is focusing especially on the transportation service company's efforts to control costs, improve margins and enhance its competitive position in its primary business, vehicle leasing and rental. 

Three leading drug companies reported robust third-quarter earnings, bolstered by strong sales of newer, big-selling prescriptions drugs that provide hefty profit margins. 

Merck & Co. reported a 25% increase in earnings; Warner-Lambert Co. 's profit rose 22% and Eli Lilly & Co. 's net income rose 24%.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations. 

Merck & Co. 

Merck, Rahway, N.J., continued to lead the industry with a strong sales performance in the human and animal health-products segment.
A stronger U.S. dollar reduced third-quarter and first-nine-month sales growth 2% and 3%, respectively.
International sales accounted for 47% of total company sales for the nine months, compared with 50% a year earlier.
Sales for the quarter rose to $1.63 billion from $1.47 billion. 

Mevacor, Merck's new cholesterol-lowering drug, had higher sales than any other prescription medicine has ever achieved in the U.S. in the year following introduction, the company said.
The drug was introduced in West Germany this year.
Intense competition, however, led to unit sales declines for a group of Merck's established human and animal-health products, including Aldomet and Indocin. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Merck shares closed at $75.25, up 50 cents. 

Warner-Lambert Co. 

Warner-Lambert, Morris Plains, N.J., reported sales that were a record for any quarter and the eighth quarter in a row of 20% or more per-share earnings growth.
Spurred by growth in world-wide sales of the company's prescription drugs, Warner-Lambert said 1989 will be the best year in its history, with per-share earnings expected to increase more than 20% to about $6.10.
Sales for the quarter rose to $1.11 billion from $1.03 billion. 

Prescription-drug world-wide sales rose 9% in the quarter to $340 million; U.S. sales rose 15%.
The segment's growth was led by sales of the cardiovascular drugs Lopid, a lipid regulator, and Dilzem, a calcium channel blocker. 

World-wide sales of Warner-Lambert's non-prescription health-care products, such as Halls cough tablets, Rolaids antacid, and Lubriderm skin lotion, increased 3% to $362 million in the third quarter; U.S. sales rose 5%. 

Confectionery products sales also had strong growth in the quarter.
World-wide sales of Trident gum, Certs breath mints, and Clorets gum and breath mints, increased 12% to $277 million. 

Warner-Lambert shares closed at $109.50 a share, up $1.50, in Big Board composite trading yesterday. 

Eli Lilly & Co. 

Lilly attributed record third-quarter and nine-month results to world-wide gains for pharmaceuticals, medical instruments and plant-science products despite poor exchange rates for the dollar that slowed sales abroad. 

Earnings continued to pace sales because of a lower tax rate, profit from the renegotiation of the debt instrument received from Faberge Inc. in connection with Lilly's sale of Elizabeth Arden Inc. in 1987, and net proceeds from the settlement of patent litigation at Lilly's Hybritech Inc. unit. 

Third-quarter sales of the Indianapolis, Ind., company rose 11% to $1.045 billion from $940.6 million.
Nine-month sales grew 12% to $3.39 billion from $3.03 billion a year earlier. 

Sales of Prozac, an anti-depressant, led drug-sales increases.
Higher sales of pesticides and other plant-science products more than offset a slight decline in the sales of animal-health products to fuel the increase in world-wide agricultural product sales, Lilly said. 

Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc. and Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. units led growth in the medical-instrument systems division. 

Lilly shares closed yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board at $62.25, down 12.5 cents. 

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe, which is to be launched today. 

Charles Redmond, a NASA spokesman, said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today.
Although the network isn't connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle, part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn. 

Mr. Redmond said the intruder hadn't yet done any harm but the agency feared "garbage data could be substituted for real data." He estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system. 

The intruder, among the broadest yet to hit a research network, appeared to affect only Digital Equipment Corp. hardware that uses Digital's VAX/VMS operating system.
It is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that last year infected Arpanet, a much larger network used by researchers at universities, laboratories and government agencies around the world. 

In the lingo of computer security, the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm, Mr. Redmond said.
A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks.
The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA's Space Physics Analysis Network, Mr. Redmond said. 

NASA said the Galileo worm hadn't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms.
But Mr. Redmond said the worm hit universities that hadn't elected to make the changes. 

Michael Alexander, a senior editor at Computerworld, a trade publication, said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the user's name.
If it finds one and gets into the system, it will display a screen when a user logs on that says, "Worms Against Nuclear Killers. . . . You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war." 

In addition, Mr. Alexander said, the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center -- such as, "George Orwell was an optimist," or "Don't feed the bats tonight." 

The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user.
The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running.
If it finds one of those passwords, Mr. Alexander said, the worm will do such things as change users' passwords to a series of random numbers, preventing them from signing on to the network. 

NASA estimated that, on Monday, about four computer centers were affected.
Yesterday, the number grew to 40; today the number is expected to grow to 100.
NASA said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the 6,000 connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage, if any. 

Anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft.
Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying Galileo into orbit should explode, or if Galileo itself crashes into the Earth during the two times it flies close to the planet, fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere. 

So far Galileo has been delayed twice, once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space-shuttle engine, and yesterday because of the weather.
NASA said the Galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay. 

Mr. Alexander of Computerworld said hackers have gone after SPAN before.
He said the Chaos Computer Club, of West Germany, once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi, messing up some calculations. 

Robin Honiss, president and chief executive officer of this bank holding company, was elected to the additional posts of chairman, president and chief executive of the company's New England Savings Bank subsidiary.
William R. Attridge resigned those posts, as well as a seat on NESB's board.
NESB is also the parent of Omnibank. 

Boeing Co., already struck by its Machinists union, briefly called off contract talks with its engineers and labeled their demands "grossly excessive." 

Later, however, the company agreed to meet on Monday with the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association after a federal mediator intervened, according to the union. 

A spokesman for the engineers said the company asked the union to reduce its demands, which included a 19% pay hike in the first year and 8% in the second and third years.
The union represents about 28,000 engineers and technical workers.
Its contract expires Dec. 1. 

Meanwhile, a federal mediator is scheduled to meet today with Boeing officials and representatives of 55,000 striking Machinists. 

"It will take several meetings to resolve this," said a spokesman for the Machinists union. "We don't want to bring back something the members will reject." Machinists already have rejected a package that would have provided a 10% pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract.
It also would have reduced mandatory overtime. 

National Semiconductor Corp. said it settled a four-year-old patent infringement case against Linear Technology Corp. by accepting a $3 million payment from Linear in exchange for granting Linear irrevocable licenses for all products involved.
The two companies also agreed to settle any future property rights issues over the next 10 years through binding arbitration, both companies said. 

The products are so-called analog integrated circuits that have applications in the consumer electronics, automobile and electronic instrumentation markets.
Linear Technology, Milpitas, Calif., called the settlement "positive," since products covered by the disputed patents account for about 20% of its annual sales. 

The electronics concern said it already has paid $2 million of the settlement to National Semiconductor, Santa Clara, Calif., and will pay the remaining $1 million in equal installments over the next eight quarters.
The payments aren't expected to have an impact on coming operating results, Linear added. 

Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge. 

Upjohn officials said they couldn't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees, and how many, will participate in the retirement plan.
But the pharmaceutical company said it "anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan's implementation will more than offset short-term costs." 

The program, available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older, could increase an individual's retirement benefits 10% to 20%.
In addition, Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay. 

Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and "an effective headcount-control program." 

But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have, because few jobs will end up being eliminated. "It's a cosmetic move," said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co. 

According to Upjohn's estimates, only 50% to 60% of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan.
Upjohn further estimated that about 50% of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced.
As a result, Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $38.875 apiece. 

An Upjohn spokesman said he had "heard nothing" to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company, which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation.
The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors. 

The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy.
Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs, the spokesman said. 

Dell Computer Corp. said it cut prices on several of its personal computer lines by 5% to 17%. 

The Austin, Texas-based company, which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories, said its price cuts include a $100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory, a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor.
That package now sells for about $2,099.
A computer using the more-advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor, with four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte hard disk now sells for $5,699, down from $6,799. 

Personal computer prices for models using the Intel 286 and 386 microprocessors, which the Dell models use, generally have been coming down as chip prices have fallen. 

Intelogic Trace Inc., San Antonio, Texas, said it bought 2.7 million shares, or about 18%, of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $3.625 a share, or $9.9 million. 

The move boosts Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelman's stake to 20% from 16.2% and may help prevent Martin Ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern.
Mr. Ackerman already is seeking to oust Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp., an Intelogic affiliate. 

The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives "to maximize shareholder value," including the possible sale of the company. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $2.75. 

Mr. Edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves, saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when "the company is on a roll." He added, "This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed, particularly, to take the company private." 

But Mr. Ackerman said the buy-back, and the above-market price paid, prove that Mr. Edelman is running scared. 

Wall Street's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered. 

The reason: Risks from the firms' new "merchant banking" activities are rising as revenue from the industry's traditional business erodes. 

The downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc., parent of First Boston Corp., by Moody's Investors Service Inc., coupled with a Moody's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade, sent shivers through the brokerage community this week.
With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably. 

Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs, which they sell to finance their daily operations.
The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper. 

But Moody's warned that Shearson's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon, a move that would reduce Shearson's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms.
Shearson is 62%-owned by American Express Co. 

"Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business, so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s," says Christopher T. Mahoney, a Moody's vice president. "A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible." Standard & Poor's Corp. says First Boston, Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., in particular, are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead. 

What worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings.
That's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors.
Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly, Wall Street's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years. 

"The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays" in getting their money back, says Jeffrey Bowman, a vice president at S&P, which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston. 

"Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation," says Mr. Mahoney of Moody's.
Merchant banking, where firms commit their own money, "is getting riskier, and there's less of it to go around." In addition, he says, the buy-out business is under pressure "because of the junk bond collapse," meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks. 

In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing, with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sales of its assets. 

In a recent report, Moody's said it "expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry, which, combined with overcapacity, will create poor prospects for profitability." It said that the "temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor." 

Both Moody's and S&P cited First Boston's reliance in recent years on merchant banking, which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm's profit.
The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp., First Boston's most lucrative client of the decade, is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $3 billion of high-yield, high-risk junk financings for Campeau units.
In addition, a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co. wasn't repaid on time when its $450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn. 

"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston's equity," Moody's said. "Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm's equity." CS First Boston, however, benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder, Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank. 

Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business.
But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail, or individual investor, business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash.
In addition, Shearson's listed $2 billion of capital is overstated, according to the rating concerns, because it includes $1.7 billion of goodwill.
Shearson "really only has $300 million of capital," says Mr. Bowman of S&P. 

A Shearson spokesman said the firm isn't worried. "A year ago, Moody's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade," he said. "After two months of talks, our rating was maintained." Drexel, meanwhile, already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating. 

The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel, the leading underwriter in that market.
The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal.
Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business, cutting the firm's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000. 

Recently, Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years.
The firm's capital, moreover, hasn't grown at the same rate as in the past, officials at these firms say. 

Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness. "We're well positioned with $1.7 billion of capital," a Drexel spokesman said. "And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm, the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view.
Moreover, we've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs, which are down around 40% over the last six months." 

Travelers Corp. 's third-quarter net income rose 11%, even though claims stemming from Hurricane Hugo reduced results $40 million. 

Net advanced to $94.2 million, or 89 cents a share, from $85 million, or 83 cents a share, including net realized investment gains of $31 million, up from $10 million a year ago.
But revenue declined to $3 billion from $3.2 billion. 

Travelers estimated that the California earthquake last month will result in a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of less than $10 million. 

The insurer's earnings from commercial property/casualty lines fell 59% in the latest quarter, while it lost $7.2 million in its personal property/casualty business, compared with earnings of $6.1 million a year ago. 

Travelers's employee benefits group, which includes its group health insurance operations, posted earnings of $24 million, compared with a loss of $3 million last year. 

In the first nine months, net was $306 million, compared with a loss of $195 million in the 1988 period.
The year-ago results included a $415 million charge in the 1988 second quarter for underperforming real estate and mortgage loans. 

Metallgesellschaft AG said it agreed to acquire 51% of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Metallgesellschaft, a diversified Frankfurt, West Germany-based metals group, said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants.
Lentjes' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b.
H. plant engineering unit, the company said. 

The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading, processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units, the company said. 

Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks ($434.4 million) and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks. 

The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock.
A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices. 

Komatsu Ltd., a large integrated maker of construction machinery, posted a 32% unconsolidated gain in first-half pretax profit.
For the period ended Sept.30, it earned 16.68 billion yen, (US$116.7 million) up from 12.68 billion yen the year before. 

Sales rose 11% to 292.32 billion yen from 263.07 billion yen.
Net income surged 31% to 7.63 billion yen from 5.82 billion yen.
Per-share net rose to 7.84 yen from 6.53 yen. 

Brisk domestic demand due to increasing capital investment pushed up sales sharply in construction and industrial machinery divisions. 

Domestic sales of construction machinery, such as power shovels and bulldozers rose to 142.84 billion yen from 126.15 billion yen.
Demand from Europe and Southeast Asia also grew, but due to increasing production at local plants, overseas sales edged down 2.8%. 

Komatsu predicted that for the fiscal year ending March 31 sales will climb to 600 billion yen from 566.54 billion yen; pretax profit was forecast at 35 billion yen, up from 28.53 billion yen in fiscal 1989.
Net is expected to rise to 17 billion yen from 12.82 billion yen a year earlier. 

Heritage Media Corp., New York, said it offered to buy the shares of POP Radio Corp. it doesn't already own in a stock swap. 

Heritage, which owns 51% of POP's 3.6 million shares outstanding, said it will exchange one share of a new preferred stock for each POP common share it doesn't already own.
Depending upon how many warrants and options are exercised prior to completion of the transaction, Heritage would issue between 1.8 million and 2.35 million preferred shares, a Heritage spokesman estimated.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, POP plunged $4 to $14.75. 

The preferred stock, which would have a dividend rate of $1.76 a year, would be convertible into Heritage common at a rate of four common shares for each preferred.
New York-based POP Radio provides, through a national, in-store network, a customized music, information and advertising service which simulates live radio.
Heritage owns and operates television and radio stations and in-store advertising and promotion programs. 

ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars (US$148.9 million to $153.3 million) through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares.
Perpetual preferred shares aren't retractable by the holders, the company said.
Rogers said the shares will be convertible into Class B shares, but that the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place.
A spokesman for the Toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said the coupon rate hasn't yet been fixed, but will probably be set at around 8%.
He declined to discuss other terms of the issue. 

World sugar futures prices soared on rumors that Brazil, a major grower and exporter, might not ship sugar this crop year and next. 

Prices also were boosted by another rumor that Mexico, usually a large producer and exporter, might have to buy a large quantity of sugar. 

Although traders rushed to buy futures contracts, many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development, which couldn't be confirmed, analysts said. 

The March and May contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day.
The March delivery, which has no limits, settled at 14.53 cents, up 0.56 cent a pound.
The May contract, which also is without restraints, ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents.
The July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents, while other contract months showed near-limit advances. 

According to reports carried by various news services, the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they won't be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season, which began May 1, and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel. 

One analyst, Arthur Stevenson, of Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, estimated that 65% or more of Brazil's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and can't use gasoline. "This is a demand that must be met, regardless of the price of oil," said Mr. Stevenson. 

Brazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world.
A shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected, but the latest news, if true, indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated. 

During the current crop year, Brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar, a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89.
Its 1989-90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in 

"It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year," explained Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. "Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued" yesterday. 

As a result, Ms. Ganes said, it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet, even though the crop year is six months old.
More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production, according to Ms. Ganes.
Also, there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane, and this change is being felt now, she said. 

Most important, Ms. Ganes noted, "Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports." 

Thomas Oxnard, sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack, N.J., said: "I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports, particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound." 

Above all, Mr. Oxnard noted, the situation is extremely confused. "Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation," he said. "It's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out, such as the one saying exports will be suspended, and no one can confirm it." 

Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated.
On the one hand, Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program. 

"It has to weigh, on the other hand, the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol," Mr. Oxnard said. 

Mexico, which is normally a sugar exporter, has had production problems in the past two years, analysts said.
Last year, it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments, they noted.
This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs, analysts said. 

In other commodity markets yesterday: 

ENERGY: Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon.
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged.
But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil.
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $20.07.
The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute, which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel. 

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come.
Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints' Day across much of Europe.
Continued export demand also supported prices.
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S., market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government, which often buys U.S. grains in quantity, turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat.
Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S.
That designation would, among other things, provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain.
The Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies, despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October. 

COPPER: Futures prices rose, extending Tuesday's gains.
The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $1.1650.
Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session, and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began, an analyst said.
According to news service reports, most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5% increase and other benefits.
However, some workers haven't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations, the analyst said.
Separately, Reuter reported that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich Bougainville Island for two months.
The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who want Bougainville to secede from Papua-New Guinea. 

GenCorp Inc., hurt by a plant accident and other unexpected costs, said it expects to report that fiscal fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations will be significantly below last year's $25 million. 

The Fairlawn, Ohio-based company also said that full-year profit from continuing operations will be far below last year's $148 million. 

Last year's figures include a one-time loss of $12 million for restructuring and unusual items. 

But the automotive parts and aerospace concern expects that net for the year ending Nov. 30 will exceed last fiscal year's net of $70 million, or $2.19 a share, primarily because of $200 million in gains from sales of discontinued operations. 

Harry Millis, an analyst at McDonald & Co. in Cleveland, said GenCorp's unanticipated losses come largely from an accident at a government-owned assembly plant in Kansas, run by a private subcontractor, that makes cluster bombs for GenCorp's Aerojet Ordnance business. 

Transamerica Corp., San Francisco, said third-quarter profit was essentially flat despite a large one-time gain a year earlier. 

The insurance and financial services concern said profit for the quarter rose 1.1% to $93.9 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with $92.9 million, or $1.18 a share, the year earlier.
The results reflected a 24% gain in income from its finance businesses, and a 15% slide in income from insurance operations. 

Transamerica said third-quarter investment gains were $10.2 million, compared with $6.4 million the year earlier.
It said insurance profit reflected a $6 million loss from Hurricane Hugo.
It also estimated that losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California would be no more than $6 million, and would be included in fourth-quarter results. 

Although his team lost the World Series, San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them.
He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park.
Small wonder, since he's asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $100 million into the new stadium.
As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One, opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium. 

A stadium craze is sweeping the country.
It's fueled by the increasing profitability of major-league teams.
Something like one-third of the nation's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums, ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg. 

Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city.
Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that.
He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out.
Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community, not create more of it. 

Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium.
San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago.
Last month, Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $100 million stadium bond and tax proposition.
Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, the major media -- and spent $100,000 on promotion.
But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself, and rejected it 59% to 41%. 

In San Francisco, its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls.
George Christopher, the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s, won't endorse the new ballpark.
He says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces.
Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces, Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal "games" of their own with the voters. 

Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built.
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees, and he can prove it.
Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl, and instead built his own $100 million coliseum with private funds.
He didn't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit. "This stadium shows that anything government can do, we can do better," Mr. Robbie says. 

But to Moon Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city's cavernous, money-losing Superdome, questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance. "The Superdome is an exercise in optimism, a statement of faith," he has said. "It is the very building of it that is important, not how much of it is used or its economics." 

An Egyptian Pharaoh couldn't have justified his pyramids any better.
But civilization has moved forward since then.
Today taxpayers get to vote, most of the time, on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs, or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions. 

Ralston Purina Co. reported a 47% decline in fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market. 

The St. Louis company earned $45.2 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $84.9 million, or $1.24 a share, a year earlier.
Sales in the latest period were $1.76 billion, a 13% increase from last year's $1.55 billion. 

For the year ended Sept. 30, Ralston earned $422.5 million, or $6.44 a share, up 8.9% from $387.8 million, or $5.63 a share.
This year's results included a gain of $70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations.
Sales for the full year were $6.6 billion, up 13% from $5.8 billion. 

Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville, N.C., the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company.
The battery plant, which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products, will be closed over the next year or so, a spokesman said. 

Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures, which required higher advertising spending.
For the year, pet food volume was flat, the company said. 

Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases, but also spent more on promotion.
The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales, it added. 

Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America. 

Ralston shares closed yesterday at $80.50, off $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said it will convert its Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners Ltd. partnership into a publicly traded company through the exchange of units of the partnership for common shares.
The company said the restructuring isn't expected to have any impact, adverse or otherwise, on its financial results. 

Freeport-McMoRan, a New Orleans-based diversified energy conglomerate, said the partnership will exchange its assets for common shares of a yet-to-be-formed entity.
Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners will be liquidated and shares of the new company distributed to the partnership's unitholders. 

Unitholders will receive two additional 55 cents-a-unit distribution payments before the trust is liquidated in early 1990, the company said.
It is expected that common shares equal to the number of units outstanding -- about 108 million on Sept. 30 -- will be issued during the first quarter of 1990.

ORTEGA ENDED a truce with the Contras and said elections were threatened. 

The Nicaraguan president, citing attacks by the U.S.-backed rebels, suspended a 19-month-old cease-fire and accused Bush of "promoting death." While he reaffirmed support for the country's Feb. 25 elections, Ortega indicated that renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras could thwart the balloting.
He said U.S. assistance should be used to demobilize the rebels.
A White House spokesman condemned the truce suspension as "deplorable" but brushed off talk of renewing military funding for the insurgents. 

The Contra military command, in a statement from Honduras, said Sandinista troops had launched a major offensive against the rebel forces. 

East German leader Krenz called the protests in his country a "good sign," saying that many of those marching for democratic freedoms were showing support for "the renovation for socialism."

Died: James A. Attwood, 62, retired chairman and president of Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York, Tuesday, in New York City, of an acute anemic condition. 

Xerox Corp. has told employees in its Crum & Forster personal insurance operations that it is laying off about 300 people, or 25% of the staff. 

A spokeswoman for Crum & Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move. 

She said the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $4 million to be spread over the next three quarters.
By comparison, for the first nine months, Xerox earned $492 million, or $4.55 a share, on revenue of $12.97 billion. 

Earnings at Xerox's financial-services operations actually rose slightly, but that was largely because capital gains at Crum & Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments. 

Property/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters, as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake have resulted in huge payments. 

First Chicago Corp. said it completed its $55.1 million cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp., another Chicago bank holding company. 

If you'd really rather have a Buick, don't leave home without the American Express card. 

Or so the slogan might go.
American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card. 

The companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card.
They have begun sending letters explaining the program, which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18, to about five million card holders.
Neither company would disclose the program's cost. 

Buick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a "good credit history" and are "good at making payments," says a spokeswoman for the division.
American Express also represents the upscale image "we're trying to project," she adds. 

Buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as "the doctor's car" -- a product for upscale professionals.
Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier, though industry sales fell.
But since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1, Buick sales have plunged 33%. 

For American Express, the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales, where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business.
Traditionally, the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses. 

Phillip Riese, an American Express executive vice president, says the promotion with Buick is his company's first with an auto maker, but "hopefully {will be} the first of many" in the company's effort to promote its green card as "the total car-care card." To that end, American Express has been signing up gasoline companies, car repair shops, tire companies and car dealers to accept the card. 

Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card, but few card holders realize this, Mr. Riese says. 

Until now, however, buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. couldn't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates, says a spokesman for the GM finance arm.
But GMAC approved the Buick program, he says, because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing, and so doesn't carry any finance rates. 

Mr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick "very sophisticated direct-mail marketers," so "by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability." In addition, Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders, says an American Express spokeswoman.
When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases, Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars, the spokeswoman says. 

American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S., and over half have the green card.
GMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $45,000 who hadn't "missed any payments," the Buick spokeswoman says.
Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC.
These 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC's advertised finance rates, which start at 6.9% for two-year loan contracts. 

A spokesman for Visa International's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards, but doesn't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link. 

Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion: the establishment services division, which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card; the travel division; and the merchandise sales division. 

The vacation packages include hotel accommodations and, in some cases, tours or tickets to local attractions, but not meals.
Destinations are Chicago; Honolulu; Las Vegas, Nev.; Los Angeles; Miami Beach, Fla.; New Orleans; New York; Orlando, Fla.; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C.
A buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion's ticket free if they fly on United Airlines. 

In lieu of the vacation, buyers can choose among several prizes, including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder.
Card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes.
If they test-drive a Buick, they get an American Express calculator. 

This isn't Buick's first travel-related promotion.
A few years ago, the company offered two round-trip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car.
The promotion helped Riviera sales exceed the division's forecast by more than 10%, Buick said at the time. 

Savin Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $35.2 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $3.8 million, or one cent a share. 

A spokesman for the Stamford, Conn.based company said operations had a loss of $5.5 million for the quarter; in addition, the loss was magnified by nonrecurring charges totaling $23.5 million and $8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as "unusual." The charges were partly offset by a $2 million gain on the sale of investments of two joint ventures, he said. 

Revenue declined 8% to $85.7 million, from $93.3 million a year earlier.
Savin cited "a general softening in the demand for office products in the market segments in which Savin competes." 

David A. DiLoreto, president of metal container division, was named to the additional post of group vice president, packaging products, at this packaging, industrial and aerospace products concern, succeeding Delmont A. Davis, who was named president and chief operating officer in August. 

Sony Corp. completed its tender offer for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., with Columbia shareholders tendering 99.3% of all common shares outstanding by the Tuesday deadline. 

Sony Columbia Acquisition Corp., formed for the Columbia deal, will formally take ownership of the movie studio later this month, a spokesman said.
Sony is paying $27 a share, or $3.55 billion, cash and is assuming $1.4 billion of long-term debt. 

Still unresolved is Sony's effort to hire producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber to run the studio.
Sony's planned acquisition of Guber/Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million is scheduled to close Monday.
Guber/Peters has been locked in litigation with Warner Communications Inc. in an attempt to get out of an exclusive production contract with Warner.
Both sides are in talks to settle the dispute. 

Hadson Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter net loss of $17 million to $19 million because of special reserves and continued low natural-gas prices. 

The Oklahoma City energy and defense concern said it will record a $7.5 million reserve for its defense group, including a $4.7 million charge related to problems under a fixed-price development contract and $2.8 million in overhead costs that won't be reimbursed. 

In addition, Hadson said it will write off about $3.5 million in costs related to international exploration leases where exploration efforts have been unsuccessful. 

The company also cited interest costs and amortization of goodwill as factors in the loss. 

A year earlier, net income was $2.1 million, or six cents a share, on revenue of $169.9 million. 

William C. Walbrecher Jr., an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank, was named president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit, Fidelity Federal Bank. 

The appointment takes effect Nov. 13.
He succeeds James A. Taylor, who stepped down as chairman, president and chief executive in March for health reasons.
Edward L. Kane succeeded Mr. Taylor as chairman. 

Separately, Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.3 million, or 68 cents a share, versus net income of $5.3 million, or $1.61 a share, a year earlier. 

The latest results include some unusual write-downs, which had an after-tax impact of $4.9 million.
Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition, which was terminated on Sept. 27, 1989.
In addition, operating results were hit by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Citadel shares closed yesterday at $45.75, down 25 cents. 

Reed International PLC said that net income for the six months ended Oct. 1 slipped 5% to #89.7 million ($141.9 million), or 16 pence a share, from #94.8 million ($149.9 million), or 17.3 pence a share. 

The British paper, packaging and publishing concern, said profit from continuing lines fell 10% to #118 million from #130.6 million. 

While there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period, there was a one-time gain of #18 million in the 1988 period.
And while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations, last year they contributed #34 million, before tax. 

Pretax profit fell 3.7% to #128 million from #133 million and was below analysts' expectations of #130 million to #135 million, but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in London. 

Reed is paying an interim dividend of 4.6 pence, up 15% from 4 pence a year earlier. 

Sales fell 20% to #722 million. 

Earnings were hurt by disposal of operations in its restructuring, Reed said. 

The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm.
We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who've been hurt.
But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk, technology and innovation.
Too often now, a single court decision becomes the precedent for other, less compelling cases. 

From the 1940s until 1971, some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness.
The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies, often under generic labels.
In the 1970s, scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users. 

The cases quickly went to court, but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs couldn't recall whose brand they used.
Beginning in 1980, courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable.
Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same, and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales. 

This has some logic.
Drug makers shouldn't be able to duck liability because people couldn't identify precisely which identical drug was used.
But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope.
Just as all plaintiffs are not alike, it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties.
The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v.
Lilly, where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz's mother didn't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages. 

But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes, by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California.
Despite the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case, there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants.
The big problem, however, is that there's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to DES or to drugs. 

The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine.
The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs.
The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs, citing the huge, hidden social costs. "Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs, even though some risks, perhaps serious ones, might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering," the unanimous court said.
The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug, Bendectin, off the U.S. market. 

This raises the key issue: What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs?
We now know that holding drug makers liable where there's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs won't be available to anyone.
As liability expert Peter Huber tells us, after the Hymowitz case, if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug "it's time to sell that company's stock short." We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway; some win the legal lottery, others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way. 

DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts.
Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs.
But a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation. 

Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass.
We have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases.
They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody, but know it won't be done by Congress. 

Dow Jones & Co. said it extended its $18-a-share offer for Telerate Inc. common stock until 5 p.m. EST Nov. 9. 

The offer, valued at about $576 million for the 33% of Telerate that Dow Jones doesn't already own, had been set to expire Nov. 6. 

Dow Jones, which owns about 64 million of Telerate's 95 million common shares outstanding, said that about 24,000 shares have been tendered under its offer. 

Telerate's two independent directors have rejected the offer as inadequate.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Telerate shares closed at $19.50, up 12.5 cents. 

Telerate provides an electronic financial information network.
Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, and community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases. 

In the aftermath of the stock market's gut-wrenching 190-point drop on Oct. 13, Kidder, Peabody & Co. 's 1,400 stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed at quashing the country's second-largest program trader. 

The target of their wrath?
Their own employer, Kidder Peabody. 

Since October's minicrash, Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading, the computer-driven, lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes. 

But the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market.
The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards.
Program trading itself, according to many academics who have studied it, is merely caught in the middle of this battle, unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace.
The evidence indicates that program trading didn't, in fact, cause the market's sharp fall on Oct. 13, though it may have exacerbated it. 

On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms, their pension fund clients with immense pools of money, and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges.
These are the main proponents of program trading. 

Defending their ramparts are Wall Street's Old Guard -- the traditional, stock-picking money managers, tens of thousands of stock brokers, the New York Stock Exchange's listed companies and the clannish floor traders, known as specialists, who make markets in their stocks. 

So far, Wall Street's Old Guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle, successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors. 

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a major futures marketplace, yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market, and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading. 

Stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot, almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage, a common form of program trading, for their own accounts in the past few days.
A few, such as giant Merrill Lynch & Co., now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients. 

The Old Guard's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based, in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake.
Some, such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman, have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators "stop the numbers racket on Wall Street." 

Big Board stock specialists, in a bold palace revolt, began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the Big Board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading. 

Charles Wohlstetter, the chairman of Contel Corp. who is rallying other CEOs to the anti-program trading cause, says he has received "countless" letters offering support. "They said universally, without a single exception: Don't even compromise.
Kill it," he says. 

Wall Street's New Guard isn't likely to take all this lying down for long, however.
Its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable.
Program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country, and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them.
What's more, the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it. 

Even some members of the Old Guard, despite their current advantage, seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard.
Last week, Robert M. Bradley, one of the Big Board's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders' organization, surrendered.
He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines, rather than people.
He said the exchange is "headed for a real crisis" if program trading isn't curbed. 

"I do not want my money invested in what I consider as nothing more than a casino," Mr. Bradley wrote. 

The battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations, causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee.
At Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., and other big brokerage firms, stockbrokers battle their own firm's program traders a few floors away.
Corporations like Contel denounce program trading, yet Contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like Bankers Trust Co. that are also big program traders. 

The Big Board -- the nation's premier stock exchange -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives.
Its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs.
But the Big Board's leadership -- over the specialists' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock "basket" product designed to facilitate program trading. "A lot of people would like to go back to 1970," before program trading, Mr. Phelan said this week. "I would like to go back to 1970.
But we are not going back to 1970." 

Again and again, program-trading's critics raise the "casino" theme.
They say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation's free-enterprise system, turning the stock market into a big gambling den, with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor. "The public didn't come to the market to play a game; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that," says A. Brean Murray, chairman of Brean Murray, Foster Securities, a traditional money management firm. 

The program traders, on the other hand, portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry.
Critics like Mr. Murray "are looking for witches, and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman," says J. Thomas Allen, president of Advanced Investment Management Inc., a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $200 million fund that uses index arbitrage. "Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection." 

For all the furor, there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage, the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading.
Like other forms of arbitrage, it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case, a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets. 

That divergence is what stock index traders seek.
When it occurs, the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks (such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market; they lock in the difference in price as profit. 

Such program trades, which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock, occur in a matter of seconds.
A program trade of $5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $25,000.
To keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives, traders must seize every opportunity their computers find. 

The speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise. "If you continue to do this, the investor becomes frightened -- any investor: the odd lotter, mutual funds and pension funds," says Larry Zicklin, managing partner at Neuberger & Berman. 

But many experts and traders say that program trading isn't the main reason for stock-market gyrations. "I have not seen one iota of evidence" to support restrictions on program trading, says a Vanderbilt University finance professor, Hans Stoll, an authority on the subject.
Says the Big Board's Mr. Phelan, "Volatility is greater than program trading." 

The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders, but by news of the unraveling of the $6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp. Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares, takeover-stock speculators, or risk arbitragers, dumped every blue-chip stock they had.
While program trades swiftly kicked in, a "circuit breaker" that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible.
Susan Del Signore, head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co., says critics are ignoring "the role the {takeover stock} speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility." Many arbs are "overleveraged," she says, and they "have to sell when things look like they fall apart." 

Like virtually everything on Wall Street, the program-trading battle is over money, and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the New Guard in recent years.
Take the traditional money managers, or "stock pickers," as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys.
Traditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $100 they manage for big institutional investors, and higher fees for smaller investors.
Yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with, much less beat, the returns of standard benchmarks like the S&P 

Not surprisingly, old-style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the S&P 500.
The indexers charge only a few pennies per $100 managed.
Today, about $200 billion, or 20% of all pension-fund stock investments, is held by index funds. 

The new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms.
These small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30% to 40% a year on their capital, by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks.
The specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell. 

And they believe the Big Board, under Mr. Phelan, has abandoned their interest.
The son of a specialist and once one himself, Mr. Phelan has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets. 

Meanwhile, specialists' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility. "When the sell programs hit, you can hear the order printers start to go" on the Big Board trading floor, says one specialist there. "The buyers walk away, and the specialist is left alone" as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks, he contends. 

No one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation's stockbrokers.
They are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market's swings since then. "Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them, and these wide swings are scaring them to death," says Raymond A. Mason, chairman of regional broker Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore.
Stockbrokers' business and pay has been falling.
Last year, the average broker earned $71,309, 24% lower than in 1987. 

Corporate executives resent that their company's stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket.
Index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 often don't even know what the companies they own actually do, complains Andrew Sigler, chairman of Champion International Corp. "Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs?
Oh, you're in the paper business," is one reaction Mr. Sigler says he's gotten from his big institutional shareholders. 

By this September, program traders were doing a record 13.8% of the Big Board's average daily trading volume.
Among the top practitioners were Wall Street blue bloods: Morgan Stanley & Co., Kidder Peabody, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Group Inc.
But then came Oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the Old Guard, particularly against index arbitrage.
The indexers' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die. "There's a lynch-mob psychology right now," says the top program-trading official at a Wall Street firm. "Wall Street's cash cow has been gored, but I don't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem." 

Too much money is at stake for program traders to give up.
For example, stock-index futures began trading in Chicago in 1982, and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched.
Stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s.
Now, on a good day, Chicago's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the Big Board trades in stock. 

Now the stage is set for the battle to play out.
The anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from Congress.
Program traders' "power to create total panic is so great that they can't be allowed to have their way," says Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. "We have to have a system that says to those largest investors: `Sit down! You will not panic, you will not put the financial system in jeopardy. '" 

But the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon.
Many people, including the Big Board, think that it's too late to put the genie back in the bottle.
The Big Board's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions, but a total ban isn't being considered, Big Board officials say. 

"You're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks," says Vanderbilt's Prof.
Stoll. "Program trading is here to stay, and computers are here to stay, and we just need to understand it." 

Short of a total ban, some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms, which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors don't. 

One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the "good-faith" payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks.
Currently, margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7% compared with 50% for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative.
Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board, rather than the futures industry, to set such margins. 

Futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active.
Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell, they say. 

Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an "uptick rule"a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices, namely short sellers.
The Big Board's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price. 

But in 1986, program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations, to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets.
A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably.
Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the "pricing efficiency" of the futures and stock markets. 

James A. White contributed to this article. 

Fundamentalists Jihad Big Board Chairman John Phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings.
Thus the band-wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus. 

Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading.
As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept: Two separate markets in different locations, trading basically the same widgets, can't trade them for long at prices that are widely different.
In index arbitrage, the widget is the S&P 500, and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York.
To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity, someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago. 

If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index, he is likely to remain fully invested at all times. (Few, if any, index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100% exposure to stocks, and equally few will want to own less than a 100% position should stocks rise.) 

By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget, index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1% and 3% to the annual return of the S&P 500.
That represents a very thin "excess" return, certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective.
The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue. 

As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy, these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and, eventually, eliminated.
The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market.
The New York Stock Exchange's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares. 

So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget, how did "program trading" evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers?
All arguments against program trading, even those pressed without fact, conclude with three expected results after "reforms" are implemented: 1) reduced volatility, 2) a long-term investment focus, and 3) a level playing field for the small investor.
But many of these reforms are unneeded, even harmful. 

Reducing volatility.
An index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs.
Arbitrage doesn't cause volatility; it responds to it.
Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago. 

A large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures.
Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York, while functioning as a buyer in Chicago.
The start of the whole process is the key-someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move. 

Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York?
Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade.
In a competitive market, this investor has many ways to execute his transactions, and he will have more alternatives (both foreign and domestic) if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle.
If not Chicago, then in New York; if not the U.S., then overseas. 

Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage, but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity.
Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising, creating more volatility instead of less.
The speed of his transaction isn't to be feared either, because faster and cleaner execution is desirable, not loathsome.
If slowing things down could reduce volatility, stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future. 

Encouraging long-term investing.
We must be very cautious about labeling investors as "long-term" or "short-term." Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board's door saying: "Buyers welcome, sellers please go away!" The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive, and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term.
A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate. 

In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today.
Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change (1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example).
It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream "foul" on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise.
Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins? 

Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled "program-trading volatility" could be far worse than the perceived problem.
In using program trading as a whipping boy, fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products.
They may, however, risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves.
How does a nice new tax, say 5%, on any financial transaction sound?
That ought to make sure we're all thinking for the long term. 

Getting a level playing field.
This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading -- not because of its merits, but because of the firms championing the cause.
The loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors.
They continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell, while their clients continue to hope for superior performance.
Even with mutual funds, the little investor continues to tolerate high fees, high commissions and poor performance, while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees, lower commissions and less risk.
Yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company he follows. 

Almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy, and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences. 

If spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous, surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors.
The sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first, while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter.
Cost-effective index funds just aren't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay, and that institutional customers refuse to pay. 

Each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients, here or overseas.
Legislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors. 

So what is next for program trading?
Left to its own devices, index arbitrage will become more and more efficient, making it harder and harder to do profitably.
Spreads will become so tight that it won't matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit. 

If government or private watchdogs insist, however, on introducing greater friction between the markets (limits on price moves, two-tiered execution, higher margin requirements, taxation, etc.), the end loser will be the markets themselves.
Instead, we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants. 

Mr. Allen's Pittsburgh firm, Advanced Investment Management Inc., executes program trades for institutions. 

The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships. 

The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. "The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business.
Everything will be taken over by the new company," said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. 

Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities.
Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said. 

Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ($23.5 million).
Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. 

Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said. 

Waertsilae Marine's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. Carnival, which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented claims for $1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week. 

Waertsilae Marine's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court. 

Program trading is "a racket," complains Edward Egnuss, a White Plains, N.Y., investor and electronics sales executive, "and it's not to the benefit of the small investor, that's for sure." But although he thinks that it is hurting him, he doubts it could be stopped. 

Mr. Egnuss's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country.
But like Mr. Egnuss, few expect it to be halted entirely, and a surprising number doubt it should be. 

"I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor," says Leo Fields, a Dallas investor.
He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades, that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading. 

But he blames program trading for only some of the market's volatility.
He also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds.
He adds: "The market may be giving us another message, that a recession is looming." 

Or, as Dorothy Arighi, an interior decorator in Arnold, Calif., puts it: "All kinds of funny things spook the market these days." But she believes that "program trading creates deviant swings.
It's not a sound thing; there's no inherent virtue in it." She adds that legislation curbing it would be "a darned good idea." 

At the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta's Buckhead district, a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading.
Citing the October 1987 crash, Glenn Miller says, "It's like the last crash -- they threatened, but no one did anything." A. Donald Anderson, a 59-year-old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market's "fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies," doesn't see much point in outlawing program trading.
Those who still want to do it "will just find some way to get around" any attempt to curb it. 

Similarly, Rick Wamre, a 31-year-old asset manager for a Dallas real-estate firm, would like to see program trading disappear because "I can't see that it does anything for the market or the country." Yet he isn't in favor of new legislation. "I think we've got enough securities laws," he says. "I'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit." 

Peter Anthony, who runs an employment agency in New York, decries program trading as "limiting the game to a few," but he also isn't sure it should be more strictly regulated. "I don't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism," he explains. 

And surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading. 

Glenn Britta, a 25-year-old New York financial analyst who plays options for his personal account, says he is "factoring" the market's volatility "into investment decisions." He adds that program trading "increases liquidity in the market.
You can't hold back technology." And the practice shouldn't be stopped, he says, because "even big players aren't immune to the rigors of program trading." 

Also in New York, Israel Silverman, an insurance-company lawyer, comments that program trading "increases volatility, but I don't think it should be banned.
There's no culprit here.
The market is just becoming more efficient." Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets, he says.
He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund, and volatility, on a given day, may hurt the fund.
But "I'm a long-term investor," he says. "If you were a short-term investor, you might be more leery about program trading." 

Jim Enzor of Atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge. "If we have a real bad day, the program would say, `Buy, '" he explains. "If you could get the rhythm of the program trading, you could take advantage of it." 

What else can a small investor do? 

Scott Taccetta, a Chicago accountant, is going into money-market funds.
Mr. Taccetta says he had just recouped the $5,000 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13.
Now, he plans to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990. 

In October, before the market dropped, Mrs. Arighi of Arnold, Calif., moved to sell the "speculative stocks" in her family trust "so we will be able to withstand all this flim-flammery" caused by program trading.
She believes that the only answer for individuals is to "buy stocks that'll weather any storm." 

Lucille Gorman, an 84-year-old Chicago housewife, has become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts.
Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge. 

"My stocks are all blue chips," she says. "If the market goes down, I figure it's paper profits I'm losing.
On the other hand, if it goes way sky high, I always sell.
You don't want to get yourself too upset about these things." 

Young's Market Co., a wholesaler of spirits, wines and other goods, said it will merge with a new corporation formed by the Underwood family, which controls Young's. 

Under terms of the agreement, shareholders other than the Underwoods will receive $3,500 a share at closing, which is expected in December.
The Underwood family said that holders of more than a majority of the stock of the company have approved the transaction by written consent. 

A nickname for measures to stop the market from plunging too far too fast.
Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility.
On the Big Board, a "side car" is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points.
The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, S&P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day's close for half an hour.
If, when trading resumes, the S&P futures fall 30 points from the previous day's close, a one-hour trading halt takes effect.
Also, the reforms allow the Big Board to halt trading for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points, and for two more hours if the Dow slides an additional 150 points on the same day. 

DOT System -- The "Designated Order Turnaround" System was launched by the New York Stock Exchange in March 1976, to offer automatic, high-speed order processing.
A faster version, the SuperDot, was launched in 1984.
Used by program traders and others to zip orders into the exchange, SuperDot handles about 80% of all orders entered at the exchange. 

Futures Contracts -- Obligations to buy (for those who have purchased a contract) or deliver (for those who sold one) a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price by a certain date.
Most contracts are simply nullified by an opposite trade before they come due. 

Indexing -- Many investors, mainly institutions, follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such as the S&P 500.
Many institutional index funds are active program traders, swapping their stocks for futures when profitable to do so. 

Program trading -- A wide range of computer-assisted portfolio trading strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks. 

Quant -- Generally, any Wall Street analyst who employs quantitive research techniques.
The newest breed, also called "rocket scientists" because of their backgrounds in physics and mathematics, devise the complex hedging and trading strategies that are popularly known as program trading. 

Stock-index arbitrage -- Buying or selling baskets of stocks while at the same time executing offsetting trades in stock-index futures or options.
Traders profit by trying to capture fleeting price discrepancies between stocks and the index futures or options.
If stocks are temporarily "cheaper" than futures, for example, an arbitrager will buy stocks and sell futures. 

Stock-index futures -- Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date.
The cash value is determined by multiplying the index number by a specified amount.
The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & poor's 500-stock index (traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange); the Major Market Index, a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average (traded on the chicago Board of Trade); and the S&P 100 options (traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500). 

Stock-index options -- Options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call) or sell (a put) a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price, known as the strike price.
For stock indexes, the underlying investment may be a stock-index futures contract or the cash value of a stock index.
For example, there are options on the S&P 500 futures contract and on the S&P 100 index. 

Uptick -- An expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security.

The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd. 

The department said it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchase's possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires. 

BTR PLC, a U.K. industrial conglomerate, said in June it had sold its National Tyre Service business to Michelin Investment Ltd., a U.K. unit of the tire maker, for #140 million ($221.4 million).
Michelin Tyre is a unit of France's Michelin S.A. 

Michelin officials couldn't immediately comment on the referral, but they noted the purchase from BTR has already been concluded. 

National Tyre, which has 420 branches throughout the U.K., had 1988 pretax profit of #8.5 million. 

For six years, T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode: kind and gentle.
The question now: Can he act more like hard-charging Teddy Roosevelt? 

Mr. Hahn, the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. is leading the forest-product concern's unsolicited $3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder, a reaction Mr. Hahn hasn't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions, all of which were negotiated behind the scenes. 

So far, Mr. Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough. "We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction," he says. 

But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war, with all that implies.
If a competitor enters the game, for example, Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival. 

Given that choice, associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold. 

"There's a price above which I'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay," says A.D. Correll, Georgia-Pacific's executive vice president for pulp and paper.
Says long-time associate Jerry Griffin, vice president, corporate development, at WTD Industries Inc.: "He isn't of the old school of winning at any cost." 

He also is a consensus manager, insiders say.
The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa, for example, was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on, says Mr. Correll.
Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn.
But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand.
In 1970, Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building. 

That impressed Robert B. Pamplin, Georgia-Pacific's chief executive at the time, whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute.
In 1975, Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals; the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who didn't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world. 

But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks, demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on.
The son of a physicist, Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates.
Moving rapidly through school, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18, after spending only 2 1/2 years in college.
He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

Mr. Hahn agrees that he has a "retentive" memory, but friends say that's an understatement.
They call it "photographic". 

Mr. Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of Georgia-Pacific.
Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983, he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business.
Mr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses, such as oil and gas and chemicals.
He even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers. 

At the same time, he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling, rather than materials for new-home construction.
The idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction. 

The formula has paid off, so far.
Georgia-Pacific's sales climbed to $9.5 billion last year, compared with $6 billion in 1983, when Mr. Hahn took the reins.
Profit from continuing operations has soared to $467 million from $75 million.
Mr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best. 

"The record of companies that have diversified isn't all that impressive," he says. 

Nekoosa wouldn't be a diversification.
It would be a good match, Mr. Hahn and many analysts say, of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows.
The resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $13 billion. 

But can Mr. Hahn carry it off?
In this instance, industry observers say, he is entering uncharted waters.
Says Kathryn McAuley, an analyst at First Manhattan Co.: "This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced." 

Leon J. Level, vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern, and F. Warren McFarlan, a professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Business, were elected directors, increasing board membership to nine.

Lewis C. Veraldi, the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, retired early after experiencing recent heart problems. 

Most recently, Mr. Veraldi, 59 years old, has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co.
But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S. 

Under the so-called Team Taurus approach, Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers, assembly-line workers, auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle. 

The concept's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford's product development more responsive to consumer demands.
It was later applied to other new-car programs, including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar. 

Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has "helped to change the world's perception of American-made cars." Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years, holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions. 

Elco Industries Inc. said it expects net income in the year ending June 30, 1990, to fall below a recent analyst's estimate of $1.65 a share. 

The Rockford, Ill., maker of fasteners also said it expects to post sales in the current fiscal year that are "slightly above" fiscal 1989 sales of $155 million.
The company said its industrial unit continues to face margin pressures and lower demand. 

In fiscal 1989, Elco earned $7.8 million, or $1.65 a share.
The company's stock fell $1.125 to $13.625 in over-the-counter trading yesterday. 

Tony Lama Co. said that Equus Investment II Limited Partnership has proposed changing the offer for the company to $13.65 in cash and stock from an all-cash transaction. 

Under terms of the new proposal, Equus, managed by Equus Capital Corp., Houston, would pay $12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $1.65 a share for each of Tony Lama's 2.1 million shares outstanding.
Previously, it offered $13.65 a share in cash, or $29 million. 

The El Paso, Texas, maker of Western boots and leather accessories said the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12% rate, but wouldn't be paid for the first two years.
The stock would be redeemed in five years, subject to terms of the surviving company's debt. 

Neither Equus nor Tony Lama gave a reason for the changed offer and Tony Lama couldn't be reached for comment.
However, Tony Lama said it would promptly submit the offer to a special committee of the company's board. 

New York financier Saul Steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15% of United Airlines' parent, UAL Corp., saying he might seek control of the nation's second-largest airline. 

Although takeover experts said they doubted Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself, the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid. 

Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control.
But some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings, which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold. 

Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it doesn't mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control. "Maybe he just wants to make something happen," said one takeover expert. 

One investment banker said Mr. Steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor-management bid.
Mr. Steinberg, he suggested, could replace British Airways PLC, which has withdrawn from the buy-out group. 

Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $6.79 billion, $300-a-share labor-management buy-out.
Reliance acquired a 7% UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $110 a share, and reduced its stake to 4.7% after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $282 a share. 

Market sources said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake, and thus wouldn't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock.
But the exact amount of Reliance's current holding hasn't been formally disclosed. 

The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners, a New York money manager, has bought more than 5% of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board's decision last week to remain independent.
Speculation about Coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $145. 

UAL's announcement came after the market closed yesterday.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, the shares closed at $177, up $1.50.
UAL wouldn't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by Reliance.
Reliance confirmed the filing but wouldn't elaborate. 

Some takeover experts were skeptical, saying it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL. 

Mr. Steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with UAL's Mr. Wolf.
The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc. Mr. Wolf's success in that job helped him land the top job with UAL in December 1987. 

But any potential acquirer must attempt to reach some kind of accord with the company's employees, primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists' union, which has opposed a takeover. 

The Bush administration's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a "qualified" rating, rather than "well qualified." 

People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will vote on the nomination, said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter.
Mr. Thomas, currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court.
Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies.
Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomas's nomination because of "serious questions about his judgment {and} respect for the law." 

A senior Justice Department official, however, said the administration isn't worried about the ABA rating. "We're pleased the ABA rated him qualified," David Runkel, the department's chief spokesman, said in an interview. 

The ABA gives a "qualified" rating to nominees it believes would perform "satisfactorily" on the bench.
In contrast, the lawyers' association gives a "well qualified" rating to those "regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy." 

Olympia Broadcasting Corp. said it didn't make a $1.64 million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $23.4 million of senior subordinated debentures. 

The radio-station owner and programmer said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions.
It said it needs to make the payment by Dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt. 

In September, the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business. 

Consumer confidence stayed strong in October, despite the unsettling gyrations of the stock market. 

"The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have had little or no effect on consumers," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research center. "Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event." 

The nonprofit, industry-supported group said its Consumer Confidence Index was 116.4 in October, barely changed from a revised 116.3 in September.
The index was 116.9 in October 1988 and in the past year has ranged from a low of 112.9 to a high of 120.7.
It uses a base of 100 in 1985. 

In October, more people said that present business conditions were "good" than in September.
An equal number in each month said that employment conditions were good. 

And 19.6% of consumers contacted believed business conditions will improve in the coming six months, compared with 18.3% in September.
Also, more people said conditions will worsen in the period. (Fewer said conditions won't change.) In October 1988, 21.1% said business conditions would improve. 

In October 1989, 16.9% said more jobs will be created in the coming six months, compared with 17.4% in September and 18.6% in October 1988.
Only 26.8% in October, compared with 28.5% in September and 26.8% in October 1988, said income would increase. 

"The sustained level of confidence can be attributed to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumer's day-to-day economic life," said Mr. Linden. "Unemployment continues at a relatively low level, providing a sense of job security, and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong." 

The consumer confidence survey, covering 5,000 U.S. households, is conducted in the first two weeks of each month for the Conference Board by National Family Opinion Inc., a Toledo, Ohio, market researcher.
Buying plans were mixed in October, with fewer households indicating plans to buy cars and more saying they will buy homes and appliances in the coming six months. 

In October, 6.7% of respondents said they will buy a car, easing from September when 8.1% anticipated a purchase.
In October 1988, 7.3% said they would buy a car. 

Home purchase plans increased to 3.3% from 3.1% in the two recent months.
In October 1988, 3.7% said they would buy a house.
In 1989, home purchase plans have ranged monthly from 2.9% to 3.7% of respondents.
In October, 30.6% said they will buy appliances in the coming six months, compared with 27.4% in September and 26.5% in October 1988. 

FALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off-year elections. 

Odd-year elections attract relatively few ballot issues.
But the 1989 fall total of 80, while well below 1988 activity, shows "a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives," says Patrick McGuigan, editor of Family, Law and Democracy Report.
He says the 10 citizen-sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd-year this decade.
Ballot questions range from a Maine initiative on banning Cruise missiles to a referendum on increasing the North Dakota income tax. 

Ballot watchers say attention already is focused on the 1990 elections.
In California, two petition drives for next year's election are "essentially finished," says David Schmidt, author of "Citizen Lawmakers." Mr. McGuigan cites three completed efforts in Oklahoma.
Hot ballot topics are expected to be abortion, the environment and insurance reform. 

Taking a cue from California, more politicians will launch their campaigns by backing initiatives, says David Magleby of Brigham Young University. 

PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTING gains new stature as prices rise. 

Price records are being set at auctions this week.
At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000, a single-lot record.
Other works also have been exceeding price estimates.
In part, prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints.
This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby's. "There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says. 

Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers, giving greater market stability, says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector. "When I see prints going into the hands of institutions, I know they aren't going to come back on the market." Most in demand: classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray.
But much contemporary work is also fetching "a great deal of money," says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography. 

DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services. 

Currently a $300 million-a-year business, 900 telephone service is expected to hit $500 million next year and near $2 billion by 1992 as uses for the service continue to expand, says Joel Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.
The service -- which costs the caller from 30 cents to $25 a minute -- currently is dominated by celebrity chatter, horoscopes and romance lines.
But more serious applications are in the wings, and that is where the future growth is expected. 

"I'm starting to see more business transactions," says Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co., noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales, software tutorials and even service contracts.
Colleges, she says, are eyeing registration through 900 service.
Charities test the waters, but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising. "The thing that will really break this market right open is merchandising," Ms. West says. 

Much of the 800 service will "migrate to 900," predicts Jack Lawless, general manager of US Sprint's 900 product. 

FAMILY PETS are improving recovery rates of patients at Columbia Hospital, Milwaukee.

DIAPER SERVICES make a comeback amid growing environmental concerns. 

Concerned about shrinking landfills and the safety of chemicals used in super-absorbent disposables, parents are returning to the cloth diaper.
Tiny Tots Inc., Campbell, Calif., says business is up 35% in the past year. "We're gaining 1,200 new customers each week," says Jack Mogavero of General Health Care Corp., Piscataway, N.J.
In Syracuse, N.Y., DyDee Service's new marketing push stresses environmental awareness.
Among its new customers: day-care centers that previously spurned the service. 

The National Association of Diaper Services, Philadelphia, says that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in starting diaper services.
Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College, Pa., where she lives, didn't have one.
Diaper shortages this summer limited growth at Stork Diaper Services, Springfield, Mass., where business is up 25% in 

Also spurring the move to cloth: diaper covers with Velcro fasteners that eliminate the need for safety pins.

Rep. John Dingell, an important sponsor of President Bush's clean-air bill, plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue: acid rain. 

The Michigan Democrat's proposal, which is expected today, is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain.
The administration's plan could cost utilities, mainly those that use coal, up to $4 billion a year. 

The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House's work on clean-air legislation.
As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation. 

People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain, though additional cuts could be ordered later.
Mr. Bush's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000. 

Although final details weren't available, sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the president's proposal for a cap on utilities' sulfur-dioxide emissions.
That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth.
It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters. 

In addition, it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country, sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills.
The administration, sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases, has staunchly opposed cost-sharing. 

Mr. Dingell's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members, apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing.
It isn't clear, however, whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House's acid-rain plan. 

While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities, it might not win the support of utilities, many in the West, that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels.
Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns. 

Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush doesn't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto. 

Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors, as well as the views of previous presidents. 

A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure.
Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure.
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case. 

But the two legal experts, responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), wrote in a joint letter that the president "lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto." The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal. 

The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills, not partial measures.
Moreover, they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items, and there was no discussion of a line-item veto.
They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War, and "all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach" of the president. 

Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power, but that it would be a "reckless course of action" for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval. 

The record corn-buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline. 

The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships. 

River barge rates have soared 40% this fall from a year earlier.
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business.
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets. 

The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October, which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S.
The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January, which would be a strain in most years. 

But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River, on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas. 

"We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record," said William Dunton, a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert. "It is going to be real tight." 

Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains, the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time. 

In a few weeks, many barges probably won't be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River, which feeds into the Mississippi River.
The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it. 

Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation. 

But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month.
At St. Louis, the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed, an Army Corps spokesman said.
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years. 

So far, the grain industry's budding logistical problems haven't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade.
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers. 

At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $2.375 a bushel. 

Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought.
With the harvest winding down, however, some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver. 

Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices.
Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles, they have more than enough storage space for their new crop, and that permits them to wait for prices to rise. 

In parts of Iowa, for example, some grain elevators are offering farmers $2.15 a bushel for corn.
Many farmers probably wouldn't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel, said Lyle Reed, president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo, Iowa. 

It isn't clear, however, who would win a waiting game.
Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought, the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins. 

Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation. "The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped," said Bill Biedermann, Allendale Inc. research director. 

Although much of this country's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge, it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port. 

Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans.
One railroad, for example, is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore. 

And it isn't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace.
The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays.
The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall.
But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems. 

In other commodity markets yesterday: 

ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading, but much of the action was in heating oil.
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire, tightening an already tight European market.
Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon, up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $19.94 a barrel.
Gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday. 

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets.
December delivery gold fell $3.20 an ounce to $377.60.
December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $5.2180.
January platinum was down $5.70 an ounce at $494.50.
Precious metals, gold in particular, currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability, according to William O'Neill, vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York. "The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities," he said.
Yesterday, the stock market rose strongly, creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders, he said.
Silver and platinum, which have more of an industrial nature than gold, were even weaker, he said.
Silver is also under pressure of "extremely high" inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange, he said.
Yesterday, these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces, according to an exchange spokesman. 

COPPER: Futures prices partially recovered Monday's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike.
The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $1.14.
In Chile, workers at two copper mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada, yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow, an analyst said.
Reasons for the walkout, the analyst said, included a number of procedural issues, such as a right to strike.
The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks.
In the case of copper, he said, the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal.
Also contributing to the firmness in copper, the analyst noted, was a report by Chicago purchasing agents, which precedes the full purchasing agents' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's October index rose to 51.6% after three previous months of readings below 50%.
The September index was 47.1%.
A reading below 50% generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy, while a reading above 50% points to expansion.
The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50%. 

Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record, net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $59.9 billion last year. 

The previous record was $57.7 billion in 1987, according to the Agriculture Department. 

Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988, as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices, the department's Economic Research Service reported yesterday.
Most of those states set farm income records. 

The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains.
What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had "mortgaged" to the government under price-support loan programs.
With prices soaring, they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at "considerable profit," the agency's 240-page report said. 

In less parched areas, meanwhile, farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices. 

To the surprise of some analysts, net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states, including Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress. 

Last year's record net cash income confirms the farm sector's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s.
It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year. 

Commodity prices have been rising in recent years, with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year, as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses.
At the same time, export demand for U.S. wheat, corn and other commodities strengthened, said Keith Collins, a department analyst.
Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices, as the nation's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low. 

"All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture," Mr. Collins said. 

California led the nation with $6.5 billion in net cash income last year, followed by Texas, $3.9 billion; Iowa, $3.4 billion; Florida, $3.1 billion; and Minnesota, $2.7 billion.
Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income. 

Despite federal disaster relief, the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers, according to the department.
Many lost their farms. 

Department economists don't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was.
Indeed, net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline.
At the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets. 

Last year, government payments to farmers slipped to less than $14.5 billion from a record $16.7 billion in 1987.
Payments are expected to range between $9 billion and $12 billion this year. 

Robert L. Bernstein, chairman and president of Random House Inc., announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years. 

A successor wasn't named, which fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr., whose family company, Advance Publications Inc., owns Random House.
Abrupt departures aren't unheard of within the Newhouse empire. 

In an interview, Mr. Bernstein said his departure "evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that's the decision I reached." He declined to elaborate, other than to say, "It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute.
Sometimes you just go with your gut." Mr. Bernstein said he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor, who is to be named soon. 

Mr. Newhouse, meanwhile, insisted that he isn't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House, the largest trade publishing house in the U.S.
The company said the publisher's annual sales volume increased to $800 million from $40 million during Mr. Bernstein's tenure. "Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly," said Mr. Newhouse. "The company is doing well, it's stable, it's got good people.
Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time." 

Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years, some of the bigger ones haven't been absorbed so easily.
Crown Publishing Group, acquired last year, is said to be turning in disappointing results.
As a private company, Random House doesn't report its earnings. 

Mr. Bernstein, who succeeded Bennett Cerf, has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925.
Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house.
Possible candidates include Susan Petersen, president of Ballantine/Del Rey/ Fawcett, Random House's huge and successful paperback division.
Some say Anthony Cheetham, head of a recently acquired British company, Century Hutchinson, could be chosen. 

There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side, in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb, who left Random House's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker, also owned by the Newhouse family. 

Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans, recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House, and Sonny Mehta, president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit.
When Ms. Evans took her job, several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor weren't included partly because she didn't wish to be a full-time administrator.
Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently. 

Mr. Bernstein, a tall, energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive, has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues. 

A man from the Bush administration came before the House Agriculture Committee yesterday to talk about the U.S.'s intention to send some $100 million in food aid to Poland, with more to come from the EC.
The committee's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland's own farmers.
Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt.
However well intentioned, food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country's own farmers.
The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness.
It should be constantly stressed that Poland's farmers mostly need a real market for their products. 

DD Acquisition Corp., a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp. 's Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara Operations Ltd., extended to Nov. 20 its $45-a-share offer for all Dunkin' Donuts Inc. shares outstanding. 

The offer, which was due to expire yesterday, is conditional on 50.1% of Dunkin' common shares, on a fully diluted basis, being tendered and on the withdrawal of the company's poison pill rights plan. 

DD Acquisition has launched a suit in a Delaware court seeking the withdrawal of Dunkin's poison pill rights and employee stock ownership plans, which it claims were put in place to deter bidders. 

DD Acquisition said 2.2 million shares, or about 38.5% of the shares outstanding, have been tendered under its offer.
The partners said they already hold 15% of all shares outstanding. 

Dunkin' has set Nov. 10 as the deadline for the receipt of any competing bids.
DD Acquisition said the extension is to allow this process to be completed.
Dunkin' is based in Randolph, Mass.
Cara, a food services chain operator and Unicorp, a holding company, are based in Toronto. 

Ratners Group PLC, a fast-growing, acquisition-minded London-based jeweler, raised its price for Seattle-based specialty jeweler Weisfield's Inc. to $57.50 a share, or $62.1 million, from $50 a share, or $55 million, after another concern said it would be prepared to outbid Ratners's initial offer.
The other concern wasn't identified. 

Ratners's chairman, Gerald Ratner, said the deal remains of "substantial benefit to Ratners." In London at mid-afternoon yesterday, Ratners's shares were up 2 pence (1.26 cents), at 260 pence ($1.64). 

The sweetened offer has acceptances from more than 50% of Weisfield's shareholders, and it is scheduled for completion by Dec. 10. 

The acquisition of 87-store Weisfield's raises Ratners's U.S. presence to 450 stores.
About 30% of Ratners's profit already is derived from the U.S. 

Your Oct. 6 editorial "The Ill Homeless" referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Your comments implied we had discovered that the "principal cause" of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population.
We have made no such statement.
It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless.
The "causes" of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case. 

In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism.
You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.
They suffered from malnutrition, chest diseases, cardiovascular disorders, skin problems, infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape.
Homeless people not only lack safety, privacy and shelter, they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition, cleanliness and basic health care.
In a recent report, the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness, others may be a consequence of it, and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter.
The interactions between health and homelessness are complex, defying sweeping generalizations as to "cause" or "effect." 

If we look to the future, preventing homelessness is an important objective.
This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess, an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research.

A study by Tulane Prof.
James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems, with the common thread of poverty.
The study shows that nearly 40% of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25% of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug, alcohol and mental problems. 

According to Dr. Wright, homelessness is "simultaneously a housing problem, an employment problem, a demographic problem, a problem of social disaffiliation, a mental health problem, a family violence problem, a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending, a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family, and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level."

To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in New York: "If you're homeless, you don't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered.
After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation, you're scarcely in touch with reality any more; without psychiatric treatment, you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again." 

Some of the homeless, obviously, had pre-existing mental illness or addiction.
But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim, brutal world of our city streets.
Once there, what ways of escape are open to them other than drink, drugs or insanity? 

Maxwell R.D. Vos 

Brooklyn, N.Y. 

You dismiss as "sentimental" the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77% might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan-Bush years.
There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic: namely, that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness.
Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made. 

Robert S. Jenkins 

Cambridge, Mass. 

Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless, you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that "know a good thing when they see it," and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive.
But isn't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to, and advertise in, your paper?
Why didn't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march? 

As for the findings on the 203 Baltimore homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations, I suggest you conduct your own survey.
Choose 203 business executives, including, perhaps, someone from your own staff, and put them out on the streets, to be deprived for one month of their homes, families and income.
I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their "normal" phobias, anxieties, depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically.

A.L. Williams Corp. was merged into Primerica Corp., New York, after a special meeting of Williams shareholders cleared the transaction, the companies said. 

Primerica, which had owned nearly 70% of Williams, will pay about 16.7 million shares, currently valued at almost $472 million, for the rest of Williams.
The financial-services company will pay 0.82 share for each Williams share. 

Williams shares, which were to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after the close of composite trading yesterday, closed at $23.25, off 12.5 cents.
Primerica closed at $28.25, down 50 cents. 

Williams, Duluth, Ga., is an insurance and financial-services holding company.
Its subsidiaries' services are marketed by closely held A.L. Williams & Associates.
Primerica, as expected, also acquired certain assets of the agency and assumed certain of its liabilities.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Coleco Industries Inc., a once high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked at $65 a share in the early 1980s, filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders. 

Under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed about $430 million, would receive about $92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed.
In addition, they will receive stock in the reorganized company, which will be named Ranger Industries Inc.
After these payments, about $225,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding. 

The Avon, Conn., company's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer, but the product was plagued with glitches and the company's fortunes plunged.
But Coleco bounced back with the introduction of the Cabbage Patch dolls, whose sales hit $600 million in 1985.
But as the craze died, Coleco failed to come up with another winner and filed for bankruptcy-law protection in July 1988. 

The plan was filed jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in New York and must be approved by the court. 

NCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers. 

The new software is based on Novell Inc. 's NetWare network operating system software. 

"Feeding Frenzy" (Henry Holt, 326 pages, $19.95), a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal, begins on a reassuring note. 

Right up front in the preface, co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity.
When offered a free trip from the Bronx, Wedtech's home, to Washington, D.C., by one of Wedtech's principals, he tells the reader, "mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about, I declined." 

Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive, high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers.
Bribe by bribe, Mr. Sternberg and his co-author, Matthew C. Harrison Jr., lead us along the path Wedtech traveled, from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor, entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy. 

The book revolves around John Mariotta, the founder of the company, and Fred Neuberger, who became his partner soon after Wedtech's creation.
Although started in 1965, Wedtech didn't really get rolling until 1975, when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government's Section 8(A) minority business program.
This is a Johnson-era, Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses.
Mr. Neuberger realized that, although of Italian ancestry, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico.
The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation.
Instead of 50/50 it became, on paper only, two-thirds Mariotta, one-third Neuberger, and they were in the program and off to the races. 

Besides being a "minority-owned company" Wedtech was located in the South Bronx, a blighted area, made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign.
The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s. 

Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi (now serving a jail sentence), the company began a career of bribing federal, state and local public officials and those close to public officials, right up to and including E. Robert Wallach, close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese.
Wedtech didn't just use old fashioned bribery.
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling, retaining politically connected "respectable" law firms, investment bankers and political consultants, including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger.
When necessary, it sought and received assistance from organized crime. 

Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company.
Wedtech management used the merit system.
If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag, but equity.
If you were not an effective crook, you found yourself out in the cold, a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta, the firm's semiliterate "minority" person. 

But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy, easy-to-read tabloid writing style, "Feeding Frenzy" often falls short of gripping reading.
None of the scams show much ingenuity: Auditors found crookery the first day on the job.
Wedtech's scammers simply bribed them to shut up. 

The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes, conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses, Mercedes cars, beautiful women, expensive clothes.
Among the lot of them, not one is wrestling with good and evil, or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane.
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz, a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack.
He enters the story toward the end, just in time to get arrested. 

Absorbed in doling out "Feeding Frenzy's" tidbits, the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech, namely the Section 8(A) federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place.
They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end "rigid affirmative action programs." Programs like Section 8(A) are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up.
Numerous other scandals, among them the ones at HUD, have the same characteristics as Wedtech.
They take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption. 

Why are programs like this not eliminated? "Feeding Frenzy" does provide a few clues.
In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party.
They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth, regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment, there is big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government.
They are our version of the East bloc's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change.
How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders?
This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal. 

Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp., 1983-85. 

A lack of enthusiasm with the latest economic data hampered the stock market's bid to extend Tuesday's sharp gains, as prices closed slightly higher in sluggish trading. 

While renewed optimism about the outlook for takeover activity boosted several so-called deal stocks, traders said profit-taking weighed on the market, with blue-chips bearing the brunt of the selling. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had jumped 41.60 points on Tuesday, drifted on either side of its previous close and finished with a gain of just 0.82 at 2645.90. 

Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index added 0.84 to 341.20; the rise was equivalent to a gain of about six points in the industrial average.
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 0.99 to 319.75 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went up 0.60 to 188.84. 

Advancing stocks led decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by 847 to 644.
Big Board volume amounted to 154,240,000 shares, down from 176.1 million Tuesday. 

The October survey of corporate purchasing managers, as expected, provided evidence that economic growth remains subdued.
An index of economic activity drawn from the survey stood last month at 47.6%; a reading above 50% would have indicated that the manufacturing sector was improving. 

But with the index proving somewhat better than expected and the widely anticipated report on October employment scheduled to arrive tomorrow, stock prices firmed only modestly in response to the report and then faltered. 

"This market's still going through its pains," said Philip Puccio, head of equity trading at Prudential-Bache Securities. "The psychology is still: `We want (stocks) up, but if they don't carry we're going to sell them. '" 

Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to curtail stock-index arbitrage, a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market, also contributed to its lack of direction, Mr. Puccio said. 

Arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined largely to a round of buy programs near the close, which helped offset the impact of profit-taking among blue chips. 

Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates. "I sense that some people are reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come out," said Richard Eakle, president of Eakle Associates, Fair Haven, 

Campbell Soup jumped 3 3/8 to 47 1/8 as the resignation of R. Gordon McGovern as president and chief executive officer sparked a revival of rumors that the company could become a takeover target.
Prudential-Bache Securities boosted the stock's short-term investment rating in response to the departure; analyst John McMillin said he believes the company will turn to new management "that's more financially oriented." 

Other rumored takeover and restructuring candidates to attract buyers included Woolworth, which went up 1 3/4 to 59 1/2; Avon Products, up 1 3/4 to 29 1/4; Paramount Communications, up 2 to 57 7/8, and Ferro, up 2 5/8 to 28 3/4. 

Upjohn, a rumored target within the drug industry, advanced 7/8 to 38 7/8.
The company said it plans a fourth-quarter charge, which it didn't specify, for an early-retirement program. 

AMR climbed 1 3/4 to 73 1/8 amid rumors that New York developer Donald Trump was seeking financing to mount a new, lower offer for the parent company of American Airlines.
Mr. Trump withdrew a $120-a-share bid last month. 

UAL rose 1 1/2 to 177.
Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Michael Derchin said he sees a 70% chance that the parent of United Airlines, the target of a failed $300-a-share offer from a labor-management group, will be acquired or restructured within six months. 

Georgia Gulf added 1 3/4 to 51 1/4 after NL Industries, controlled by Dallas investor Harold Simmons, offered to acquire the stock it doesn't already own for $50 a share.
NL, which closed unchanged at 22 3/4, has a stake of just under 10%. 

Great Northern Nekoosa, which surged 20 1/8 Tuesday after Georgia-Pacific launched a $3.18 billion offer for the company, dropped 1 3/8 to 61 1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 5.1 million shares.
Georgia-Pacific, which went down 2 1/2 Tuesday, lost another 1/2 to 50 3/8. 

Other paper and forest-products stocks closed mixed.
Mead rose 3/4 to 39 1/2, Federal Paper Board added 1/2 to 24 3/8 and Scott Paper gained 1/2 to 48 3/8, while International Paper> fell 7/8 to 48 7/8,>< Champion In< ternational lost 3/8 to 31 1/2 and Louisiana-Pacific dropped 1/8 to 40 1/4. 

Texaco rose 3/4 to 53 3/8 as 4.4 million shares changed hands.
Most of the volume came from trades designed to capture the stock's next dividend; Texaco has a yield of 5.6% and goes ex-dividend today. 

Santa Fe Pacific dropped 1 1/8 to 17 3/4.
The company's proposal to sell a 20% stake in its real-estate unit for around $400 million has caused analysts to consider whether to cut their estimates of Santa Fe's asset value. 

GenCorp tumbled 2 to 14.
The company forecast that fourth-quarter income from continuing operations would be "significantly" lower than a year earlier. 

Allergan went up 1/2 to 19 3/8.
The Food and Drug Administration allowed the company to begin marketing a new lens for use in cataract patients. 

The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index gained 1.56 to 372.14.
Volume totaled 11,390,000 shares. 

Old Spaghetti Warehouse rose 1 to 16 1/8.
Its net income for the September quarter rose about 41% from a year ago. 

Meridian National Corp. said it sold 750,000 shares of its common stock to the McAlpine family interests, for $1 million, or $1.35 a share.
The sale represents 10.2% of Meridian's shares outstanding. 

The McAlpine family, which operates a number of multinational companies, including a London-based engineering and construction company, also lent to Meridian National $500,000.
That amount is convertible into shares of Meridian common stock at $2 a share during its one-year term.
The loan may be extended by the McAlpine group for an additional year with an increase in the conversion price to $2.50 a share. 

The sale of shares to the McAlpine family along with the recent sale of 750,000 shares of Meridian stock to Haden MacLellan Holding PLC of Surrey, England and a recent public offering have increased Meridian's net worth to $8.5 million, said William Feniger, chief executive officer of Toledo, Ohio-based Meridian. 

First of America Bank Corp. said it completed its acquisition of Midwest Financial Group Inc. for about $250 million.
First of America, which now has 45 banks and $12.5 billion in assets, announced an agreement to acquire the Peoria, Ill., bank holding company in January. 

Midwest Financial has $2.3 billion in assets and eight banks.
The Midwest Financial subsidiary banks will continue to operate under their current names until early 1990, when each will adopt the First of America name. 

Kalamazoo, Mich.-based First of America said it will eliminate the 13 management positions of the former Midwest Financial parent company.
First of America said some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America.
But it said that severance payments to those executives not staying with the company will reduce First of America's operating results for 1989 by $3 million to $4 million, or 15 cents to 20 cents a share. 

The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks. 

The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions.
As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities.
An appeal is expected. 

In response to the ruling, gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session.
Gilts, or British government bonds, which also fell sharply initially, retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower. 

The council, which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over #6 billion ($9.5 billion), lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals.
At one point, Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10% of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings. 

When two parties engage in an interest-rate swap, they are betting against each other on future rates.
Thus, an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments.
In most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks, which would make fixed-rate payments.
As interest rates rose, municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them. 

The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued that local councils aren't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities.
The council backed the audit commission's stand that the swap transactions are illegal.
Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions, the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils. 

"While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith, it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature," a solicitor representing one of the banks said. 

Already, 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings.
Other financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC, Security Pacific Corp., Chemical Banking Corp. 's Chemical Bank, Citicorp's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International. 

If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal, it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways, some market sources said.
Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils. 

Officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable.
The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly. 

Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association took an $89.9 million charge as it reported a third-quarter loss of $70.7 million, or $12.09 a share. 

The Van Nuys, Calif., thrift had net income of $132,000, or three cents a share, a year ago. 

The bulk of the pretax charge is a $62 million write-off of capitalized servicing at the mobile home financing subsidiary, which the company said had been a big drain on earnings.
The company said the one-time provision would substantially eliminate all future losses at the unit.
Valley Federal also added $18 million to realestate loan reserves and eliminated $9.9 million of good will. 

The thrift said that "after these charges and assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates, the association expects to achieve near record earnings in 1990." 

Valley Federal is currently being examined by regulators.
New loans continue to slow; they were $6.6 million in the quarter compared with $361.8 million a year ago.
The thrift has assets of $3.2 billion. 

Tokyo stocks edged up Wednesday in relatively active but unfocused trading. 

London shares finished moderately higher. 

At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which gained 132 points Tuesday, added 14.99 points to 35564.43. 

In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index fell 63.79 points to 35500.64. 

Wednesday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 900 million shares, in line with Tuesday's 909 million. 

Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing issues, 454 to 451. 

Investors switched trading focus quickly as they did Tuesday, reflecting uncertainty about long-term commitments to any issue or sector, traders said. 

Speculation, on the other hand, sparked buying in certain incentive-backed issues, though rumors underlying such shares eventually proved untrue.
The development, traders said, showed that there is more than ample liquidity available for investment despite the market's recent directionless trend. 

Dealers led the market Wednesday by actively trading for their own accounts, observers said. 

Institutions mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar. 

The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 16.05 points Tuesday, was down 1.46 points, or 0.05%, at 2691.19. 

The Second Section index, which added 6.84 points Tuesday, was up 5.92 points, or 0.16%, to close at 3648.82. 

Volume in the second section was estimated at 18 million shares, up from 14 million Tuesday. 

Akio Yamamoto, managing director of Nomura Investment Trust Management, said that if the U.S. federal funds rate declines to around 8.5%, institutions would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying.
Tokyu Group, Mitsubishi Estate and Bridgestone/Firestone, which advanced Tuesday, declined on profit-taking.
Wednesday's dominant issue was Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance, which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying.
It ended the day up 80 yen (56 cents) to 1,880 yen ($13.15). 

Due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the U.S. currency, investor interest was directed toward oil and mining shares, which traders called a "defensive" action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation. 

Teikoku Oil, also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying, advanced 100 yen to 1,460.
Showa Shell gained 20 to 1,570 and Mitsubishi Oil rose 50 to 1,500. 

Sumitomo Metal Mining fell five yen to 692 and Nippon Mining added 15 to 960. 

Among other winners Wednesday was Nippon Shokubai, which was up 80 at 2,410. 

Marubeni advanced 11 to 890. 

London share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on Wall Street and technical factors affecting demand for London's blue-chip stocks. 

The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 17.5 points higher at 2160.1.
It rose largely throughout the session after posting an intraday low of 2141.7 in the first 40 minutes of trading.
The index ended the day near its session high of 2163.2, which was posted within the last half-hour of trading. 

Dealers said most investor interest was focused on defensive blue-chip stocks, particularly those with limited U.K. exposure.
Also, several key blue chips were pushed higher in thin volume because of a technical squeeze among market makers. 

Sterling's firm tone, combined with a steady opening on Wall Street, also tempted some investors to come back to the market, dealers said.
There were concerns early in the day that Wall Street's sharp gains on Tuesday were overdone and due for a reversal. 

The FT 30-share index settled 16.7 points higher at 1738.1.
Volume was 372.9 million shares, up from 334.5 million on Tuesday. 

Dealers said institutions were still largely hugging the sidelines on fears that the market's recent technical rally might prove fragile.
They cited Wall Street's recent volatility and the lack of a clear indication over the market's short-term direction as factors in the institutional caution. 

Jaguar, a U.K. luxury auto maker being pursued by Ford Motor and General Motors, gained 10 pence (16 cents) a share to close at 879 pence ($13.90).
It shed about 7 pence, however, after dealers said the market was disappointed that Ford didn't move to tender a bid for control of the company. 

Dealers said the U.K. government's decision Tuesday to waive its protective "golden share" in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two U.S. auto giants. 

But the waiver also was seen as a signal that Ford, a major U.K. auto industry employer, was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of Jaguar.
Dealers said that interpretation sparked expectations of an imminent bid by Ford. 

B.A.T Industries, which is being pursued by Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments, rose 9 to 753 on speculation that Hoylake will sweeten its bid, dealers said.
Like Jaguar, B.A.T also eased off its highs in afternoon dealings. 

Reed International, a U.K. publishing group, gained 15 to 397 despite reporting a 3.7% drop in interim pretax profit. 

Analysts said the fall in pretax profit was due to the group's recent restructuring and sale of peripheral units, and that its remaining businesses are performing well.
Dealers said the market agreed. 

Stocks boosted by market-makers shopping to cover book requirements in FT-SE 100 shares included Carlton Communications, which climbed 32 to 778. 

Drug companies in the key index also notched gains as market-makers searched for stock in anticipation of demand due to the sector's defensive qualities.
Wellcome gained 18 to 666 on a modest 1.1 million shares.
Glaxo, the U.K.'s largest pharmaceutical concern, advanced 23 to #14.13. 

Stock prices closed higher in Stockholm, Amsterdam and Frankfurt and lower in Zurich.
Paris, Brussels, and Milan were closed for a holiday.
South African gold stocks closed marginally lower. 

Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Singapore, Taipei and Wellington, were mixed in Hong Kong, lower in Seoul and little changed in Sydney.
Manila markets were closed for a holiday. 

Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
The percentage change is since year-end. 

R. Gordon McGovern was forced out as Campbell Soup Co. 's president and chief executive officer, the strongest evidence yet of the power that Dorrance family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company. 

Herbert M. Baum, the 53-year-old president of the company's Campbell U.S.A. unit, and Edwin L. Harper, 47, the chief financial officer, will run Campbell as a team, dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named.
The board already has been searching for strong outside candidates, including food-industry executives with considerable international experience. 

Wall Street reacted favorably to Mr. McGovern's departure and its implications.
In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Campbell's shares rose $3.375 to close at $47.125. 

"The profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better," said John McMillin, a food industry analyst for Prudential-Bache in New York.
Mr. McGovern was widely seen as sales, and not profit, oriented. "New managers would think a little more like Wall Street," Mr. McMillin added.
Some of the surge in the stock's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation, which has contributed to volatility of Campbell shares in recent months. 

Campbell's international businesses, particularly in the U.K. and Italy, appear to be at the heart of its problems.
Growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in U.S. units. 

For example, Campbell is a distant third in the U.K. frozen foods market, where it recently paid 24 times earnings for Freshbake Foods PLC and wound up with far more capacity than it could use.
Similarly, Campbell's Italian biscuit operation, D. Lazzaroni & Co., has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems. 

Such problems will require considerable skill to resolve.
However, neither Mr. Baum nor Mr. Harper has much international experience. 

Mr. Baum, a seasoned marketer who is said to have a good rapport with Campbell employees, will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the Pepperidge Farm unit.
Mr. Harper, a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined Campbell in 1986, will take charge of all overseas operations as well as Pepperidge. 

In an joint interview yesterday, both men said they would like to be the company's next chief executive. 

Mr. McGovern, 63, had been under intense pressure from the board to boost Campbell's mediocre performance to the level of other food companies.
The board is dominated by the heirs of the late John T. Dorrance Jr., who controlled about 58% of Campbell's stock when he died in April.
In recent months, Mr. Dorrance's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity. 

In August, the company took a $343 million pretax charge against fiscal 1989 earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan.
The plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 jobs.
But analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing, especially in Europe, and there were signs that the board became impatient. 

Campbell officials said Mr. McGovern wasn't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure.
The company's prepared statement quoted him as saying, "The CEO succession is well along and I've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement." 

But people familiar with the agenda of the board's meeting last week in London said Mr. McGovern was fired. 

Mr. McGovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October 1991, "unless I get fired." Campbell said Mr. McGovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting, scheduled for Nov. 17. 

For fiscal 1989, Mr. McGovern received a salary of $877,663.
He owns about 45,000 shares of Campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares.
He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $244,000 with certain other fringe benefits. 

During Mr. McGovern's nine-year term as president, the company's sales rose to $5.7 billion from $2.8 billion and net income increased to $274 million from $130 million, the statement said. 

Mr. Baum said he and Mr. Harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988. "You've got to make the restructuring work," said Mr. Baum. "You've got to make those savings now." 

Mr. Harper expressed confidence that he and Mr. Baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company. "We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team," he said.
He predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive. 

Mr. Baum said the two have orders to "focus on bottom-line profits" and to "take a hard look at our businesses -- what is good, what is not so good." Analysts generally applaud the performance of Campbell U.S.A., the company's largest division, which posted 6% unit sales growth and a 15% improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989. "The way that we've been managing Campbell U.S.A. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company," Mr. Baum said. 

In the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon, both men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together. "You've got two champions sitting right before you," said Mr. Baum. "We play to win." 

Criminal charges were filed against Diceon Electronics Inc. and two company officials alleging waste disposal violations in its Chatsworth, Calif., facility. 

The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the Irvine, Calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid, caustic and heavy metals into the sewer system, and stored hazardous materials in leaky, unlabeled or open-top containers. 

Named as defendants were Roland Matthews, president, and Peter Jonas, executive vice president and chief financial officer, as well as a former plant manager.
The company said local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to "routine inspection" in August. "The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court." Arraignments are scheduled for Nov. 14.

The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but don't always represent actual transactions.

The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants, and proposed $7.3 million in fines, the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer. 

The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $6.1 million for alleged violations at the company's Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility.
OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical, crane-safety, record-keeping and other requirements. 

A second citation covering the company's Clairton, Pa., coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements, for which OSHA proposed $1.2 million in fines. 

Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said, "The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health, and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards." 

OSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972.
Gerard Scannell, the head of OSHA, said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years, "yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards." 

"Particularly flagrant," Mrs. Dole said, "are the company's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works, in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies." That settlement was in April 1987. 

A USX spokesman said the company hadn't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine. "Once we do, they will receive very serious evaluation," the spokesman said. "No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees." 

USX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works.
He said that, if and when safety problems were identified, they were corrected. 

The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell.
He has promised stiffer fines, though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year. 

"The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants," said Linda Anku, OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia.
USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties, before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. 

Before the USX case, OSHA's largest proposed fine for one employer was $4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co., a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co., Cincinnati.
The company is contesting the fine. 

Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 's Bell Laboratories reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100, moving the materials closer to commercial use. 

The scientists said they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field.
The scientists said they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature, or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit.
Their report appears in today's issue of the journal Nature. 

The finding marks a significant step in research on "bulk" superconductors, which are aimed at use in wires for motors, magnets, generators and other applications.
Scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors, but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry. 

Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled.
A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised. 

The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome.
But "it won't lead to imminent use" of new superconductors, cautioned Robert B. van Dover, one of the AT&T researchers.
He added that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals.
Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications. 

Mr. van Dover said the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons, a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use. 

Still, scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding, because it demonstrates how to overcome the "flux pinning" problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors' potential.
The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals, limiting their current-carrying capacity.
Mr. van Dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place, preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity. 

Mr. van Dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem.
Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns.
The AT&T team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with "melt-textured growth," a process discovered earlier at Bell Laboratories.
The combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples. 

Oshkosh Truck Corp., Oshkosh, Wis., estimated earnings for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 50% to 75% below the year-earlier $4.5 million, or 51 cents a share. 

The truck maker said the significant drop in net income will result in lower earnings for the fiscal year.
In fiscal 1988, the company earned $17.3 million, or $1.92 a share, on revenue of $352.9 million. 

Oshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division, a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations. 

The company said it is in the process of phasing out John Deere, its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis.
In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory, the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period. 

Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership, an investment firm, completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co. 's Caldor discount chain for $500 million plus the assumption of $52 million in debt.

After years of struggling, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner will publish its last edition today, shut down by its parent, Hearst Corp., following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper. 

The demise of the 238,000-circulation Herald, once the nation's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000, turns the country's second-largest city into a one-newspaper town, at least in some senses.
The Los Angeles Times, with a circulation of more than 1.1 million, dominates the region.
But it faces stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register, which sells more than 300,000 copies a day, and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News, which sells more than 170,000.
Nearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach also have large dailies. 

In July, closely held Hearst, based in New York, put the paper on the block.
Speculation had it that the company was asking $100 million for an operation said to be losing about $20 million a year, but others said Hearst might have virtually given the paper away. 

An attempted buy-out led by John J. McCabe, chief operating officer, never materialized, and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as "tire-kickers and lookee-loos" had filed through since.
The prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun. 

The death of the Herald, a newsstand paper in a freeway town, was perhaps inevitable.
Los Angeles is a sprawling, balkanized newspaper market, and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times, then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies.
The Herald was left in limbo. 

Further, the Herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time Hearst readership -- blue-collar and sports-oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly, upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times.
Hearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan. 

The Herald joins the Baltimore News-American, which folded, and the Boston Herald-American, which was sold, as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s.
Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did, if marginally, because of its place in family history.
Its fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan, who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon.
William Randolph Hearst had kept an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance-style building. 

Analysts said the Herald's demise doesn't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry. "The Herald was a survivor from a bygone age," said J. Kendrick Noble, a media analyst with PaineWebber Inc. "Actually, the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end, and the industry looks pretty healthy." 

Founded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst, the Herald was crippled by a bitter, decade-long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half.
Financially, it never recovered; editorially, it had its moments.
In 1979, Hearst hired editor James Bellows, who brightened the editorial product considerably.
He and his successor, Mary Anne Dolan, restored respect for the editorial product, and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources, its accomplishments were notable.
For example, the Herald consistently beat its much-larger rival on disclosures about Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's financial dealings.
The Herald's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded. 

Robert J. Danzig, vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers, stood up in the paper's newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold, putting more than 730 full-time employees out of work. 

Hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days.
Some long-tenured employees will receive additional benefits, the company said.
Hours after the announcement, representatives of the Orange County Register were in a bar across the street recruiting. 

The reaction in the newsroom was emotional. "I've never seen so many people crying in one place at one time," said Bill Johnson, an assistant city editor. 

"So Long, L.A." was chosen as the paper's final headline. 

"I'm doing the main story, and I'm already two beers drunk," said reporter Andy Furillo, whom the Times hired away several years ago but who returned to the Herald out of preference.
His wife also works for the paper, as did his father. 

Outside, a young pressman filling a news box with an extra edition headlined "Herald Examiner Closes" refused to take a reader's quarter. "Forget it," he said as he handed her a paper. "It doesn't make any difference now." 

Follow-up report: 

You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week.
You can even take notes -- extensive notes, for the Voice folks won't look over your shoulder -- about what you read.
You can do all this even if you're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress. 

And my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts. 

Until the other day, you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world.
That was the law.
And I apparently had no right to print hither what the Voice was booming to yon. 

It was censorship.
It was outrageous.
And it was stupid. 

The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government shouldn't propagandize its own people.
That sounds neat, but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own people every day.
Government press releases, speeches, briefings, tours of military facilities, publications are all propaganda of sorts.
Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint, and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue. 

The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd: An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform. 

In June 1988, I wrote in this space about this issue.
Assuming it wasn't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door, I'll review the facts. 

The Voice of America is a government agency that broadcasts news and views -- some might say propaganda -- in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world.
It does a first-rate job.
Its budget$184 million -- is paid for by you.
But a 1948 law barred the "dissemination" of that material in the U.S.
The law let scholars, reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material, only at VOA headquarters in Washington, but it barred them from copying texts.
And, of course, there's that word "dissemination." 

How's that again? "You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying," a Voice official explained when I asked.
What if I tune in my short-wave radio, transcribe an editorial or program, and print it in my newspaper? "Nor are you free to reprint such material," I was advised. 

That sounded a lot like censorship, so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere, I sued. 

A couple of weeks ago, I lost the case in federal district court in Des Moines.
At least, that's the way it was reported.
And, indeed, the lawsuit was dismissed. 

But I -- I like to think of it in terms of we, all of us -- won the point. 

For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling: The United States Information Agency, which runs the Voice, changed its position on three key points. 

-- The USIA said that, on reflection, of course I could print anything I could get my hands on.
The word dissemination, it decided, referred only to itself. "The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States," my lawyer, the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines, said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost.
The court noted the new USIA position but, just in case, officially found "that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically." 

-- The USIA said that, on reflection, anyone could view the VOA materials, not just the reporters, scholars, researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute. "The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials, notwithstanding the statutory designations, because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials," Mr. McCormick noted. 

-- And the USIA said that all of us could take extensive notes. "The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and, while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes, no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken," Mr. McCormick reported. 

I had sought, in my suit, the right to print Voice material, which had been denied me, and I had sought a right to receive the information, arguing in effect that a right to print government information isn't very helpful if I have no right to get the information. 

But the court disagreed. "The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech," Judge Donald O'Brien ruled. "The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press." 

So now the situation is this: You have a right to read Voice of America scripts if you don't mind traveling to Washington every week or so and visiting the Voice office during business hours.
I have a right to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- copy them out in long hand.
But neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox machine or have it sent to us. 

In an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not, this does seem odd. 

Indeed, Judge O'Brien ruled that "it would be easy to conclude that the USIA's position is `inappropriate or even stupid, '" but it's the law.
So the next step, I suspect, is to try to get the law changed.
We (I assume you're in this with me at this point) need to get three words -- "for examination only" -- eliminated from the law. 

Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says Voice material shall be available to certain of us (but now, thanks to the USIA's new position, all of us) "for examination only." If those words weren't there, the nice people at the Voice would be able to send you the information or, at the very least, let you photocopy it. 

This is not a trivial issue. 

"You have . . . raised important questions which ought to be answered: What does USIA say about America abroad; how do we say it; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions?" a man wrote me a couple of years ago.
The man was Charles Z. Wick.
At the time, he was director of the 

He had no answers then. 

Now there are some. 

This democracy is suddenly a little more democratic. 

I feel pretty good about it.

Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Trinity said it plans to begin delivery in the first quarter of next year. 

N.V. DSM said net income in the third quarter jumped 63% as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program. 

The Dutch chemical group said net income gained to 235 million guilders ($113.2 million), or 6.70 guilders a share, from 144 million guilders, or 4.10 guilders a share, a year ago. 

The 32% state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter, mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations.
The charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company's construction division. 

Last year, DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions. 

The earnings growth also was fueled by the company's ability to cut net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders.
Also, substantially lower Dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth, the company added. 

Sales, however, were little changed at 2.46 billion guilders, compared with 2.42 billion guilders. 

Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move the news organization termed an "amicable separation." 

Mr. Reupke, 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran, had been the information-services company's general manager for only six months.
His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuters's editor in chief.
No successor was named, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said. 

In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for "personal reasons," which he declined to specify. "There is no business reason for my departure," nor any disagreement over policy, he added.
He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. 

Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. "If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board," he said. 

A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects "no change in strategy or profits." Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew in London, said, "I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company.
I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations." On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence ($14.43).
In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed unchanged at $43.875. 

The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke's duties is Nigel Judah, 58, finance director and a Reuters board director.
Peter Holland, 45, deputy general manager, becomes director of corporate affairs.
And Patrick Mannix, 46, international technical manager, becomes director of group quality programs. 

Junk-bond markdowns, an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, a Drexel Burnham Lambert connection, a fizzled buy-out rumor. 

All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman, Thomas Spiegel, who built the $12.7 billion Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift with high-yield junk bonds.
Bears have targeted Columbia's stock because of the thrift's exposure to the shaky junk market.
And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel's life style; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia's jet planes. 

Columbia stock recently hit 4 1/8, after reaching 11 3/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel would take the thrift private.
Moreover, junk professionals think Columbia's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $4.4 billion wasn't enough, meaning another markdown could be coming. 

But in recent days, Columbia has edged up, closing at 5 1/4, up 3/8, yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure.
Mr. Spiegel's fans say Columbia's Southern California branches are highly salable, and the thrift has $458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets.
That's almost $10 of equity for each Columbia share, including convertible preferred shares, though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion. 

Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands.
The Spiegel family has 25% of the common and 75% of the votes.
Other big common holders are Carl Lindner's American Financial, investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research, though the latter cut its stake this summer. 

While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia, investors say Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia's junk problems.
Indeed, Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking. 

Columbia won't comment on all the speculation.
But like other thrifts, it's expected to seek regulators' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity.
Plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so. 

New rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value, then sell the bonds over five years.
That's why Columbia just wrote off $130 million of its junk and reserved $227 million for future junk losses.
But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value, unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right. 

Columbia, a longtime Drexel client, won't provide current data on its junk.
But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered.
These were Allied Stores, Western Union Telegraph, Gillett Holdings, SCI Television and Texas Air, though many other bonds in Columbia's portfolio also have lost value.
Possibly offsetting that, Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $70 million.
It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings. 

One trial balloon Mr. Spiegel is said to have floated to investors: Columbia might be broken up, as Mellon Bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank.
But Columbia's good bank would be a regulated thrift, while the bad bank would be a private investment company, holding some of Columbia's junk bonds, real estate and equity investments. 

Some think Columbia's thrift, which now is seeking a new chief operating officer, might be capitalized at, say $300 million, and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence.
The thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity, financial industry executives say. 

Meanwhile, the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off to Columbia shareholders, including Mr. Spiegel, who might then have a new career, investors say. 

It isn't clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders.
But "the concept is workable.
You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank," says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York. 

Mr. Spiegel's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street.
Few people think Mr. Spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift, which current rules would force Columbia to become. 

"They aren't really a thrift," says Jonathan Gray, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst. 

Of course, regulators would have to approve Columbia's reorganization.
And some investment bankers say a restructuring isn't feasible while the SEC still is scrutinizing Mr. Spiegel's past junk-bond trades.

American City Business Journals Inc. said its president, Michael K. Russell, will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. 

Mr. Russell, who co-founded the Kansas City, Mo.-based local business publications concern here, said he would have a five-year consulting agreement with the company, which recently underwent an ownership change. 

Earlier this year Shaw Publishing Inc., Charlotte, acquired 30% of American City and has an agreement to acquire a further 25% from E.W. Scripps Co. next year.
Ray Shaw, chairman of American City, said he would assume Mr. Russell's responsibilities if a successor isn't found this month. 

Beauty Takes Backseat 

To Safety on Bridges 

EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced.
But there's disagreement over how to do it. 

Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges aren't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through.
But other people don't want to lose the bridges' beautiful, sometimes historic, features. 

"The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view," says Jack White, a planner with the Indiana Highway Department.
He and others prefer to install railings such as the "type F safety shape," a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings. 

In Richmond, Ind., the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge.
Garret Boone, who teaches art at Earlham College, calls the new structure "just an ugly bridge" and one that blocks the view of a new park below. 

In Hartford, Conn., the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced, the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park. 

Compromises are possible.
Citizens in Peninsula, Ohio, upset over changes to a bridge, negotiated a deal: The bottom half of the railing will be type F, while the top half will have the old bridge's floral pattern. 

Similarly, highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington, D.C., as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road. 

Tray Bon?
Drink Carrier 

Competes With Cartons 

PORTING POTABLES just got easier, or so claims Scypher Corp., the maker of the Cup-Tote. 

The Chicago company's beverage carrier, meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food outlets, resembles the plastic loops used on six-packs of beer, only the loops hang from a web of strings.
The new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once. 

Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling.
Lids aren't even needed.
He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers.
A few fast-food outlets are giving it a try. 

The company acknowledges some problems.
A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on, so the company supplies a window hook.
While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight, it isn't recyclable.
And unlike some trays, there's no place for food. 

Spirit of Perestroika 

Touches Design World 

AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides. 

An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities.
The show runs the gamut, from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building. 

The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie-Mellon and Leningrad's Mutchin Institute. 

Dan Droz, leader of the Carnegie-Mellon group, sees benefits all around.
The Soviets, who normally have few clients other than the state, will get "exposure to a market system," he says.
Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets. 

Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose. "In Moscow, they kept asking us things like, `Why do you make 15 different corkscrews, when all you need is one good one? '" he says. "They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones." 

Seed for Jail Solution 

Fails to Take Root 

IT'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal: Eggers Group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners.
It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures, the company says. 

But New York state, which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage, says "no." 

Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle, the New York firm says.
Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster, yet close enough to permit family visits. 

Besides, Eggers says, grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt. 

A number of cities -- including Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators, Eggers says.
A medium-sized one in Brooklyn, it says, could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York.
A spokesman for the state, however, calls the idea "not effective or cost efficient." 

USX Corp. posted a 23% drop in third-quarter profit, as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations. 

The nation's largest steelmaker earned $175 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with the year-earlier $228 million, or 80 cents a share.
The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $98 million from asset sales, while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $61 million.
In the 1988 period, USX also had a $71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement.
Sales rose 5% to $4.4 billion from $4.2 billion. 

The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year's unusually strong third quarter, when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing.
However, third-quarter operating profit fell 14%, as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments, eliminating income from those operations. 

Among segments that continue to operate, though, the company's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets.
Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said that a downturn in the appliance industry, coupled with sluggish automotive sales, hurt USX results.
Moreover, USX exports more than other steelmakers, and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure. 

The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain, Ohio, plant, which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan's Kobe Steel Ltd. 

In the steel division, operating profit dropped 11% to $85 million.
Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $33 a ton from $42 a ton last year and $53 a ton in the second quarter, analysts said.
Still, USX fared better than other major steelmakers, earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp., which posted a 54% drop in net income, or Inland Steel Industries Inc., whose profit plummeted 70%. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, USX shares closed up $1.25, at $34.625, as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who hadn't expected as great a volume of asset sales.
The rise in the stock's price may also reflect the fact that USX's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers'. 

Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year.
He said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products, such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet, than lower-priced structural goods. 

The energy segment, with a 15% rise in operating profit, is clearly the company's strongest.
Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $198 million from $180 million.
The Texas Oil & Gas division continues to operate in the red, although losses narrowed to $9 million from $15 million.
USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO's oil and gas reserves. 

Proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares.
The company noted that it has reduced debt by $1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987.
USX has about $5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding. 

The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1% and threatened a takeover or other business combination.
Mr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments. 

Profit for the nine months jumped 21% to $721 million, or $2.62 a share, from $598 million, or $2.07 a share.
Sales rose 10% to $13.8 billion from $12.5 billion. 

Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered to double-C from triple-C the rating on about $130 million of debt.
The rating concern said the textile and clothing company's interest expense exceeds operating profit "by a wide margin" and it noted United's estimated after-tax loss of $24 million for the year ended June 30. 

Due to an editing error, a letter to the editor in yesterday's edition from Frederick H. Hallett mistakenly identified the NRDC.
It should be the Natural Resources Defense Council.

RMS International Inc., Hasbrouk Heights, N.J., facing a cash-flow squeeze, said it is seeking other financing sources and waivers from debenture holders. 

The company said that because of softening sales it isn't in compliance with requirements that it maintain $3 million in working capital.
RMS distributes electronic devices and produces power supplies and plastic literature displays. 

RMS said it had a loss of $158,666, or 10 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $26,956, or two cents a share.
Sales rose to $3 million from $2.9 million. 

For the nine months, the company reported a net loss of $608,413, or 39 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $967,809, or 62 cents a share.
Sales rose to $9.8 million from $8.9 million. 

Despite a deluge of economic news, the Treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over International Business Machines Corp. 's huge debt offering. 

"There were so many economic reports but the market didn't care about any of them," said Kathleen Camilli, a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "So the focus turned to other fixed-income markets, corporate and mortgages in particular," she said. 

IBM, the giant computer maker, offered $750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47%, or about 1/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds. 

The size of IBM's issue was increased from an originally planned $500 million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds. 

In the investment-grade corporate market, "it's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features," said James Ednie, a Drexel industrial bond trader. 

Money managers ranked IBM's offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year because large issues of long-term debt by companies with triple-A credit are infrequent.
Syndicate officials at lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. said the debentures were snapped by up pension funds, banks, insurance companies and other institutional investors.
In the Treasury market, investors paid scant attention to the day's economic reports, which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy. 

"Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady, yesterday's economic indicators didn't change your opinion," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. 

The government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower.
Both indicators were viewed as signs that the nation's industrial sector is growing very slowly, if at all. 

A survey by the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy.
In a monthly report prepared for use at the Fed's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14., the nation's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks. 

Among other things, the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries.
The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts, for example, reported declines in manufacturing activity while the Boston, Dallas and San Francisco banks noted that business expanded. 

The purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in October, although it remains below 50%.
A reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50% suggests that the industry is expanding. 

Mr. Lieberman said the diverse showing in yesterday's reports "only enhances the importance of the employment data." The employment report, which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices, is due out tomorrow.
The average estimate of 22 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October.
The economists forecast a 0.1% rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4%. 

Treasury Securities 

In a surprise announcement, the Treasury said it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30-year bond rather than create a new one for next week's quarterly refunding of the federal debt. 

The Treasury will raise $10 billion in fresh cash by selling $30 billion of securities, including $10 billion of new three-year notes and $10 billion of new 10-year notes. 

But rather than sell new 30-year bonds, the Treasury will issue $10 billion of 29year, nine-month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30-year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in August. 

Credit market analysts said the decision to reopen the current benchmark, the 8 1/8% bond due August 2019, is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount.
Some dealers said the Treasury's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities, given uncertainties about when the auction will occur. 

The Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling.
Until such action takes places, the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind. 

Meanwhile, Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading.
The benchmark 30-year bond about 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
The benchmark was priced at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88% compared with 102 12/32 to yield 7.90% Tuesday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 100 22/32 to yield 7.88% compared with 100 16/32 to yield 7.90%. 

The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was essentially unchanged at 7.79%, while the rate on six-month bills was slightly lower at 7.52% compared with 7.60% Tuesday. 

Corporate Issues 

IBM's $750 million debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market. 

Meanwhile, most investment-grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point higher. 

In its latest compilation of performance statistics, Moody's Investors Service found that investment-grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7% in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5%.
Moody's said those returns compare with a 3.8% total return for longer-term Treasury notes and bonds.
Total return measures price changes and interest income. 

For the year to date, Moody's said total returns were topped by the 16.5% of longer-term Treasury issues, closely followed by 15% for investment-grade bonds.
Junk bonds trailed the group again. "Even the 7.2% return from the risk-free three-month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1% return from junk bonds," wrote Moody's economist John Lonski in yesterday's market report. "Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting," he said. 

Moody's said the average net asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2% in October. 

Mortgage-Backed Issues 

Mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the Treasury market. 

Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for November delivery finished at 98 5/8, up 2/32, and its 9 1/2% issue at 100 22/32, also up 2/32. 

The Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.32% to a 12-year average life. 

Activity was light in derivative markets, with no new issues priced. 

Municipal Issues 

Municipal bonds were mostly unchanged to up 1/8 point in light, cautious trading prior to tomorrow's unemployment report.
A $114 million issue of health facility revenue bonds from the California Health Facilities Financing Authority was temporarily withdrawn after being tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group. 

An official for the lead underwriter declined to comment on the reason for the delay, but market participants speculated that a number of factors, including a lack of investor interest, were responsible.
The issue could be relaunched, possibly in a restructured form, as early as next week, according to the lead underwriter. 

A $107.03 million offering of Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency, Calif., tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels today, according to an official with lead underwriter Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
The Santa Ana bonds were tentatively priced to yield from 6.40% in 1991 to 7.458% in 

Bucking the market trend, an issue of $130 million general obligation distributable state aid bonds from Detroit, Mich., apparently drew solid investor interest.
They were tentatively priced to yield from 6.20% in 1991 to 7.272% in 

Foreign Bond 

West German dealers said there was little interest in Treasury bonds ahead of Thursday's new government bond issue. 

So far, they said, investors appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the government to raise the coupon to more than 7%.
It is generally expected to be the usual 10-year, four billion mark issue.
Rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue, or that the last Bund, a 7% issue due October 1999, would be increased by two billion marks. 

Elsewhere: 

-- In Japan, the benchmark No. 111 4.6% issue due 1998 ended on brokers screens unchanged at 95.09 to yield 5.435%. 

-- In Britain, the benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 14/32 to 111 2/32 to yield 10.19%.
The 12% notes due 1995 fell 9/32 to 103 3/8 to yield 11.10%. 

A House-Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment. 

For the Agency for International Development, appropriators approved $200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program, and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package. 

The conference approved at least $55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well, and though no decision was made, both sides are committed to adding more than $200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration. 

The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill, which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year's budget.
These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package, and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending, the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe. 

To accommodate the additional cash assistance, the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $140 million from the Pentagon.
And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant, recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively. 

The action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $220 million for international population planning activities, an 11% increase over fiscal 1989.
The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations, but the size of the increase is itself significant. 

In a second area of common concern, the world environment, an additional $15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives, related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant. 

The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments, running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market. 

Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime, but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30, 1990.
About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated, according to the industry, but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate. 

The potential sales are nearly $9.3 million, and House Majority Whip William Gray (D., Pa.) began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean, such as Jamaica and Barbados.
Rep. Jerry Lewis, a conservative Californian, added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia, and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines-backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye.
Jamaica, wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies, has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray, but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye, who has strong ties to the sugar industry, is able to insert a claim by the Philippines. 

In separate floor action, the House waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990.
The funding is attached to an estimated $27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights. 

The leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House, but in recent days, the Senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the House.
The most recent example was a nearly $17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the State, Justice and Commerce departments.
And after losing a battle Tuesday night with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference. 

Its plans to be acquired dashed, Comprehensive Care Corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital. 

In all, the company hopes to repay $45 million in debt through the sales, which will completely discharge its secured debt, the company said. 

In addition, the company has replaced its president and chief executive, naming W. James Nichol, head of the company's contract health services, to succeed B. Lee Karns.
Mr. Nichol said he was "extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company's operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months." Concurrent with Mr. Nichol's appointment, Comprehensive Care moved its corporate headquarters from Irvine, Calif., to St. Louis, where the company maintained its contract services offices. 

Mr. Karns continues as chairman. 

Comprehensive Care had agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk, Va., but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Comprehensive Care closed at $3.75 a share, up 12.5 cents. 

Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words: "Provided, that no funds shall be spent. . . ." This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress.
It signals Congress's attempt, under the pretext of guarding the public purse, to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution. 

This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional.
The appropriations clause states that "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. . . ." The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding.
This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran-Contra Report. 

As partisans of congressional power understand, a "power of the purse" so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers.
It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution. 

The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes.
To the extent they did, their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability.
Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation.
It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause (technically a limitation on legislative power) could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress. 

As it went to the conference panel now deliberating, the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public's money.
During the coming weeks, President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or, alternatively, to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II, and thus void and severable. 

The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II. Article II places on the president the duty to nominate, "and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate" appoint, ambassadors, judges, and other officers of the U.S.
It also empowers the president to make recess appointments, without Senate approval: "The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session." 

Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides: "No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person." Thus, with one brief passage in an appropriations bill, Congress repeals the president's power to make recess appointments under Article II. 

Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing.
The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person's salary.
The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay, because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government. 

The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of "muzzling" provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution.
Muzzling provisions, which might be called "blindfold laws" as well, prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options, let alone from recommending them to Congress.
Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress, but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations. 

Typically, these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations.
Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny.
There is something inherently suspect about Congress's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other. 

Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill: "None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement, administer, or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States." 

This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president's execution of the law, since a one-house resolution could be said to be "duly adopted" even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto.
The Supreme Court's decision in INS v.
Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional. 

President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives.
If President Bush fails to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes.
What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents, including Democrats, to undo. 

President Reagan learned that lesson.
By 1987, then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president, through an appropriations rider, to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II. 

If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded, the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision, declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable.
The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power.
However, the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution.
The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto. 

Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto.
As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending, the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives.
The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability.
One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president, by exerting a power of excision, to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers. 

There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills.
If Congress does nothing, President Bush will have won.
If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court (assuming it can establish standing to sue), President Bush might win.
In that case, he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive. 

If President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v.
Olson was for the Reagan administration.
But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now.
Moreover, the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice. 

As it stands now, Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down.
President Bush should set things straight.
If he does not, he will help realize Madison's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature "everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex." 

Mr. Sidak served as an attorney in the Reagan administration.
His longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year. 

John F. Barrett, 40, formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer, was named president and chief operating officer, posts which had been vacant. 

Some Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years. 

The funding mechanism, which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush, would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. 

As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending, Congress cut by $30 million the Bush administration's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.
To offset the reduction, Congress approved a $20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers, acquisitions and certain other transactions. 

Some Democrats, led by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts. 

But Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them. "It could operate to augment our budget," James Rill, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, said in an interview. 

Under measures approved by both houses of Congress, the administration's request for $47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $15 million.
The FTC budget request of $70 million, about $34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement, would also be cut by $15 million.
The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989. 

The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
Under that law, parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions.
Currently, the government charges nothing for such filings. 

Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that, based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year, the fees will yield at least $40 million this fiscal year, or $10 million more than the budget cuts. "When you do that, there is not a cut, but there is in fact a program increase of $5 million" each for the FTC and the Justice Department, Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa) said during House debate. 

But Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif.) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity, reducing the amount of fees collected.
The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40% in the Reagan administration, and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period. "Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen," Mr. Edwards argued. 

Any money in excess of $40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large. 

Corporate lawyers said the new fees wouldn't inhibit many mergers or other transactions.
Though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect, government officials said they hadn't noticed any surge in filings. 

Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. said potential problems with the construction of two big cruise ships from Finland have been averted. 

Last week, Miami-based Carnival disclosed that Waertsilae Marine Industries, the Finnish shipyard that is building Carnival's new cruise ships, planned to file for bankruptcy. 

Yesterday, Carnival said a new company has been formed in Finland that will carry on Waertsilae's shipbuilding operations.
Carnival said it will be an 11% shareholder in the new company. 

Carnival said the Fantasy, a 2,050-passenger ship that was slated to be delivered this month, will be delivered in January. 

A second ship is now expected to be delivered late next year or early in 1991.
Carnival had expected that ship to be delivered next fall.
A planned third ship still may be built in the Finnish shipyard, or may be built elsewhere, Carnival said. 

The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry. 

Because of the rulings, the Commerce Department will continue to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act.
The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter's home market. 

ITC officials said final Commerce Department and ITC rulings won't come until next March or later.
If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law, the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports, which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements. 

Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $405 million from Taiwan, $400 million from South Korea and $125 million from Hong Kong, according to the ITC. 

In another action, the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington, Del., against imports of neoprene, a type of synthetic rubber, from France and West Germany.
These imports totaled about $17 million last year. 

Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said it was awarded U.S. patents for Interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein. 

The patent for Interleukin-3 covers materials and methods used to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology.
Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it.
Interleukin-3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with cancer treatment, bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders, Genetics Institute said. 

The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1, a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage.
The patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects, Genetics Institute said.
The company added that it has filed patent applications "on a large number of different BMP proteins" and the patent on BMP-1 is the first it has received.
BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers, the company said. 

Allergan Inc. said it received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell the PhacoFlex intraocular lens, the first foldable silicone lens available for cataract surgery. 

The len's foldability enables it to be inserted in smaller incisions than are now possible for cataract surgery, the eye care and skin care concern said.
Cataracts refer to a clouding of the eye's natural lens. 

Allergan was spun off in July from SmithKline Beckman Corp. as part of the merger of SmithKline and Beecham Group 

Rockwell International Corp. reported flat operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. 

The aerospace, automotive supply, electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough. 

In an interview, Donald Beall, chairman, said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year's, primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets.
Still, he added, if the industrial sector remains relatively stable, Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989's operating profit of $630.9 million. 

For fiscal 1989's fourth quarter, Rockwell's net income totaled $126.1 million, or 50 cents a share.
That compares with operating earnings of $132.9 million, or 49 cents a share, the year earlier. 

The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business, which made net $185.9 million, or 70 cents a share.
Sales rose 4% to $3.28 billion from $3.16 billion. 

Mr. Beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company's electronics segment. 

Overall, pretax electronics earnings soared 12% to $107.9 million from $96.4 million.
All four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30. 

For the year, electronics emerged as Rockwell's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings, muscling out aerospace for the first time. 

The graphics business, which also was singled out by the chairman as a positive, saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79% to $42.1 million from $23.5 million.
For the year, bolstered by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press, graphics earnings almost doubled. 

Aerospace earnings sagged 37% for the quarter and 15% for the year, largely due to lower B-1B program profit; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988.
That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines. 

The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship, according to analysts. 

For fiscal 1989, the company posted net of $734.9 million, or $2.87 a share, down from $811.9 million, or $3.04 a share, in fiscal 1988.
Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year, earnings per share were $2.47, up 7.4% from $2.30 in fiscal 1988.
Sales for the year rose 5% to $12.52 billion from $11.95 billion in fiscal 1988. 

ECONOMIC GROWTH APPEARS to be leveling off, latest reports suggest.
Factory orders and construction outlays were largely flat in September, while purchasing agents said manufacturing shrank further in October.
Still, many economists aren't predicting a recession anytime soon. 

The Fed is coming under pressure to cut short-term interest rates due to the apparent slowing of the economy.
But it isn't clear yet whether the central bank will make such a move. 

Campbell Soup forced out its president and chief executive, R. Gordon McGovern, the strongest indication yet that the Dorrance family plans to take charge of reshaping the troubled food company.
Campbell's stock rose $3.375, to $47.125, in reaction. 

The Chicago Merc plans an additional "circuit breaker" to stem sharp drops in the market.
Also, Big Board Chairman Phelan said he would support SEC halts of program trading during market crises but not any revival of a "collar" on trading. 

Georgia Gulf received a new takeover bid from investor Harold Simmons and NL Industries of $50 a share, or about $1.1 billion.
The offer, which follows a $55-a-share bid that was rejected in September, steps up pressure on the chemicals concern. 

The minimum-wage bill worked out by Congress and Bush won easy approval in the House.
The compromise plan, which boosts the minimum wage for the first time since 1981, is expected to clear the Senate soon. 

Steinberg sought clearance to buy more than 15% of United Air's parent, saying he may seek control.
Takeover experts said they doubted the financier would make a bid by himself. 

An airline buy-out bill was approved by the House.
The measure would make it easier for the Transportation Department to block leveraged buy-outs in the industry. 

USX was cited by OSHA for several health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants and may face a record fine of $7.3 million. 

Random House Chairman Robert Bernstein said he is resigning from the publishing house he has run for 23 years.
A successor wasn't named. 

Cray Research indicated that the survival of a spinoff company, which is developing a new supercomputer, depends heavily on its chairman and chief designer, Seymour Cray. 

Light trucks and vans will face the same safety requirements as automobiles under new proposals by the Transportation Department. 

The Treasury plans to sell $30 billion in notes and bonds next week but will delay the auction unless Congress quickly raises the debt ceiling. 

U.S. farmers' net income rose to a record $59.9 billion last year despite one of the worst droughts ever. 

Two antitrust agencies may face further cutbacks because of a complicated new funding device, some Democrats in Congress are warning.

Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest car maker, announced Wednesday that the parent concern's pretax earnings in the first half ended last Sept. 30 rose 14% to 88.32 billion yen ($618.1 million) from 77.6 billion yen a year earlier.
Nissan cited strong domestic sales against the backdrop of continuous economic expansion. 

Profit surged 42% to 40.21 billion yen, or 16.09 yen a share, from 28.36 billion yen, or 11.72 yen a share. 

Sales totaled 1.916 trillion yen, climbing 17% from 1.637 trillion yen in the year-earlier period. 

Nissan scheduled a seven-yen interim dividend payment, unchanged. 

Atsushi Muramatsu, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Nissan, said, "The company has experienced a remarkable turnaround in terms of profitability since the fiscal year ending March 1987, when the sharp and rapid appreciation of the yen caused many difficulties. 

"It can be said that the trend of financial improvement has been firmly set," he added. 

The parent of Younkers, after failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores, said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing. 

Equitable of Iowa Cos., Des Moines, had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain since June, when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business.
But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers "fair value" for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing. 

Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $313 million.
It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska. 

Younkers management is likely to buy a 10% to 20% interest in the chain in January, said Fred S. Hubbell, Equitable's president and chief executive officer.
He said Equitable hopes to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50%. 

The House passed legislation designed to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy-outs. 

The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor.
The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry, but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto. 

The broader question is where the Senate stands on the issue.
While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy-outs, the measure hasn't yet come to the full floor. 

Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline, it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt. "The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier's ability to compete," Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, (R., Ark.) said. 

The bill, as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15% or more of the stock in an airline.
The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished; it would be put into foreign control; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit. 

The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.) that would, in addition to the previous criteria, also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier's employees, or their wages or benefits. 

Rep. James Traficant (D., Ohio), said the amendment, which passed 271-147, would "let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally." But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision, which he dubbed a "special interest" amendment, was likely to make the bill even more controversial. 

On Tuesday, the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 

The provision, called the "two-time-losers" amendment by its supporters, apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline.

West German insurance giant Allianz AG entered the takeover battle between France's Cie.
Financiere de Paribas and Cie. de Navigation Mixte. 

Allianz said it won French government approval to buy as much as one-third of Navigation Mixte, a diversified financial, transport and food holding company.
The move comes a week after Paribas announced that it was preparing to bid for 66.7% control of Navigation Mixte. 

Munich-based Allianz's brief explanatory statement said it is acting to protect its own interests as a shareholder of Navigation Mixte.
That would be a blow to both Paribas and Navigation Mixte.
Each had claimed Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, as a tacit ally. 

The Allianz statement also reinforced the belief that the takeover battle could be a long one.
It led to broad market speculation that Paribas now will sweeten its bid, which is expected to be formally launched later this week, after approval from French government regulators. 

Allianz's entry reflects the increasing eagerness of West German companies, looking ahead to the reduction in European Community internal barriers in 1992, to get involved in what until now were considered internal French affairs.
Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank all also have expressed eagerness to expand in France before 1992. 

Dresdner Bank this month moved to acquire Banque Internationale des Placements, a small French merchant bank that Deutsche Bank had looked at and passed over.
Commerzbank had hoped to buy a stake in Credit Lyonnais, until the Socialists returned to government last year and canceled plans to privatize the large French bank.
Deutsche Bank has actively sought a French acquisition for at least two years.
Lately, analysts say, Deutsche Bank has shocked some in the French financial community by indicating it wants a strong bank with a large number of branches. 

"We are still looking," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman. "The banks we think would fit into our concept are either government-owned or not for sale, though Deutsche Bank would be able to pay a good price." 

While Allianz officials weren't willing to comment in any detail on their plans, they said Allianz currently holds between 5% and 10% of Navigation Mixte, an apparent increase from the 5% stake that Navigation Mixte officials had earlier announced.
Paris market sources said they believed Allianz was buying yesterday morning, and Navigation Mixte moved up 108 francs ($17.19) to close at 1,908 francs in heavy trading.
It was the first day of trading following the suspension of Navigation Mixte shares last Monday, when Paribas announced its plan to pay 1,850 francs for each Navigation Mixte share. 

Allianz also holds a 50% stake in Navigation Mixte's insurance subsidiary, one of France's largest insurance groups, which it bought for about 6.5 billion francs just before Paribas launched its bid.
Navigation Mixte holds the remaining 50%.
Allianz said in its statement that it was acting to protect that interest, which ties it to Navigation Mixte as a partner. 

Allianz's statement stressed the company's previously announced position that Paribas's offer price is too low.
Allianz also suggested, without saying so directly, that it regrets that Paribas isn't bidding for all of Navigation Mixte's shares.
The problem here, analysts say, is that if Paribas wins its 66.7%, remaining Navigation Mixte shares will fall in value.
That displeases many current holders, such as Allianz, which couldn't be sure of selling all their shares if they tendered to Paribas. 

The Allianz statement led to speculation that Allianz eventually could sell to Paribas.
That would be bad news for Navigation Mixte's current management, which was counting on Allianz to help fend off Paribas.
Allianz didn't say whom, if anyone, it will support.
It said simply that it will boost its Navigation Mixte stake as it sees fit over the coming days to protect itself, as long as it has French regulatory officials' approval. 

Paribas currently intends to offer 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that receive full dividends this year.
It is to offer 1,800 francs for shares created on July 1, which receive partial dividends.
Alternatively, it would offer to swap three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share.
Paribas already holds about 18.7% of Navigation Mixte, and the acquisition of the additional 48% would cost it about 11 billion francs under its current bid. 

The bid values Navigation Mixte at around 23 billion francs, depending on how many holders of Navigation Mixte warrants exchange them for shares before the bid expires. 

Hospital Regulation 

Sparks Kentucky Feud 

WHICH IS the best medicine for runaway health costs: competition or regulation? 

The question is at the root of a brawl between Humana Inc., the big for-profit hospital and insurance company, and its not-for-profit brethren in its home state of Kentucky. 

The battle focuses on the state's certificate-of-need law, which regulates investment in new medical technology.
The law has prevented $216 million of unnecessary expenditures since 1986, according to William S. Conn, president of the Kentucky Hospital Association. 

But according to David Jones, Humana's chief executive, it promotes technology monopolies, stifles innovation and raises prices. 

If the Legislature doesn't repeal the law, due for revision in 1990, Mr. Jones says Humana may move its insurance operations, including 3,000 jobs in Louisville, to another state. 

The company complains that it paid $10 million to non-Humana hospitals in its latest fiscal year for services provided to its insurance plan members.
But Humana says its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped. 

Mr. Conn charges that Humana's own actions undermine its argument.
When a hospital in Lexington installed a lithotripter last year, demand for a similar kidney-stone smashing machine at a Humana hospital in Louisville fell 34%.
The Humana hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue, Mr. Conn says, and now charges as much as $8,000 for the procedure, which costs only about $3,500 in Lexington. 

Humana contends that $8,000 represents an extreme case and that its regular charge for lithotripsy is $4,900. 

Meanwhile, another hospital's proposal for a new-generation lithotripter is pending before the board that administers the certificate-of-need law.
Humana, which wants to acquire one of the new machines itself, is on the record as opposed to the proposal. 

Debt-Burdened Doctors 

Seek Financial Security 

HEALTH-CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high-paying specialties instead of primary care, where more physicians are needed most. 

Now there's a new wrinkle in what young doctors want: More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said they'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their first professional position.
And 81% preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization, while just 11% favored solo practice. 

"Ten years ago, a physician would go to a town and take out a loan (to start a practice)," says James Merritt, president of Merritt, Hawkins & Associates, an Irvine, Calif., physician recruiter that conducted the survey. "They won't do that very often today at all.
They're looking for something that's very safe." 

The numbers behind such fears: The average debt of medical school graduates who borrowed to pay for their education jumped 10% to $42,374 this year from $38,489 in 1988, says the Association of American Medical Colleges.
That's 115% more than in 1981. 

Money isn't the only reason for the shift in practice preferences.
It reflects values of a generation that wants more time for families and personal interests, says John H. Moxley III, who directs physician-executive searches for Korn/Ferry International. "This is a change in the social fabric of medicine," he says. 

Related Roommates 

Trim Hospital Bills 

WHEN Catherine Bobar spent several weeks at the Medical Center of Vermont recently with a bone infection in her toe, she shared a room just like most patients. 

But unlike most patients, her roommate was her husband. "It was certainly good to have him handy," Mrs. Bobar says. 

The 12-bed "cooperative care" unit is one of about 18 nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital. "The philosophy is to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care," says Anthony J. Grieco, medical director of cooperative care at New York University Medical Center, where the concept began 10 years ago. "It helps us, and them, while they're here, and it certainly makes them a better health-care team when they get home." 

It also saves money.
Because patients require less attention from nurses and other staff, room charges are lower -- about $100 less per day than a regular room at the Vermont hospital. 

Cancer patients needing prolonged radiation therapy, diabetics learning to manage their blood sugar levels, and cardiac bypass patients are among those who spend time on cooperative-care units.
The approach has generated so much interest that NYU is host to the first conference on cooperative care Nov. 30. "It's really part of the hospital of the 21st century," Dr. Grieco says. 

Odds and Ends 

THE CHIEF NURSING officer can be responsible for more than 1,000 employees and at least one-third of a hospital's budget; a head nurse typically oversees up to 80 employees and $8 million.
So says the Commonwealth Fund, a New York philanthropist that's sponsoring a $1 million project to develop joint masters in business and nursing programs at 10 universities. . . . 

Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn., launches a new research publication in the spring: the Journal on Health Care for the Poor and Underserved. 

From a reading of the somewhat scant English-language medical literature on RU-486, the French abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around.
This is not only because it kills the unborn, a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient, zapping only 50% to 85% of them depending on which study you read (prostaglandin, taken in conjunction with the pill, boosts the rate to 95%).
By contrast, surgical abortion is 99% effective. 

Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion.
It is time-consuming (the abortion part alone lasts three days, and the clinical part comprises a week's worth of visits), bloody (one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion, although for most it resembles a menstrual period, with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days), and painful (many women require analgesic shots to ease them through).
Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects. 

Timing is of the essence with RU-486.
It is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her menstrual period up through the seventh week of pregnancy, when it is markedly less effective.
That is typically about a three-week window. 

So far, all the studies have concluded that RU-486 is "safe." But "safe," in the definition of Marie Bass of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, means "there's been no evidence so far of mortality." No one has researched the long-term effects of RU-486 on a woman's health or fertility. 

The drug seems to suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken.
Some women clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again: The studies have reported repeaters in their programs.
But there are no scientific data on this question. 

Rather ominously, rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects, Lancet, the British medical journal, reported in 1987.
However, Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu, the French physician who invented RU-486, wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys.
The drug has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES, the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it. 

All the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion.
A risk of birth defects, a sure source of lawsuits, is one reason the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of RU-486. 

One might well ask: Why bother with this drug at all?
Some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question.
RU-486 "probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed, or at least not very much," said Phillip Stubblefield, president of the National Abortion Federation, at a reproductive health conference in 1986.
Many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding, which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion. 

It typically takes from eight to 10 years to obtain the Food and Drug Administration's approval for a new drug, and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from $30 million to $70 million. 

The Health and Human Services Department currently forbids the National Institutes of Health from funding abortion research as part of its $8 million contraceptive program.
But the Population Council, a 37-year-old, $20 million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations and currently subsidizes most U.S. research on contraceptives, has recently been paying for U.S. studies of RU-486 on a license from its French developer, Roussel-Uclaf, a joint subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst and the French government. 

In the year since the pill went on the French market, the National Organization for Women and its offshoot, former NOW President Eleanor Smeal's Fund for a Feminist Majority, have been trying to browbeat the U.S. pharmaceutical industry into getting involved. (Its scare-tactic prediction: the pill "will be available in the U.S., either legally or illegally, in no more than 2-5 years.") 

Following the feminist and population-control lead has been a generally bovine press.
A June 1988 article in Mother Jones magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance. "For a woman whose period is late, using RU-486 means no waiting, no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics, and no feet up in stirrups for surgery," burbles health writer Laura Fraser. "It also means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant." Wrong on all counts, Miss Fraser. 

RU-486 is being administered in France only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor. (Roussel reportedly has every pill marked and accounted for to make sure none slips into the black market.) Thus, a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines; an initial visit for medical screening (anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated) and to take the pill, a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin, administered either via injection or vaginal suppository, and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted. 

Furthermore, because timing is so critical with RU-486, she will learn, via a pelvic examination and ultrasound, not only that she is pregnant, but just how pregnant she is.
No doctor who fears malpractice liability would likely expose a non-pregnant patient to the risk of hemorrhaging.
Many women may even see the dead embryo they have expelled, a sight the surgical-abortion industry typically spares them.
At seven weeks, an embryo is about three-fourths of an inch long and recognizably human. 

At the behest of pro-choice members of Congress, a four-year reauthorization bill for Title X federal family-planning assistance now contains a $10 million grant for "development, evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices, drugs and methods." If this passes -- a Senate version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year -- it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time.
It also could put the government into the RU-486 business, which would please feminists dismayed at what they view as pusillanimity in the private-sector drug industry. 

We do not know whether RU-486 will be as disastrous as some of the earlier fertility-control methods released to unblinking, uncritical cheers from educated people who should have known better. (Remember the Dalkon Shield and the early birth-control pills?) We will not know until a first generation of female guinea pigs -- all of whom will be more than happy to volunteer for the job -- has put the abortion pill through the clinical test of time.

Democracy is making a return with a vengeance to Latin America's most populous and deeply indebted country.
On Nov. 15, when Brazilians elect a president for the first time in 29 years, the country's 82 million voters will have 22 candidates to choose from. 

The candidates have been crisscrossing this huge country of 145 million people, holding rallies and televised debates in hope of being elected to what must be one of the world's most thankless political jobs: trying to drag Brazil out of its economic and social mess. 

"I feel sorry for whoever wins," says a Brazilian diplomat. 

Who that winner will be is highly uncertain.
A half-dozen candidates, backing policies ranging from Thatcherism to watered-down Marxism, are given a chance of winning. "Whoever says he knows which of the six will win is out of his mind," says Antonio Britto, a centrist member of Parliament. 

The favorite remains Fernando Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old former governor of the state of Alagoas.
He came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls, probably less because of his vague program to "build a new Brazil" than because of his good looks, the open backing of the powerful Rede Globo television network and his reputation as a hunter of "maharajahs," or overpaid and underworked civil servants. 

But after building up a commanding lead, the moderate to conservative Mr. Collor has slipped to about 30% in the polls from a high of about 43% only a few weeks ago.
To avoid a runoff, one candidate would have to win 50% of the vote -- a feat that most analysts consider impossible with so many candidates running. 

Two left-wing politicians, Socialist Leonel Brizola, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state, and Marxist-leaning Luis Inacio da Silva, currently are running neck and neck at about 15%, and three other candidates are given a chance of reaching the Dec. 17 runoff election between the two biggest vote-getters: Social Democrat Mario Covas and two conservatives, Paulo Salim Maluf, a former governor of the state of Sao Paulo, and Guilherme Afif Domingos. 

The uncertainty is sending shivers through Brazilian financial markets.
The dollar, the best indicator of the country's mood, has skyrocketed on the parallel market, as has gold.
Capital flight is reported to be strong. 

The big question is whether the new president will have the strength and the political support in Congress to take steps to cure Brazil's economic ills.
President Jose Sarney, who took office in 1985 when the man picked by an electoral college became critically ill, appears to be simply trying to avoid hyperinflation.
The unpopular Mr. Sarney, whose task was to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after 21 years of military rule, isn't seeking re-election. 

What comes out of the ballot box could be crucial in determining whether Brazil finally lives up to the potential of the world's eighth largest economy or keeps living up to its other, less enviable title: that of the developing world's largest debtor, teetering on the brink of hyperinflation, mired in deficits and stagnation, with huge economic inequalities and social discontent boiling under the surface. 

If Brazil devises an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt, this could lead it to open up and deregulate its sheltered economy, analysts say, just as Argentinian President Carlos Saul Menem has been doing even though he was elected on a populist platform. 

"Depending on the president, we could either be a trillion-dollar economy by the end of the century or stay where we are," says political scientist Amaury de Souza. "And where we are is bad." 

Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega, inflation came to 36% in September alone and is expected to top 1,000% for the year.
That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago, but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200% in July before bringing the rate down sharply in August and September. 

Still, massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2% to 3% a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper.
About $70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market, which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government. 

By some estimates, Brazil's internal debt, or combined public deficit, could reach 6.5% of its $351 billion gross domestic product. 

Much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping inefficient state-controlled companies operating.
Among the results is a frequent breakdown of public services.
It's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone, and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number.
Officials also say a national electricity shortage might not be far off.
Economists, businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending; focusing spending on vital areas such as education, health and welfare; turning state companies private; reforming the tax system, raising public service rates to match costs; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado. 

Analysts also say it's inevitable that Brazil will seek to renegotiate its $115 billion foreign debt, on which it suspended interest payments last month. 

Analysts say, however, that a tough economic program would have to be accompanied by measures to shield the poor from its recessionary effects, for instance by subsidizing staple food items.
About 80% of Brazil's voters are believed to live near the poverty level. 

Of the three candidates with a serious chance of winning, Mr. Collor comes closest to advocating the sort of measures that economists say are necessary.
But his inexperience raises doubts that he would have the political power to carry them out.
The 67-year-old Mr. Brizola has been vague about his intentions and often inflammatory in his rhetoric, but analysts say he probably would be pragmatic. 

Mr. da Silva, a 43-year-old former factory worker and labor leader, is the most radical, vowing to withhold payments on the foreign debt and saying he "wouldn't go around putting the country up for sale to the highest bidder." But despite the differences in what they say, according to some analysts here, economic constraints mean the next president may not have many choices about what he does. 

Interface Systems Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich., said it will report net income for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $470,000, or 11 cents a share, from $805,000, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. 

Chairman Carl L. Bixby said the decline occurred although revenue rose 30% to more than $8.3 million from $6.4 million a year earlier.
The company, which makes computer parts said fiscal 1989 earnings were "down slightly" from $3.2 million, or 74 cents a share, in fiscal l988. 

The company said fiscal 1989 revenue increased about 30% to more than $32 million from $25.3 million. 

Mr. Bixby said that early signs point to improved earnings and revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 1990. "The current backlog of orders is strong throughout the corporation," he said. 

Oh, that terrible Mr. Ortega.
Just when American liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the Contras and their friend Ronald Reagan, along comes Mr. Ortega in Costa Rica this weekend to "blunder" into the hands of what are often called conservatives.
Conservatives are the faction in U.S. politics which always said that Mr. Ortega and his friends don't want to hold an election in Nicaragua.
Liberals are the faction that says, Give peace a chance; now they are saying Mr. Ortega should give them a break, lest the conservatives ask them to vote for bullets instead of bandages. 

We suspect Daniel Ortega knows the difference between a blunder and a strategy.
He knows that making George Bush look silly in a photograph with him will trigger Noriegan fulminations, and that announcing an end to the liberals' cease-fire will produce mainly their concern over the Contras' military activities in northern Nicaragua.
Mr. Ortega understands better than those who worry about his behavior that what sustains the Sandinista movement is not democratic peace, but nondemocratic unpeace.
It is the presence of internal and external "enemies" which justifies the need for a large, active army that Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union continues to supply with bullets. 

A state judge postponed a decision on a move by holders of Telerate Inc. to block the tender offer of Dow Jones & Co. for the 33% of Telerate it doesn't already own. 

Vice Chancellor Maurice A. Hartnett III of Delaware's Court of Chancery heard arguments for more than two hours here, but he made no comment and asked no questions.
He could rule as early as today on the motion seeking a temporary injunction against the Dow Jones offer. 

Dow Jones has offered to pay $18 a share, or about $576 million, for the remaining Telerate stake.
The offer will expire at 5 p.m. EST on Nov. 6, unless extended again. 

Robert Kornreich, an attorney for the Telerate holders, told Judge Hartnett the Dow Jones offer is "arrogant" and "hostile." He accused Dow Jones of "using unfair means to obtain the stock at an unfair price." 

Michael Rauch, an attorney for Dow Jones, defended the offer as adequate, based on what the company considers realistic projections of Telerate's revenue growth, in the range of 12%.
He also contended that the plaintiffs failed to cite any legal authority that would justify such an injunction. 

Telerate provides information about financial markets through an electronic network.
Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services. 

Cetus Corp. said the government of Spain approved the marketing of its Proleukin interleukin-2 drug to treat kidney cancer. 

The biotechnology concern said Spanish authorities must still clear the price for the treatment, but that it expects to receive such approval by year end.
Four other countries in Europe have approved Proleukin in recent months.
Cetus is currently trying to obtain federal regulatory clearance for U.S. distribution. 

BROWN-FORMAN Corp. (Louisville, Ky.) -- David R. Jackson, formerly vice president, managing director of corporate communications for Maxwell Communication Inc., was named vice president and assistant to the chairman of this maker of alcoholic beverages and consumer products. 

The recently revived enthusiasm among small investors for stock mutual funds has been damped by a jittery stock market and the tumult over program trading. 

After hitting two-year highs this summer, net sales of stock funds slowed in September, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.
The sales recovery screeched to a halt this month, some analysts say. 

"Confidence was starting to come back because we didn't have wildly volatile days," says Tyler Jenks, research director for Kanon Bloch Carre & Co., a Boston research firm. "Now everything" -- such as program trading and wide stock market swings -- "that everyone had pushed back in their consciousness is just sitting right there." 

Net sales of stock funds in September totaled $839.4 million, down from $1.1 billion in August, the institute said.
But if reinvested dividends are excluded, investors put in only $340 million more than they pulled out for the month.
October's numbers, which won't be released for a month, are down further, mutual fund executives say. 

Investors in stock funds didn't panic the weekend after mid-October's 190-point market plunge.
Most of the those who left stock funds simply switched into money market funds.
And some fund groups said investors actually became net buyers. 

But the stock market swings have continued.
The recent outcry over program trading will cast a pall over the stock-fund environment in the coming months, some analysts say. 

"The public is very close to having had it," Mr. Jenks says. 

Investors pulled back from bond funds in September, too.
Net sales of bond funds for the month totaled $1.1 billion, down two-thirds from $3.1 billion in August.
The major reason: heavy outflows from high-risk, high-yield junk bond funds.
Big withdrawals from the junk funds have continued this month. 

Overall, net sales of all mutual funds, excluding money market funds, fell to $1.9 billion in September from $4.2 billion in August, the trade group said. "Small net inflows into stock and bond funds were offset by slight declines in the value of mutual fund stock and bond portfolios" stemming from falling prices, said Jacob Dreyer, the institute's chief economist. 

Many small investors went for the safety of money market funds.
Assets of these and other short-term funds surged more than $5 billion in September, the institute said.
Analysts say additional investors transferred their assets into money funds this month. 

At Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund group, money funds continue to draw the most business, says Michael Hines, vice president, marketing.
In October, net sales of stock funds at Fidelity dropped sharply, Mr. Hines said.
But he emphasized that new accounts, new sales, inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from September's level. 

Investor interest in stock funds "hasn't stalled at all," Mr. Hines maintains.
He notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed from a three-day period following the Friday the 13th plunge. 

"If that follows through next month, then it will be a different story," he says.
But, Mr. Hines adds, sales "based on a few days' events don't tell you much about October's trends." 

One trend that continues is growth in the money invested in funds.
Buoyed by the continued inflows into money funds, assets of all mutual funds swelled to a record $953.8 billion in September, up fractionally from $949.3 billion in August. 

Stock-fund managers, meantime, went into October with less cash on hand than they held earlier this year.
These managers held 9.8% of assets in cash at the end of September, down from 10.2% in August and 10.6% in September 1988.
Large cash positions help buffer funds from market declines but can cut down on gains in rising markets. 

Managers of junk funds were bolstering their cash hoards after the September cash crunch at Campeau Corp. Junk-portfolio managers raised their cash position to 9.4% of assets in September from 8.3% in August.
In September 1988, that level was 9.5%. 

Investors in all funds will seek safety in the coming months, some analysts say.
Among stock funds, the conservative growth-and-income portfolios probably will remain popular, fund specialists say. 

"There will be a continuation and possibly greater focus on conservative equity funds, at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds," says Avi Nachmany, an analyst at Strategic Insight, a New York fund-research concern. 

Sherwin-Williams Co. and Whittaker Corp. said they've discontinued talks toward a definitive agreement regarding Sherwin-Williams' acquisition of Whittaker's chemical coating group.
The companies reached an agreement in principle for the sale in August.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Cleveland-based Sherwin-Williams produces paints and coatings, while the Los Angeles-based Whittaker coatings group produces industrial coatings. 

New construction contracting climbed 8% in September to an annualized $274.2 billion, with commercial, industrial and public-works contracts providing most of the increase, according to F.W. Dodge Group. 

Through the first nine months of the year, the unadjusted total of all new construction was $199.6 billion, flat compared with a year earlier.
The South was off 2% after the first nine months, while the North Central region was up 3%.
The Northeast and West regions were unchanged. 

A small decline in total construction for the entire year is possible if contracting for housing doesn't increase in response to this year's lower mortgage rates, said George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist of Dodge, the forecasting division of publisher McGraw-Hill Inc. 

The seasonally adjusted Dodge Index reached 175 in September, its highest level this year, from 162 in August.
The index uses a base of 100 in 1982. 

Newly contracted residential work edged up 2% in September to an annualized $121.2 billion, largely because multifamily building rebounded from a very weak August. 

"At the end of the third quarter, there was still no evidence of renewed home building in response to the midyear decline of mortgage rates," Mr. Christie said.
Housing has been weak all year and especially so in the past five months. 

Contracting for non-residential buildings rose 10% in September to an annualized $100.8 billion.
Commercial and industrial construction rose sharply, partly because of three large projects, each expected to cost more than $100 million.
Institutional building, such as hospitals and schools, eased in September following a surge in August. 

Although the third quarter was the best so far this year for non-residential building, weakness early in the year held the nine-month total to $69.6 billion, up just 1% from a year earlier. 

Public-works and utility projects, also known as non-building contracting, grew 18% to $52.2 billion in September, but the nine-month total of $36.9 billion was down 3% from a year earlier. 

The Sept. 30 end of the federal fiscal year may have prodded contractors to get any behind-schedule road and bridge construction under way "before the clock ran out," Mr. Christie said, referring to threatened 5% across-the-board budget cuts. 

a-Monthly construction contract values are reported on an annualized, seasonally adjusted basis. 

Mitsui & Co. said it started a joint venture with Dae Woong Chemical Co., a major pharmaceutical manufacturer in South Korea, to manufacture antibiotic medicines.
The new company is capitalized at about $3.5 million. 

Mitsui expects the antibiotic products to be exported to Southeast Asia and Africa.
It also hopes to enter the U.S. market. 

WPP GROUP'S Ogilvy & Mather expects profit margins to improve to 11.5% in 1990 in the U.S. Yesterday's edition didn't specify where the improvement would take place.

The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. may require LTV Corp. to reassume funding responsibility for a $2.3 billion shortfall in the company's pension plans. 

The high court's decision, expected next spring, may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency. 

The agency, which is funded through insurance premiums from employers, insures pension benefits for some 30 million private-sector workers who take part in single-employer pension plans.
It recently reported assets of $2.4 billion and liabilities of $4 billion. 

In its appeal to the high court, the agency said the federal appeals court ruling, which favored LTV, threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an "open-ended source of industry bailouts." 

The ruling also may determine how quickly LTV is able to complete its Chapter 11 reorganization.
LTV filed for protection under Chapter 11 in federal bankruptcy court in 1986.
The filing was partly the result of the $2.3 billion shortfall in LTV's three pension plans operated for its LTV Steel Co. subsidiary's employees. 

In January 1987, as LTV Steel continued operating while under reorganization, the agency terminated the three LTV pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing.
Termination means that the agency's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans, but workers don't accrue new benefits. 

A few months later, under pressure from the United Steelworkers of America, LTV instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans.
Because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans, LTV would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans. 

But the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the $2.3 billion shortfall from LTV to federal insurance.
The agency also concluded that LTV's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization.
In September 1987, it ordered LTV to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans. 

LTV challenged the order, and a federal district court in New York in June 1988 ruled that the agency improperly ordered LTV to reassume responsibility for the plans. 

In May, a federal appeals court in New York agreed that the agency acted unlawfully.
The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans.
The appeals court also said the agency had to consider a company's long-term ability to fund pension plans, not just short-term improved financial status. 

In Dallas, LTV said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the move will further delay its Chapter 11 proceedings.
The company hasn't been able to come up with a reorganization plan, in part, because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency. 

But LTV, a steel, aerospace and energy concern, said it is confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed. (Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. vs.

Warner Communications Inc. is close to an agreement to back a new recorded music and music publishing company in partnership with Irving Azoff, who resigned in September as head of MCA Inc. 's MCA Records unit. 

Warner and Mr. Azoff declined comment, as did MCA, where Mr. Azoff had also been discussing such a venture.
But record industry executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Azoff and Warner came to an agreement yesterday to form a 50-50 joint-venture company funded by Warner and run by Mr. Azoff.
Among other things, they said, Mr. Azoff would develop musical acts for a new record label. 

The agreement is said to be similar to Warner's 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer David Geffen, whose films and records are distributed by the Warner Bros. studio and the Warner records unit.
Although Mr. Azoff won't produce films at first, it is possible that he could do so later, the sources said. 

Like Mr. Geffen's arrangement, the venture gives Mr. Azoff a link to the world's largest and most successful record distributor; in the U.S. alone, Warner has a 40% share of the market, about double its nearest competitor, Sony Corp. 's CBS Records.
For Warner, meanwhile, it gives the company a second young partner with a finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in the music business. 

The 41-year-old Mr. Azoff, a former rock `n' roll manager, is credited with turning around MCA's once-moribund music division in his six years at the company.
But Mr. Azoff had been negotiating for more than a year to get out of his MCA contract, which expired in 1991.
Mr. Azoff reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top MCA management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans. 

Mr. Azoff also was eager to return to a more entrepreneurial role in which he had a big financial stake in his own efforts.
In an interview at the time of his resignation from MCA, he said: "I'd rather build a company than run one." 

Fletcher Challenge Ltd. said its Petrocorp unit agreed to acquire certain Alberta oil and gas interests from Amoco Corp. 's Canadian unit, for about 130 million Canadian dollars (US$110.6 million). 

Fletcher Challenge, a big New Zealand-based forest products concern with forestry operations in Canada, said the assets include stakes in four natural gas fields and one oil field near Provost, Alberta, plus gas processing facilities and about 247,000 acres of undeveloped land.
The proposed purchase requires approval from Investment Canada, which monitors large foreign investments in Canada. 

Amoco Canada Petroleum Co., which operates the major properties included in the asset package, said the sale is part of a plan to streamline its assets. 

Petrocorp, a New Zealand-based oil and gas producer, said the planned purchase would be its first oil and gas acquisition outside its home country, and would form the basis for a new stand-alone exploration and production unit in Canada.

Owings, Md. 

The American Stock Exchange said a seat was sold for $160,000, down $5,000 from the previous sale last Friday. 

Seats are currently quoted at $151,000, bid, and $162,000, asked. 

Giant Group said a federal court in Delaware has denied a motion by Rally's Inc. seeking to block a group led by Giant Chairman Burt Sugarman from acquiring more of the company's shares. 

Rally's, a fast-food chain based in Louisville, Ky., is contending that Mr. Sugarman and two other company directors failed to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission that they intended to acquire a big Rally stake. 

Mr. Sugarman has in turn contended that the other major shareholder group -- whose interests are represented by three other directors connected to trusts in the name of the children of the company's founder, James Patterson -- has ties to a competing fast food chain, Wendy's International Inc. 

The company last week assembled a three-member committee of directors aligned with neither side to analyze the situation.
Each group controls more than 40% of Rally's stock.
The company just went public earlier this month. 

Rally's had no comment, but was expected to make an announcement this morning about the situation. 

When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives a year later, some Western observers assumed Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy.
Their only doubt concerned the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed. 

If Mr. Gorbachev's goal is the creation of a free market, he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future, as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest.
These fears were clearly apparent when, last week, Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert, on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms succeeding. 

Yet the Soviet leader's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power, particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30, do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika.
Indeed, the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform.
But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill?
And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will, sooner or later, lead to its demise? 

An alternative and more convincing explanation, confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program, is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market.
For example, while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state, strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market.
Before becoming self-employed, or setting up a cooperative, workers must seek permission from the local soviet (council).
Permission is far from automatic: The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions, and they appear to be exercising these powers.
Private dressmaking, for example, is allowed in 10 Soviet republics but banned by five; shoemaking is allowed in seven but illegal in nine. 

The controls on cooperatives appeared relatively liberal when first introduced.
But that changed following a resolution from the Supreme Soviet banning cooperatives from operating in some areas of the economy, and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state. 

All independent media activity is now illegal, which perhaps is not surprising, but so is the manufacture of perfume, cosmetics, household chemicals and sand candles.
Medical cooperatives, among the most successful in the U.S.S.R., are banned from providing general-practitioner services (their main source of income), carrying out surgery, and treating cancer patients, drug addicts and pregnant women. 

Earlier this month, the Supreme Soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives: The first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold; the second bans cooperatives from buying "industrial and food goods" from the state or other cooperatives.
If Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market, these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless. 

Along with some other revealing indicators, these developments suggest that while Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls, he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought.
Mr. Gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods.
He told the Congress of People's Deputies on May 30: "We do not share this approach, since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country." 

Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons, and the market for fear of the social (political) consequences, Mr. Gorbachev seeks a "third way" that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter.
Most important, this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely undisturbed.
Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism, whose architects spoke specifically of a "third way": of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism.
They, too, promised to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline. 

The emergence of Russian corporatism had been anticipated in journalist George Urban's introduction to a series of colloquies -- "Can the Soviet System Survive Reform?" -- published this spring. "Communism will reach its final stage of development in a feckless Russo -- corporation-socialist in form, nationalistic in content and Oriental in style -- that will puzzle the world with alternating feats of realism and recklessness. . . ." 

The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an "organic" society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified, and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation.
This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and "harmonic" society.
The key to the creation of the "organic" state lay in the formation of "natural" groups that would undertake the role of decision-making.
By contrast, a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause, rather than resolve, conflict. 

The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress.
In doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market.
Instead, he proposed a "law-governed economy," in which there would be a "clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management." The latter would be undertaken by "enterprises, joint stock companies and cooperatives." These would not function independently, but would act together to form "combines, unions and associations" to tackle problems and coordinate their activities. 

Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was Mussolini, who was never able to influence business giants such as Pirelli and Fiat.
The Soviet Communist Party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it. 

To ensure the loyalty of the business sector, Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests, probably by restricting competition.
However, Mr. Gorbachev must ensure that within this "alliance" the business sector remains subordinate to the party.
At the same time, he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed.
It is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor. 

The work force provides the third arm of the "alliance." Within the alliance it is supposed to act as a balancing force, guarding against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business, for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards (under the new resolutions, workers councils may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced).
By providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher, and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods, Mr. Gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party. 

At the same time, the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine Western-style political pluralism.
The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism.
An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R., particularly the Democratic Union, allege that they show "terroristic tendencies" and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims.
It is possible that, in perpetuating such myths, the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism. 

Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task, however, as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor, capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo.
If he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system, he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition, and to re-establish control in Eastern Europe. 

The weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations -- Mr. Gorbachev is a consummate political leader, perhaps one of the greatest -- but in its economic prescription.
Contrary to widespread belief, Mussolini failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time; it is doubtful whether Soviet-style corporatism will make Soviet trains run on time, or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately crave.

Medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which, if damaged, unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer. 

Scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops.
An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention. 

That is for the future.
Already, scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that, for the first time, can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer. 

"It's a super-exciting set of discoveries," says Bert Vogelstein, a Johns Hopkins University researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer. "Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level.
Today, we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and, then, propel it into a deadly state." 

Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors, or simply anti-cancer genes.
When functioning normally, they make proteins that hold a cell's growth in check.
But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation, a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work, and cells normally under control turn malignant. 

The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes.
Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant, but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells, suggesting that oncogenes don't cause cancer by themselves.
In recent months, researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged. 

Like all genes, tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies, one from each parent.
Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth, so for cancer to arise, both copies must be impaired.
A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or in whom one copy is damaged early in life, is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop. 

Emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such cancer-susceptible individuals, ushering in what some scientists believe is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis. 

Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings.
The Dedham, Mass., couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births.
Mr. Quinlan, 30 years old, knew he carried a damaged gene, having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old -- after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby. 

Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, it became possible last January to find out what threat the Quinlan baby faced.
A test using new "genetic probes" showed that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and, therefore, faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer. "It made our New Year," says Mr. Quinlan. 

This test was the first to predict reliably whether an individual could expect to develop cancer.
Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth, made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja, has opened a field of cancer study, which in recent months has exploded. "It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer," says Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute. "All this may not be obvious to the public, which is concerned about advances in treatment, but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon." 

To date, scientists have fingered two of these cancer-suppressors.
Dr. Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986.
Then last spring, researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which, if impaired, turns healthy colon cells cancerous. 

Soon after that report, two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers.
Colon, lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease, collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year.
Right now about a dozen laboratories, in the U.S., Canada and Britain, are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes.
They have about seven candidates.
Researchers say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, alone or in combination, appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix.
There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes, they are especially prone to cancer, perhaps explaining, finally, why some cancers seem to haunt certain families. 

The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s, when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects.
He theorized that in the eye cancer, an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other.
The tumor, he suggested, developed when the second, normal copy also was damaged.
But there was no way to prove Dr. Knudson's "two-hit" theory. 

Back then, scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes, but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes.
Occasionally, gross chromosome damage was visible.
Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease.
Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing.
He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer.
But he didn't know which gene or genes had disappeared. 

Then, a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, then at the University of Utah, found the answer.
The team used a battery of the newly developed "gene probes," snippets of genetic material that can track a gene's presence in a cell.
By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors, they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome. 

The finding riveted medicine.
It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer. "It was extraordinarily satisfying," says Dr. Knudson, now at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia. "I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers." 

It was an audacious claim.
But in Baltimore, Dr. Vogelstein, a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, believed Dr. Knudson was right, and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers.
His was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm's tumor. 

Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer.
He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple "hits" on cancer suppressor genes, because it often seems to develop in stages.
It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel, which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring. 

Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student, Eric Fearon, began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage.
They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions, some existing only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells.
Gradually, a coherent picture of cancer development emerged.
If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out, benign polyps would develop.
If both copies of a second gene were then deleted, the polyps would progress to malignancy.
It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop. 

Their report galvanized other molecular biologists. "It was the confirming evidence we all needed that {gene} losses were critical to the development of a common tumor," says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City. 

But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that, if damaged, flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy.
They focused on chromosome 17.
For months the Johns Hopkins researchers, using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17, looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells.
Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene. 

When they found it last winter, Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over.
His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones.
The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53.
But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth, whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth. 

Despite that, when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. Levine's p53 gene they found the two were identical; it turned out that in Mr. Levine's cancer studies, he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene. 

The discovery "suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation," says Robert Weinberg, a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass. 

Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers, too.
Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies.
The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families, the gene, when inherited in a damaged form, may predispose women to the cancer. 

The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer.
In a report out last week, John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene. 

There also are reports from several labs, as yet unpublished, of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney, brain and skin cancers. 

At the same time, the Johns Hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes.
Dr. Vogelstein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18, also involved in colon cancer.
Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer, a researcher in Great Britain, are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer, thought to be on chromosome 5. 

Dr. Minna believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer.
Recently, he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers, as well as several other more common cancers, too. 

Where these discoveries will lead, scientists can only speculate.
Already two major pharmaceutical companies, the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, maybe, new therapies. 

Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes.
The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes.
It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions, though no one has come close to doing that so far. 

In any case, says Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute, "We're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer." 

Copper futures prices failed to extend Friday's rally.
Declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down. 

The December contract was down three cents a pound, settling at $1.1280, which was just above the day's low of $1.1270. 

Futures prices fell during three of five sessions last week, and the losses, individually and cumulatively, were greater than the advances. 

Two of the major factors buoying prices, the prolonged strikes at the Highland Valley mine in Canada and the Cananea mine in Mexico, were finally resolved.
Also, the premiums paid by the U.S. government on a purchase of copper for the U.S. Mint were lower than expected, and acted as a price depressant, analysts said.
The mint purchases were at premiums about 4 1/2 cents a pound above the respective prices for the copper.
At the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound. 

All this has led to prolonged selling in futures, mostly on the part of computer-guided funds.
Prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas, which added to the selling. 

The reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply.
At least one analyst noted that as production improves, the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies. 

"Demand from Japan is expected to continue strong, but not from other areas of the world into the first quarter of next year," he said. 

Japan normally depends heavily on the Highland Valley and Cananea mines as well as the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea.
Recently, Japan has been buying copper elsewhere.
But as Highland Valley and Cananea begin operating, they are expected to resume their roles as Japan's suppliers.
According to Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, New York, "Highland Valley has already started operating and Cananea is expected to do so soon." 

The Bougainville mine is generally expected to remain closed until at least the end of the year.
It hasn't been operating since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners.
A recent attempt to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks. 

However, traders disregarded a potential production disruption in Chile and a continued drop in inventories. 

Workers at two Chilean mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputado group, will vote Thursday on whether to strike after a two-year labor pact ends today.
The mines produced a total of 110,000 tons of copper in 1988. 

According to Drexel's Mr. Demler, the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly, which may be one reason why the situation didn't affect prices much.
Another analyst said that, if there was any concern, it was that a strike could encourage other walkouts in Chile. 

London Metal Exchange copper inventories fell 550 tons last week to 83,950 tons, a smaller-than-expected decline.
But that development also had little effect on traders' sentiment. 

Mr. Demler said that stocks of copper in U.S. producers' hands at the end of September were down 16,000 metric tons from August to 30,000 tons.
Outside the U.S., he said, producer stocks at the end of August were 273,000 tons, down 3,000 tons from the end of July. 

Consumer stocks of copper in the U.S. fell to 44,000 tons at the end of September from 54,000 tons a month earlier, and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the U.S. at the end of July stood at 123,000 tons, down from 125,000 tons in June.
The high point of foreigners' copper stocks this year was 136,000 tons at the end of April, according to Mr. Demler. 

In other commodity markets yesterday: 

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The prices of most corn, soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the Midwest continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the 1988 drought.
Buying by the Soviets has helped to prop up corn prices in recent weeks, but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums. 

COFFEE: Futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved.
The December contract ended with a gain of 1.29 cents a pound at 74.35 cents.
According to one analyst, prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that Brazil and Colombia, at the Pan-American summit meeting in Costa Rica, had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement.
The reports, attributed to the Colombian minister of economic development, said Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags, the analyst said.
These reports were later denied by a high Brazilian official, who said Brazil wasn't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas, the analyst said.
The Colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said President Bush sent to Colombian President Virgilio Barco, and in which President Bush said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement.
The minister was also quoted as saying that a new pact could be achieved during the first half of next year, according to the analyst. 

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices showed modest changes in light trading volume.
December delivery gold eased 40 cents an ounce to $380.80.
December silver was off 3.7 cents an ounce at $5.2830.
January platinum rose 90 cents an ounce at $500.20.
The market turned quiet after rising sharply late last week, according to one analyst.
Last week's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety, he said, but yesterday the market lacked such stimuli.
There was some profit-taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance, he said.
The dollar was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling, as well, according to the analyst. 

Bancroft Convertible Fund Inc., New York, likely will reject a renewed offer from Florida investor Robert I. Green to buy Bancroft for $18.95 a share. 

Sigmund Levine, Bancroft secretary and treasurer, said the closed-end fund's directors will consider Mr. Green's offer in a couple of weeks at a regular meeting. "He hasn't added anything," Mr. Levine said, predicting the board will again reject Mr. Green's proposal. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Green said he had boosted his holdings in Bancroft common to 10.4% from 8.5%, and renewed an offer he made in March to acquire the fund. 

Mr. Levine noted that Bancroft's shares have been trading at or above Mr. Green's offering price for the last several months. 

He said Bancroft attorneys are scheduled to meet with Mr. Green's attorneys in Delaware Chancery Court at the end of this week to respond to the investor's request for company records for the past five years.
Mr. Green couldn't be reached. 

Vernon E. Jordan was elected to the board of this transportation services concern.
Mr. Jordan has served as executive director of the United Negro College Fund, director of the Voter Education Project of the Southern Regional Council and attorney-consultant to the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity.
His election increases Ryder's board to 14 members. 

Warner Communications Inc. and Sony Corp. resumed settlement talks on their legal battle over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters, but continued to level strong accusations at each other in legal documents. 

Warner has filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Sony and the Guber-Peters duo, who in turn are countersuing Warner for trying to interfere in Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber Peters Entertainment Co. in two transactions valued at over $5 billion. 

Although settlement talks had been dropped, attorneys for the two sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an attempt to settle the matter before Thursday, when a judge is expected to rule on Warner's request for an injunction that would block the two producers from taking over the management of Columbia.
Yesterday, in documents filed in connection with that case, Warner accused Sony officials of falsely claiming that they never read the five-year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for Columbia, citing Securities and Exchange Commission filings made by Sony that described the contracts. 

Warner was referring to documents filed last week in which Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof and Walter Yetnikoff, president of its CBS Records unit, said they had taken Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement. 

Wayne Smith, an attorney at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles representing Sony, said the Sony executives hadn't seen the contract because "it wasn't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time." Mr. Smith said statements about the contract made in SEC filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who weren't part of the negotiations between Sony and the duo. 

Warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by Messrs.
Guber and Peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with Warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come up.
But Mr. Smith said Sony intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist, and that even the existing written contract doesn't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio. 

Warner described as "nonsense" yesterday Sony's assertions in prior court filings that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters could in theory run Columbia while still fulfilling their contract to produce movies for Warner.
Such a dual role would be "impractical and unethical," Warner said, adding, "that concept is as silly as suggesting that the head coach of the Los Angeles Dodgers could simultaneously be general manager of the San Francisco Giants." 

Warner, which is in the process of being acquired by New York-based Time Warner Inc., also said it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of $3 million. 

Gen-Probe Inc., a biotechnology concern, said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Tokyo for about $110 million, or almost double the market price of Gen-Probe's stock. 

The move is sure to heighten concerns about increased Japanese investment in U.S. biotechnology firms.
It is also likely to bolster fears that the Japanese will use their foothold in U.S. biotechnology concerns to gain certain trade and competitive advantages. 

Gen-Probe, an industry leader in the field of genetic probes, which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests, last year signed an agreement for Chugai to exclusively market its diagnostic products in Japan for infectious diseases and cancer.
Chugai agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs. 

That arrangement apparently has worked well, and Thomas A. Bologna, president and chief executive officer of Gen-Probe, founded in 1983, said the sale of the company means "we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing." Chugai agreed to pay $6.25 a share for Gen-Probe's 17.6 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. 

Yesterday, in national trading in the over-the-counter market, Gen-Probe common closed at $3.25 a share. 

Because the U.S. leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the U.S. government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy American know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition. 

"The biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors," said Richard Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology Association.
He added that until now the Japanese have only acquired equity positions in U.S. biotechnology companies. "They are piggybacking onto developed technology," he said.
During the past five years, Japanese concerns have invested in several of the U.S.'s 431 independent biotechnology companies.
Chugai has been one of the most active Japanese players in U.S. biotechnology companies; it has an equity investment in Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., and a joint-venture agreement with Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich. 

The Japanese government, Mr. Godown said, has stated that it wants 10% to 11% of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products. "It is becoming more of a horse race every day between the U.S. and Japan," he said, adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor, electronics, and automobile industries, Japanese companies will use U.S.-developed technology to gain trade advantages. 

Mr. Bologna said the sale would allow Gen-Probe to speed up the development of new technology, and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the company wants to offer. 

By 1988, when only 10 genetic probe-based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration, eight of them had been developed and sold by Gen-Probe. 

Osamu Nagayama, deputy president of Chugai, which spends about 15% of its sales on research and development, was unable to pinpoint how much money Chugai would pump into Gen-Probe. "We think Gen-Probe has technology important to people's health," he said, adding: "We think it is important for us to have such technology." He and Mr. Bologna emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of Gen-Probe, which will expand "significantly" as a result of the acquisition. 

In 1988, Chugai had net income of $60 million on revenue of $991 million.
GenProbe had a net loss of $9.5 million on revenue of $5.8 million.
Recently, Gen-Probe received a broad U.S. patent for a technology that helps detect, identify and quantify non-viral organisms through the targeting of a form of genetic material called ribosomal RNA. 

Among other things, Mr. Bologna said that the sale will facilitate Gen-Probe's marketing of a diagnostic test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. 

Chugai also will help Gen-Probe with its regulatory and marketing expertise in Asia, Mr. Bologna said.
The tender offer for Gen-Probe's shares is expected to begin next Monday, the company said. 

The Oakland Athletics' four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants in the World Series may widen already-sizable losses that the ABC network will incur on the current, final year of its baseball contract. 

The 1989 Series, disrupted by a devastating earthquake and diminished in national interest because both teams came from the San Francisco Bay area, is likely to end up as the lowest-rated Series of this decade and probably since the event has been broadcast. 

The first three games were seen by an average of only 17% of U.S. homes, a sharp decline from the 23.7% rating for last year's Series.
A final ratings tally from A.C. Nielsen Co. is due today. 

The sweep by the A's, whose pitchers and home-run hitters dominated the injury-prone Giants, will only make things worse for ABC, owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
The network had been expected to have losses of as much as $20 million on baseball this year. 

It isn't clear how much those losses may widen because of the short Series.
Had the contest gone a full seven games, ABC could have reaped an extra $10 million in ad sales on the seventh game alone, compared with the ad take it would have received for regular prime-time shows. 

ABC had based its budget for baseball on a six-game Series. 

A network spokesman wouldn't comment, and ABC Sports officials declined to be interviewed.
But some industry executives said ABC, in anticipation of a four-game sweep, limited its losses by jacking up the number of commercials it aired in the third and fourth games.
A World Series telecast typically carries 56 30-second commercials, but by the fourth game ABC was cramming in 60 to 62 ads to generate extra revenue. 

ABC's baseball experience may be of interest to CBS Inc., which next season takes over the broadcasting of all baseball playoffs in a four-year television contract priced at $1.06 billion.
CBS Sports President Neal Pilson has conceded only that CBS will have a loss in the first year.
But other industry executives contend the losses could reach $250 million over four years and could go even higher if the World Series end in four-game romps. 

The Series typically is among the highest-rated sports events on television.
Last year's series, broadcast by General Electric Co. 's NBC, was the lowest-rated Series in four years; instead of featuring a major East Coast team against a West Coast team, it pitted the Los Angeles Dodgers against the losing Oakland A's. 

ABC's hurdle was even higher this year with two teams from the same area.
The Series got off to a lukewarm start Oct. 14 with a 16.2% rating; the next night it drew 17.4% of homes.
Then came the earthquake and a damaging delay of 11 days. 

Some people had hoped ABC's ratings would go up because of the intense focus on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake.
An analyst's opinion to that effect even sent Capital Cities/ABC shares soaring two weeks ago.
But interest instead decreased.
The third game, last Friday night, drew a disappointing 17.5 rating. 

The Treasury Department proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers, which officials believe is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the U.S. 

In recent testimony on Capitol Hill, Treasury officials said they were considering the new reporting requirements, and the expected publication of the proposal in the Federal Register today is the first official step toward creating final regulations.
The Treasury is still working out the details with bank trade associations and the other government agencies that have a hand in fighting money laundering. 

Among the possibilities the Treasury is considering are requirements that banks keep records identifying the originators and recipients of international wire transfers.
Another suggestion would draw banks more directly into tracking down money launderers by developing a "suspicious international wire transfer profile," which banks would use to spotlight questionable payments.
But banks may prefer using a profile that targets selected transactions, rather than a blanket reporting requirement. 

Banks now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of $10,000 or more.
But wire transfers from a standing account -- including those bigger than $10,000 -- aren't reported.
Officials believe this has left a gaping loophole that illegal drug businesses are exploiting.
Authorities estimate that revenues from illegal drugs in the U.S. total about $110 billion annually. 

Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that oversees the issue of money laundering, criticized the proposal for ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that are executed and cleared on U.S. wire systems.
The American Bankers Association didn't have any comment on the plan.
The proposal now enters a 60-day comment period, after which the Treasury will propose final regulations, followed by another comment period. 

Boeing Co. 's third-quarter profit leaped 68%, but Wall Street's attention was focused on the picket line, not the bottom line. 

In fact, the earnings report unfolded as representatives of the world's No. 1 jet maker and the striking Machinists union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two weeks.
Doug Hammond, the federal mediator in Seattle, where Boeing is based, said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again. 

Despite the progress, Boeing indicated that the work stoppage, now in its 27th day, will have "a serious adverse impact" on the current quarter. 

For the third quarter, net rose to $242 million, or $1.05 a share, from $144 million, or 63 cents a share.
Sales climbed 71% to $6.36 billion from $3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners. 

Because it's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last, the precise impact on Boeing's sales, earnings, cash flow and short-term investment position couldn't be determined. 

The investment community, however, strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either Boeing or its work force.
The company's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at Sept. 30 stood at a mighty $69.1 billion, compared with $53.6 billion at the end of 

Although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $5 billion if it isn't able to deliver any more planes this year, those dollars actually would just be deferred until 1990.
And the company is certain to get out some aircraft with just supervisors and other non-striking employees on hand. 

Before the union rejected the company's offer and the strike was launched with the graveyard shift of Oct. 4, Boeing had been counting on turning 96 aircraft out the door in the present period.
That included 21 of the company's 747-400 jumbo jets, its most successful product. 

"It's not a pretty picture," said David Smith, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates. "But it would just mean a great first and second quarter next year." 

Phillip Brannon of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets added: "You don't want to minimize this and say nobody is looking at it.
But the strike hasn't gone on long enough for Boeing to lose business in any real sense." 

That's the primary reason the company's share price has held up so well when, in Mr. Smith's words, "most companies would have unraveled" by now.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Boeing closed yesterday at $54.50 a share, off a scant 12.5 cents. 

Still, Boeing went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside.
In a statement, Chairman Frank Shrontz asserted that the company "faces significant challenges and risks," on both its commercial and government contracts. 

For instance, he noted that spending on Pentagon programs is shrinking, and Boeing is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects, including the B-2 Stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Air Force's next-generation tactical fighter.
Because of cost overruns on fixed-price military work, Mr. Shrontz said, the company's defense business will record "a significant loss" in 1989. 

Moreover, Mr. Shrontz added, production-rate increases that have been implemented on the 737, 747, 757 and 767 programs have resulted in "serious work force skill-dilution problems." Suppliers and subcontractors are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules. 

And, of course, there's the unsteady labor situation.
Besides the Machinists pact, accords representing 30,000 of the company's engineering and technical employees in the Puget Sound and Wichita, Kan., areas expire in early December.
Also, a contract with the United Auto Workers at the company's helicopter plant in Philadelphia expired Oct. 15.
This contract, covering about 3,000 hourly production and maintenance workers, is being extended on a day-to-day basis. 

The Machinists rejected a proposal featuring a 10% base wage increase over the life of the three-year contract, plus bonuses of 8% the first year and 3% the second.
On top of that, Boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be 5% for each year of the contract. 

The union, though, has called the offer "insulting." The company reiterated yesterday that it's willing to reconfigure the package, but not add to the substance of it. 

For the nine months, Boeing's net increased 36% to $598 million, or $2.60 a share, from $440 million, or $1.92 a share.
Sales soared 28% to $15.43 billion from $12.09 billion. 

In a separate matter, the Justice Department yesterday said Boeing agreed to pay the government $11 million to settle claims that the company provided inaccurate cost information to the Air Force while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum skins on the KC-135 tanker aircraft. 

The settlement relates to four contracts negotiated from 1982 to 1985, prosecutors said.
They added that the settlement is the culmination of a 2 1/2-year investigation into the company's aluminum pricing practices in connection with KC-135s. 

A Boeing spokesman responded: "All along the company has said there was no grounds for criminal prosecution.
That was borne out by the Justice Department's decision" to settle the case. 

Many investors give Michael Foods about as much chance of getting it together as Humpty Dumpty.
But now at least there's a glimmer of hope for the stock. 

Burger King, which breaks thousands of fresh eggs each morning, is quietly switching over to an alternative egg product made by Michael Foods.
Known as Easy Eggs, the product has disappointed investors.
When the company this month announced lower-than-forecast sales of Easy Eggs, the stock dropped nearly 19%. 

Michael won't confirm the identities of any Easy Egg customers, nor will it say much of anything else.
Two Minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making "various untrue statements." These federal-court suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that Easy Eggs were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of Michael's production capacity. 

But at least Burger King has signed on, and says that by year end it won't be using any shell eggs.
The Miami fast-food chain, owned by Grand Metropolitan of Britain, expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of liquefied eggs annually. 

So there is reason to believe that Michael's hopes for a bacteria-free, long-shelf-life egg weren't all hype. (Easy Eggs are pasteurized in a heat-using process.) Still, caution is advisable.
A company official says Michael's break-even volume on Easy Eggs is around 60 million pounds a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested was a billion-pound market waiting for such a product.
Perhaps to debunk the analysts' talk of over-capacity, Michael today will take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new Gaylord, Minn., plant. 

There has been no announcement of the Burger King arrangement by either party, possibly for fear that McDonald's and other fast-food rivals would seize on it in scornful advertising.
But Burger King operators independently confirm using Michael's product.
Other institutional users reportedly include Marriott, which is moving away from fresh eggs on a region-by-region basis.
The extent of Marriott's use isn't known, and Marriott officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

Michael Foods has attracted a good many short-sellers, the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender.
Many analysts question management's credibility. 

"The stock, in my opinion, is going to go lower, not only because of disappointing earnings but {because} the credibility gap is certainly not closing," says L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth. 

Mr. Carver says that at a recent Dain-sponsored conference in New York, he asked Michael's chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down.
The CEO, Richard G. Olson, replied "yes," but wouldn't elaborate. (The company didn't put out a public announcement.
A spokesman said later that Mr. Olson was being "conservative" in his estimate.
But the spokesman added that while Michael will earn less than last year's $1.20 a share, it thinks Street estimates of $1 or so are low.) 

Analyst Robin Young of John Kinnard & Co., Minneapolis, calls himself "the last remaining bull on the stock." He argues that Michael Foods is misunderstood: "This is a growth company in the packaged food industry -- a rare breed, like finding a white rhino." Earnings aren't keeping pace, he says, because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought-related costs in its potato business. 

Mr. Carver, however, believes the company's egg product won't help the bottom line in the short run, even though it "makes sense -- it's more convenient" and justifies its price, which is higher than shell eggs, because of health and sanitation concerns. 

Prospective competition is one problem.
Last week a closely held New Jersey concern, Papetti High-Grade Egg Products Co., rolled out an aseptically packaged liquefied item called Table Ready.
Company President Steve Papetti says Marriott will be among his clients as well. 

Michael shares closed at 13 3/4 yesterday in national over-the-counter trading.
Says New York-based short seller Mark Cohodes, "In my mind this is a $7 stock." Michael late yesterday announced a $3.8 million stock buy-back program. 

Michael, which also processes potatoes, still relies on spuds for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pretax profit.
But dry growing conditions in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what Michael contracted to pay last spring.
Company lawyers recently sent letters to growers saying that Michael "would take very seriously any effort . . . to divert its contracted-for potatoes to other outlets." Still, analysts believe that profit margins in the potato business will be down again this year. 

Nixdorf Computer AG, citing continued profitability problems, said it will have to reduce personnel further, notably in research and development sectors. 

The troubled West German computer company said, in a statement to its employees, that the number of persons working in product development will be reduced world-wide to 2,440 from 2,888 by the end of 1990.
The number of workers in production sectors will be cut by 488, to 5,200 by September.
The cuts will be made half within Germany and half abroad. 

In the first nine months of 1989, Nixdorf said, sales rose 5% amid good growth in selected areas such as banks and trading companies. 

The company also cited some success in damping cost increases and said it wants to return to profitability in 1990.
It cited the expected beneficial effects of a concentration on key products, further structural changes within the group and cooperation agreements with other companies.

So-called cross-border acquisitions totaled $23.1 billion in the second quarter, down from $33.6 billion a year earlier, according to the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. 

In a cross-border transaction, the buyer is in a different region of the globe from the target.
Such transactions numbered 670 in the second quarter, up from 527 a year earlier.
However, the total value declined for deals of $100 million and up. 

The downturn in total value may be only temporary, suggested Herb Adler, a KPMG Peat Marwick partner.
He explained, in part, that restructuring to prepare for the Common Market expansion due in 1992 "has become more of a strategic priority, both for companies inside and outside the European Community." 

In the second quarter, middle-market cross-border transactions -- deals under $100 million each -- numbered 619 and totaled $6 billion, compared with 478 such transactions totaling $4.9 billion a year earlier, the firm said. 

Large cross-border deals numbered 51 and totaled $17.1 billion in the second quarter, the firm added.
That compared with 49 such transactions totaling $28.7 billion as year earlier. 

James River Corp., Richmond, Va., said it acquired the tissue operations of Buhrmann-Tetterode N.V. of the Netherlands for about $77 million. 

The Dutch unit, known as Celtona B.V., is a leading maker of consumer and away-from-home tissue products for the Benelux region.
In addition, the acquisition includes production assets of Invercon Papermils, a maker of household tissue products for the U.K. and Ireland.
The combined operations had 1988 revenue of about $100 million. 

James River, a maker of pulp, paper and plastic products, already has interests in tissue businesses in France, Spain, Italy and Turkey.
The company said it plans to form European ventures with Italian and Finnish companies.
The Celtona operations would become part of those ventures. 

Eastern Airlines' creditors committee backed off a move to come up with its own alternative proposals to the carrier's bankruptcy reorganization plans, according to sources familiar with the committee. 

In a meeting in New York yesterday, the committee put on hold instructions it gave two weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for Eastern's future, the sources said.
The consultants had been working to finish a report this week. 

That means Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp. of Houston, can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today, when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee.
The committee intends to meet next week to make a recommendation on the new plan. 

In another development yesterday, creditors were told that $40 million they had expected to become available for implementing a reorganization may not materialize, according to one source. 

Texas Air has run into difficulty reselling about $20 million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market, the person said.
And plans to raise another $20 million through changes to an insurance policy have hit a snag, the source said.
An Eastern spokesman said "the $40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of Eastern's plan.
Forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant." 

It is unclear what caused the creditors to do an about-face on exploring alternatives to Eastern's new reorganization plan.
However, since Eastern first filed for Chapter 11 protection March 9, it has consistently promised to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar.
Because the carrier is still pledging to do that, some committee members successfully argued that there's little reason yet to explore a different plan, according to one person familiar with the creditors' position.
Earlier this month the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman, Sachs & Co., the experts hired by the creditors, contended that Eastern would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting.
Ernst & Young said Eastern's plan would miss projections by $100 million.
Goldman said Eastern would miss the same mark by at least $120 million. 

The consultants maintained Eastern wouldn't generate the cash it needs and would have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan.
Eastern at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts' report "completely off base." 

Yesterday, Joel Zweibel, an attorney for Eastern's creditors committee, declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to.
He said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on Eastern's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating. "In every case, people would like to see a consentual plan," he said. 

Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off $1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size.
Eastern eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk, its South American routes, which were valued at $400 million.
Such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid, and the two sides had to begin negotiating again. 

Eastern has publicly stated it is exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and has predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings early next year, operating more flights than it originally had scheduled. 

Wall Street continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer-driven program trading. 

Kidder, Peabody & Co., a unit of General Electric Co., announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account, and Merrill Lynch & Co. pulled out of the practice altogether. 

At the New York Stock Exchange, which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange's own listed companies, Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the Big Board's 49 stock specialist firms.
The specialists, a trader said, were "livid" about Mr. Phelan's recent remarks that sophisticated computer-driven trading strategies are "here to stay." Many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market, including the 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 13.
A specialist is an exchange member designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock. 

Mr. Phelan's meeting with the floor brokers comes as he prepares to explain the exchange's position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow, according to exchange officials. 

A Big Board spokesman would only say, "We're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue." The program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant Contel Corp. said it and 20 or more of the Big Board's listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange's role in program trading. 

The decision by Merrill, the nation's largest securities firm, represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading.
Merrill has been the fourth-biggest stock-index arbitrage trader on the Big Board this year, executing an average of 18.1 million shares a month in such trades, or about one million shares a day. 

Merrill's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading pullbacks of recent days, because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock-index arbitrage trades for customers.
Most Wall Street firms, in pulling back, have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts. 

Merrill has been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers.
Merrill also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading, including tough margin -- or down-payment -- requirements and limits on price moves for program-driven financial futures. 

Merrill, in a statement by Chairman William A. Schreyer and President Daniel P. Tully, said index arbitrage "has been clearly identified in the investing public's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility," so Merrill won't execute such trades until "effective controls" are in place. 

In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options.
The idea is to lock in profits from short-term swings in volatile markets. 

Last Thursday, PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether, but the firm wasn't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is.
Other large firms, including Bear, Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co., last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage, but only for the firms' own accounts. 

Kidder made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday, after a special meeting between the firm's president and chief executive officer, Michael Carpenter, and its senior managers.
Just a week ago, Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder, the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year.
Index arbitrage, Mr. Carpenter said last week, doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole" and Kidder's customers were "sophisticated" enough to know that. 

But yesterday, Mr. Carpenter said big institutional investors, which he wouldn't identify, "told us they wouldn't do business with firms" that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts. "We were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions," he said. 

Kidder so far this year has executed a monthly average of 37.8 million shares in index-arbitrage trading, and is second only to Morgan Stanley in overall program trading, which includes index arbitrage.
Most of Kidder's program trading is for its own account, according to the New York Stock Exchange. 

Kidder denied that GE's chairman and chief executive, John F. Welch, had anything to do with Kidder's decision.
But at least one chief executive said he called Mr. Welch to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading, and other market sources said they understood that Mr. Welch received many phone calls complaining about Kidder's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business.
Kidder has generally been sensitive to suggestions that GE makes decisions for its Kidder unit. "Our decision had nothing to do with any pressure Mr. Welch received," Mr. Carpenter said. "This was a Kidder Peabody stand-alone decision." 

A spokeswoman for GE in Fairfield, Conn., said, "Absolutely no one spoke to Jack Welch on this subject" and added, "Anyone who claims they talked to Jack Welch isn't telling the truth." 

Supporters of index arbitrage haven't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy, as some did during the post-crash outcry of 1987.
But Merrill Lynch, in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage, suggested that the current debate has missed the mark. 

Merrill said it continues to believe that "the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy.
Indeed, there are legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that involve program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries." 

Merrill's index arbitragers will continue to do other kinds of computer-assisted program trading, so there probably won't be any layoffs at the firm, people familiar with Merrill's program operation said. 

Meanwhile, Bear Stearns Chairman and Chief Executive Alan C. Greenberg said his firm will continue stock-index arbitrage for its clients.
At the firm's annual meeting last night, he told shareholders that index arbitrage won't go away, despite the public outcry. "If they think they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few Wall Street firms to quit, they are crazy," Mr. Greenberg said. "It's not going to stop it at all." 

Mr. Greenberg, noting that stock-index arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock market's volatility, said that for the first four months of the firm's fiscal year beginning in July, stock-index arbitrage had been a "break-even" proposition for Bear Stearns. 

In response to a shareholder's suggestion, Mr. Greenberg agreed that European firms will simply pick up the index-arbitrage business left behind by U.S. institutions. 

Pressure from big institutional investors has been the major catalyst for Wall Street's program-trading pullback.
And there was speculation yesterday that Fidelity Investments and other large mutual-fund companies might soon follow the lead of Kemper Corp. and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading.
A Fidelity spokesman in Boston denied the speculation, saying the program-trading issue was more of a regulatory problem. 

But a much smaller mutual fund company, the USAA Investment Management Co. unit of USAA, San Antonio, Texas, said it informed nine national brokerage firms it will cease business with them unless they stop index-arbitrage trading.
USAA, with 400,000 mutual fund accounts, manages more than $10 billion, $2 billion of which is in the stock market.
Michael J.C. Roth, USAA executive vice president, called program trading "mindless." He said there is "no valid investment reason" for stock-index futures to exist. 

A program-bashing move is clearly on.
Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of Contel, who is helping organize the alliance of Big Board-listed firms, said he had no time to work yesterday because he received so many phone calls, faxes and letters supporting his view that the Big Board has been turned into a "gambling casino" by program traders. 

"We are reaching the moment of truth" on Wall Street, said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. "{Wall Street} is beginning to realize -- as Shakespeare said -- the trouble is not in our stars, but in ourselves."

Dataproducts Inc. said it filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to block a tender offer by DPC Acquisition Partners, alleging that the hostile offer violates a standstill agreement between the two concerns. 

DPC, an investor group led by New York-based Crescott Investment Associates, had itself filed a suit in state court in Los Angeles seeking to nullify the agreement.
Earlier this year, Dataproducts had rejected a $15 a share offer from DPC, saying it wasn't adequately financed.
DPC last week launched a new, $10-a-share offer for the Woodland Hills, Calif.-based computer printer maker. 

DPC said it couldn't comment on the suit. 

USG Corp. agreed to sell its headquarters building here to Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. of Toronto, and will lease the 19-story facility until it moves to a new quarters in 1992. 

The building-materials concern didn't disclose terms of the sale, which will close in the first quarter of next year. 

Proceeds from the planned sale of the 250,000-square-foot building "will help reduce the debt incurred as a result of our July 1988 recapitalization," said a USG official. 

Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling about 3,600 of its 1990-model Escorts because the windshield adhesive was improperly applied to some cars. 

Separately, Ford and Mazda Motor Corp. 's U.S. sales arm said they are recalling about 88,500 1988-model Mercury Tracers and 220,000 1986, 1987 and 1988 model Mazda 323s equipped with 1.6-liter fuel-injected engines to replace the oil filler cap.
Mazda makes the Tracer for Ford. 

As a result of the adhesive problem on the Ford Escort subcompacts, windshields may easily separate from the car during frontal impact, the U.S. auto maker said.
When properly applied, the adhesive is designed to retain the windshield in place in a crash test at 30 miles per hour. 

A Ford spokesman said the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker isn't aware of any injuries caused by the windshield problem.
Ford said owners should return the cars to dealers so the windshields can be removed and securely reinstalled. 

Mazda and Ford said a combination of limited crankcase ventilation and improper maintenance could cause engine oil in some of the Mercury Tracers and Mazda 323s to deteriorate more rapidly than normal, causing increased engine noise or reduced engine life.
They said the problems aren't safety related. 

Both companies will replace the oil filler cap with a ventilated oil filler cap.
Both also will inspect and replace, if necessary, oil filters and oil strainers, at no charge to owners. 

For owners who have followed the recommended oil maintenance schedule, Mazda will extend to five years or 60,000 miles the warranty term for engine damage due to abnormal engine oil deterioration.
The normal term for the 1986 and 1987 model 323 is two years or 24,000 miles; the term for the 1988 323 is three years or 50,000 miles.
Ford said the term on its warranty is already six years or 60,000 miles. 

Separately, Ford said it will offer $750 cash rebates to buyers of its 1990-model Ford Bronco sport utility vehicle.
It said it will also offer buyers the option of financing as low as 6.9% on 24-month loans.
Ford also offered the low financing rate option on 1989-model Broncos, which previously carried a $750 cash discount.
Ford said the new offer will begin Saturday and run indefinitely. 

If Japanese companies are so efficient, why does Kawasaki-Rikuso Transportation Co. sometimes need a week just to tell its clients how soon it can ship goods from here to Osaka?
Why, until last spring, did the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan sometimes take several days to correct typographical errors in its paper work for international transactions? 

Because the companies have lacked office computers considered standard equipment in the U.S. and Western Europe, Japanese corporations' reputation as hi-tech powerhouses is only half right.
Their factories may look like sets for a Spielberg movie, but their offices, with rows of clerks hunched over ledgers and abacuses, are more like scenes from a Dickens novel. 

Now, the personal-computer revolution is finally reaching Japan.
Kawasaki-Rikuso, a freight company, set up its own software subsidiary this year and is spending nearly a year's profit to more than double the computer terminals at its main office.
In April, the Long-Term Credit Bank linked its computers in Tokyo with its three American offices. 

Overall, PC sales in Japan in the first half of 1989 were 34% higher than in the year-earlier period.
Combined PC and work-station use in Japan will jump as much as 25% annually over the next five years, according to some analysts, compared with about 10% in the U.S.
And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency, more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice. "We have too many people in our home offices," says Yoshio Hatakeyama, the president of the Japan Management Association. "Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low." 

With Japanese companies in a wide range of industries -- from heavy industry to securities firms -- increasing their market share world-wide, the prospect of an even more efficient Japanese economic army may rattle foreigners.
But it also offers opportunities; Americans are well poised to supply the weapons.
Japan may be a tough market for outsiders to penetrate, and the U.S. is hopelessly behind Japan in certain technologies.
But for now, at least, Americans are far better at making PCs and the software that runs them. 

After years of talking about selling in Japan, more and more U.S. companies are seriously pouring in.
Apple Computer Inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year.
Lotus Development Corp. has slashed the lag between U.S. and Japan product introductions to six months from three years.
Ungermann-Bass Inc. has a bigger share of the computer-network market in Japan than at home. 

But the Japanese have to go a long way to catch up.
Typical is one office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau -- the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry. "Personal Computer" yearbooks are lined up on nearly every desk, and dog-eared copies of Nikkei Computer crowd magazine racks.
But amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one real-life PC. 

While American PC sales have averaged roughly 25% annual growth since 1984 and West European sales a whopping 40%, Japanese sales were flat for most of that time.
Japanese office workers use PCs at half the rate of their European counterparts and one-third that of the Americans. 

Moreover, Japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than American offices do.
In the U.S., PCs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network.
In Japan, many desktop terminals are limited to one function and can't communicate with other machines. 

The market planning and sales promotion office of Nomura Securities Co., for example, has more than 30 computers for its 60 workers, a respectable ratio.
But the machines aren't on employees' desks; they ring the perimeter of the large office.
Some machines make charts for presentations.
Others analyze the data.
To transfer information from one to the other, employees make printouts and enter the data manually.
To transmit charts to branch offices, they use a fax machine.
Meanwhile, a woman sitting next to a new Fujitsu terminal writes stock-market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand calculator.
In an efficient setup, the same PC could perform all those tasks. 

In the U.S., more than half the PC software sold is either for spreadsheets or for database analysis, according to Lotus.
In Japan, those functions account for only about a third of the software market.
Machines dedicated solely to word processing, which have all but disappeared in the U.S., are still more common in Japan than PCs.
In the U.S., one-fifth of the office PCs are hooked up to some sort of network.
In Japan, about 1% are linked. 

"Computers here are used for data gathering," says Roger J. Boisvert, who manages the integrated-technologies group in McKinsey & Co. 's Tokyo office.
Some Japanese operations, such as securities-trading rooms, may be ahead of their American counterparts, he says, but "basically, there's little analysis done on computers in Japan." Of course, simply buying computers doesn't always solve problems, and many American companies have erred by purchasing technology they didn't understand.
But healthy skepticism is only a small reason for Japan's PC lag.
Various cultural and economic forces have suppressed demand. 

Because the Japanese "alphabet" is so huge, Japan has no history of typewriter use, and so "keyboard allergy," especially among older workers, remains a common affliction. "I have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery," says Matsuo Toshimitsu, a 66-year-old executive vice president of Japan Air Lines, explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his office this summer. 

While most American employees have their own private space, Japanese "salarymen" usually share large, common tables and rely heavily on old-fashioned personal contact.
Top Japanese executives often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy presentations.
And Japan's management system makes it hard to impose a single, integrated computer system corporatewide. 

Besides, a computer processing the Japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability, while the screen and printer need far better definition to depict accurately the intricate symbols.
Until recently, much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least unaffordable. 

Some analysts estimate the average PC costs about 50% more in Japan than the U.S.
But the complex language isn't the only reason.
For the past decade, NEC Corp. has owned more than half the Japanese PC market and ruled it with near-monopoly power.
With little competition, the computer industry here is inefficient. 

The U.S. market, too, is dominated by a giant, International Business Machines Corp.
But early on, IBM offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it.
Dozens of small companies did, swiftly establishing a standard operating system.
That spurs competition and growth, allows users to change and mix brands easily, and increases software firms' incentive to write packages because they can be sold to users of virtually any computer. 

If a record industry lacked a common standard, Sony CD owners could listen to a Sony version of Madonna's "Like a Prayer" but not one made for a Panasonic player.
That is the state of Japan's computer industry.
NEC won't release its code, and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own proprietary operating system -- all incompatible with each other.
IBM established its standard to try to stop falling behind upstart Apple Computer, but NEC was ahead from the start and didn't need to invite in competitive allies. 

Meanwhile, the big players haven't tried to copy the NEC standard.
Corporate pride as well as the close ties common among Japanese manufacturers help explain why.
Most rivals "have a working relationship with NEC, often through cross-licensing of technology," the Japan Personal Computer Software Association noted recently. "They hesitate to market NEC-compatible machines; NEC disapproves of such machines, and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship." 

The result, according to many analysts, is higher prices and less innovation.
While tens of thousands of software packages using the IBM standard are available in the U.S., they say only about 8,000 are written for NEC.
A year ago, Japan's Fair Trade Commission warned NEC about possible violations of anti-monopoly laws for discouraging retailers from discounting. 

In Japan, "software is four to five years behind the U.S. because hardware is four to five years behind, because NEC is enjoying a monopoly," complains Kazuhiko Nishi, the president of Ascii Corp., one of Japan's leading PC-magazine publishing and software companies. "There are no price wars, no competition." An NEC spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in Japan because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the U.S.
She adds that some technological advances trail those in the U.S. because the Japanese still import basic operating systems from American companies. 

But the market is changing.
The government is funding several projects to push PC use.
Over the next three years, public schools will get 1.5 million PCs, a 15-fold increase from current levels. 

In the private sector, practically every major company is setting explicit goals to increase employees' exposure to computers.
Toyota Motor Corp. 's sales offices in Japan have one-tenth the computers per employee that its own U.S. offices do; over the next five years, it is aiming for rough parity.
Within a year, Kao Corp., a major cosmetics company, plans to eliminate 1,000 clerical jobs by putting on a central computer network some work, such as credit reports, currently performed in 22 separate offices. 

By increasing the number of PCs it uses from 66 to 1,000, Omron Tateishi Electronics Co., of Kyoto, hopes not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way the company is run. "Managers have long been those who supervise their subordinates so orders would be properly acted on," a spokesman says. "But new managers will have to be creators and innovators . . . and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached easily, and also shared." 

Meanwhile, more computer makers now are competing for the new business.
Seiko Epson Corp., a newcomer to the industry, fought off a legal challenge and started selling NEC clones last year.
It has won about 15% of the retail PC market.
Sony Corp., which temporarily dropped out of the PC business three years ago, started selling its work station in 1987 and quickly became the leading Japanese company in that market. 

In a country where elbow room is scarce, laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry's future growth.
Toshiba Corp. busted open that sector this summer with a notebook-sized machine that retails for less than 200,000 yen (under $1,500) -- one of the smallest, cheapest PCs available in the country.
Fujitsu Ltd. is lavishing the most expensive promotion campaign in its history -- including a 100,000-guest bash at Tokyo Dome -- for its sophisticated sound/graphics FM Towns machine, which it advertises for everything from balancing the family checkbook to practicing karaoke, bar singing. 

Many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard.
Two years ago, most of the smaller makers joined under the Microsoft Corp. umbrella to adopt a version of the American IBM AT standard.
That hasn't generated much sales, but this summer Microsoft rallied all the major NEC competitors to make their new machines compatible with the IBM OS/2 standard. 

A healthy, coherent Japanese market could also make it far easier for Japanese companies to sell overseas, where their share is still minimal.
But it could also help American companies, which also are starting to try to open the market.
As with many other goods, the American share of Japan's PC market is far below that in the rest of the world.
U.S. makers have under 10% share, compared with half the market in Europe and 80% at home. 

Though no formal trade barriers exist, the Japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter. "If it were an open market, we would have been in in 1983 or 1984," says Eckhard Pfeiffer, who heads Compaq Computer Corp. 's European and international operations.
His company, without any major effort, sells more machines in China than in Japan.
Although it has opened a New Zealand subsidiary, it is still only "studying" Japan, the only nation that hasn't adopted IBM-oriented specifications.
And because general retail centers such as ComputerLand have little presence in Japan, sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers. 

But the Americans are also to blame.
They long made little effort here.
IBM, though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business, didn't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did, and that wasn't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard.
Apple didn't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the Chinese characters of written Japanese -- until three years after entering the market.
Critics also say American companies charge too much.
Japan's FTC says it is investigating Apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting. 

But the U.S. companies are redoubling their efforts.
Apple recently hired its first Japanese president, luring away an official of Toshiba's European operations, as well as a whole Japanese top-management team.
Earlier this year, it introduced a much more powerful kanji operating system and a kanji laser printer.
IBM just last year started selling its first machine that could run in both Japanese and English and that substantially enhances compatibility with its American products. 

"It may take five years to break even in Japan," says John A. Siniscal, who runs the Asia-Pacific office for McCormack & Dodge, a U.S. software company. "But it's an enormous business opportunity." 

BROKERAGE HIRING languishes amid market turmoil.
But survivors earn more. 

Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. counts under 39,000 workers, down 100 from the start of the year and off 8,500 from after its merger and the market collapse two years ago.
Another major firm has cut 6,000 workers, 13% of its staff, since Black Monday.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics says securities firms in New York City alone have slashed 17,000 jobs from the December 1987 peak of 163,000.
Average annual earnings of those who have hung on, though, surged to $78,625 last year from $69,553 in 1987. 

Any hiring is confined to retail sales.
Illinois Company Investments had been trimming its ranks until last summer.
But then it was acquired by Household International Inc. Now it offers richer commissions to lure a broker a week.
Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. this year adds 70 people -- 60 of them in retail -- to its 1,300-member staff.
A.G. Edwards & Sons runs training classes and looks for experienced brokers. 

"We're always going to hire someone we consider to be a winner," an Edwards official says. 

SKILLED WORKERS aplenty are available to cope with earthquake damage. 

"I don't foresee any shortages over the next few months," says Ken Allen, an official of Operating Engineers Local 3 in San Francisco.
Ironically, "up until the quake, we desperately tried to fill jobs," especially for crane and bulldozer operators.
But the Oct. 17 temblor put a halt to much nonessential building, and heavy rains last week slowed the rest, freeing construction workers for earthquake repairs. 

The supply of experienced civil engineers, though, is tighter.
In recent months, California's Transportation Department has been recruiting in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Texas for engineers experienced in road and bridge design.
But, with the state offering only $39,000 a year and California's high standard of living, "there aren't too many to choose from," says Brent Scott, a recruiting officer.
He says the department now has 75 openings and wants to hire 625 civil engineers over the next 15 months. 

THE IRS may taketh what the Labor Department giveth.
But stay tuned. 

Employee-benefit specialists drew a collective sigh of relief in early October when the Labor Department backed away from a proposal that companies let former employees and beneficiaries -- along with active workers -- borrow against balances in 401(k) and similar savings plans.
In an advisory letter, the department said that, starting Oct. 18, loans could be limited to "parties in interest," which generally means active workers but also includes retirees who continue as directors and 10% shareholders. 

Now comes word that IRS regulations being drafted could put companies in violation of the tax code if they make loans to retiree shareholders and directors but don't make them available to other former workers who usually earned less.
The IRS says the question won't be settled until the regulations are issued "shortly." But violation could bring substantial tax penalties to both employer and employees. "It's a severe case of regulatory whiplash," complains Henry Saveth of consultant A. Foster Higgins & Co. 

Frederick Rumack of Buck Consultants has asked Labor to recraft its rule to remove the IRS threat. 

CORPORATE DOWNSIZING digs deeper.
Outplacement consultant Right Associates says the average pay of its clients fell to $66,743 last year from $70,765 in 1987; severance pay dropped to 25 weeks from 29.
Both reflect the dismissal of lower-level and shorter-tenure executives. 

FIRST TEACH THYSELF. Executives universally believe workers should know their employer-sponsored benefits.
But three out of four managers can't accurately state the value of their own packages, consultant Noble Lowndes says. 

MEA CULPA. Fully 62% of the doctors surveyed for Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. think their fellow physicians are responsible for rising health-care costs, ahead of hospitals (55%) and patients (48%). 

NO, YOU WORK! Only one in four companies with flexible benefit plans lets workers buy or sell vacation days, consultant Towers Perrin says.
Employees like the option but firms say it's too tough to run.
STUDENTS SHUN burger flipping for jobs tied to careers.
Some even study. 

"Fast-food jobs aren't popular no matter what they pay," says a Tufts official.
Working students, she explains, want "some satisfaction." University of Michigan students look for jobs related to planned careers.
Carnegie Mellon, though, says some students conclude they can help their careers most by hitting the books: "They're opting to build their resumes through good grades and leadership roles in fraternities." 

Slowing economies in some areas limit student choice.
Student job postings at Boston University slip 10% this year following a 10% drop in 1988.
Still, the school says there are an ample number and pay is up to $7.20 an hour from $6.90 last year. 

M.B.A. candidates at the University of Pittsburgh earn up to $15 an hour on marketing or computer projects.

Quotron Systems Inc. plans to cut about 400, or 16%, of its 2,500 employees over the next several months. 

"This action will continue to keep operating expenses in line" with revenue, said J. David Hann, president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Quotron.
The move by the financial information and services subsidiary of Citicorp is a "response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry, which has been contracting" since October 1987's stock market crash, the executive added. 

Quotron, which Citicorp purchased in 1986, provides price quotations for securities, particularly stocks.
Quotron also provides trading and other systems, services for brokerage firms, and communications-network services. 

Independent providers of financial information, including Quotron, have been under some pressure as the major securities houses try to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue.
Shearson, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. and Salomon Inc. are discussing formation of a group to sell securities-price data. 

The job cuts, to be made in a number of areas at various job levels, are "a streamlining of operations," a spokeswoman said.
The company has no immediate plans to close any operations, she said, but Quotron may subcontract some work that it has been doing in-house, including refurbishment and production of Quotron 1000 equipment used in delivering financial data. 

The spokeswoman said the move isn't directly a response to Quotron's loss of its two biggest customers, Merrill Lynch & Co. and American Express Co. 's Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., to Automated Data Processing Inc. earlier this year. 

The spokeswoman noted that last week, Kidder, Peabody & Co., the securities subsidiary of General Electric Co., chose a Quotron subsidiary to provide order-processing services.
And Oct. 24, Quotron said it will market the automated trading system of broker-dealer Chapdelaine Government Securities Inc. 

Quotron isn't profitable on Citicorp's books because of the interest charges the New York bank holding company incurred in buying the financial-data concern for $680 million, says Ronald I. Mandle, analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
But Citicorp "does view Quotron) as being crucial to the financial-services business in the 1990s," the analyst added. 

This past summer, Quotron sold its customer-service unit, employing 600, to Phoenix Technologies Inc., a closely held computer-service firm in Valley Forge, Pa.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Penn Central Corp., Cincinnati, said it agreed in principle to acquire Noranda Inc. 's Carol Cable Co. unit for $177 million. 

The company said Carol Cable, based in Pawtucket, R.I., is a leading supplier of electrical and electronic wire and cable for the distributor, retail and original equipment manufacturer markets. 

Carol Cable, which operates 12 manufacturing plants, had operating profit of $11.7 million on sales of $153.3 million for the first six months of this year and operating profit of $25.6 million on sales of $294.6 million for all of 1988. 

The maker of telecommunications and defense equipment said Carol Cable's portfolio and market focus would complement the company's current wire and cable businesses.
The plan is subject to a satisfactory due diligence investigation of Carol Cable by Penn Central, a definitive agreement and regulatory approvals. 

The following were among yesterday's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets, with terms and syndicate manager, as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report:

Fluor Corp. said it was awarded a $300 million contract to provide engineering and construction-management services at a copper mine in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, for a unit of Freeport-McMoRan Copper Co. 

Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif., will direct expansion of the mine's capacity to 52,000 metric tons a day from 32,000 metric tons a day.
Completion of the project is expected by mid-1992. 

In 1988, Fluor had revenue of $5.1 billion and earnings of $56.4 million, or 71 cents a share. 

Cray Research Inc. won government clearance for its proposed reorganization of founder Seymour Cray's supercomputer design team into a separate company. 

Internal Revenue Service approval of the move as a tax-free transaction was the last hurdle to splitting up the world's dominant maker of supercomputers, which Mr. Cray founded in 1974. 

Cray's directors set Nov. 15 as the record date for distribution of shares in the new company, to be called Cray Computer Corp.
It will trade over the counter under the symbol CRAY. 

The plan calls for Cray Research holders to receive one share in the new company for every two shares held.
An estimated 14.7 million Cray Computer shares will be distributed, Cray Research said. 

Under the accord, Cray Research will transfer to Mr. Cray's fledgling operation $53.3 million of assets primarily related to the Cray-3 development project his team is undertaking and will lend Cray Computer $98.6 million. 

Cray Research will retain a 10% interest in the new company, which will be based in Colorado Springs, Colo. 

When it announced the planned breakup in May, Cray Research said development costs of several competing projects were squeezing its earnings growth.
After the split, the two companies presumably will be rivals for orders from government and commercial customers. 

The Federal Reserve Board said it is delaying approval of First Union Corp. 's proposed $849 million acquisition of Florida National Banks of Florida Inc., pending the outcome of an examination into First Union's lending practices in low-income neighborhoods. 

The decision reflects the Fed's tougher stance on enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act, a federal law passed in 1977 to help low-income residents obtain loans.
In recent years, unions and community groups have won big commitments from banks to make low-interest loans in certain neighborhoods by threatening to hold up proposed acquisitions with protests to the Fed about reinvestment act compliance.
Few petitions, however, have actually delayed or scuttled mergers. 

The current dispute involves allegations that Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union hasn't lived up to its responsibilities under the reinvestment act. 

During the summer, Legal Services Corp., a Florida legal aid group, filed a petition with the Fed on behalf of residents in four Florida counties.
The petition challenged First Union's lending record in the state, saying that the bank-holding company had "shut itself off from contact with the low-income community and is redlining almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the state." 

In deferring action on the merger, the Fed said, "The Board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow {it} to reach a final conclusion on First Union's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in Florida and North Carolina, including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those communities." 

The Fed said the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to begin a Community Reinvestment Act examination of First Union's Florida and North Carolina banking units in the next two weeks. 

First Union, with assets of about $32 billion, said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory authorities.
The bank added that it believes the review will "demonstrate that First Union is in compliance with the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act." The company has already missed its initial Oct. 1 target date for completing the merger.
It said yesterday it still expects to close the acquisition later this year or early in 1990. 

Florida National, if acquired, would almost double First Union's banking franchise in Florida to $17 billion in assets.
That would make it the second-largest bank, after Barnett Banks Inc., in a state widely considered to be the most lucrative banking market in the country. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, First Union shares rose 25 cents to $23.
Florida National stock closed unchanged at $25.875 in national over-the-counter trading. 

Earlier this year, the Fed denied an application by Continental Bank Corp. to purchase Grand Canyon State Bank in Scottsdale, Ariz., on grounds that Continental hadn't fully complied with the Community Reinvestment Act. 

At the time, the Fed said the denial, the first ever on such grounds, signaled the agency's new emphasis on the Community Reinvestment Act. 

General Motors Corp. is planning to build a new engine plant in Europe that may be built in Britain, provided the company can reach a satisfactory agreement with unions, sources said. 

Officials of Vauxhall Motors Ltd., GM's British unit, were meeting with union leaders late yesterday in hopes of winning such an accord. 

The engine plant may encompass plans for a joint components venture with Jaguar.
Alternatively, a separate engine plant may be built as part of GM's planned tie-up with the British luxury car maker, the sources said. 

Sources said a "complex and detailed" announcement of a joint agreement between General Motors and Jaguar would be made by Jaguar "some time in the next 2 1/2 weeks." 

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued New York state for age discrimination against appointed state judges.
The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges that New York's mandatory retirement age of 76 violates federal law. 

Separately, the commission intervened in a Connecticut state judge's age-bias suit in federal court in New Haven.
The commission's filing in that case challenges Connecticut's mandatory retirement age of 70 for appointed judges. 

The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin, whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end, and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination.
The suit, assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood, seeks a permanent injunction, back pay for judges who have been forced to retire, reinstatement of retired judges and "other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of (New York's) unlawful employment practices." 

Justice Rubin, a state judge since 1969, said the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench. 

"The issue isn't age -- age is just a number.
The issue is one of a judge's experience, his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench," Justice Rubin said. "I've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities." Because Justice Rubin turned 76 on May 9, he isn't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year. 

The suit's impact on New York may be narrow, however.
Most New York judges are elected, and the federal age-discrimination law doesn't apply to elected officials, said James L. Lee, regional attorney for the EEOC in New York.
Under New York law, elected judges must retire at age 70, but then can be appointed to two-year terms until they reach 76. 

A spokeswoman for the state's Office of Court Administration declined to comment on the suit.
But she said the state currently has 35 appointed judges who are over 70. 

In Connecticut, however, most state judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state legislature.
The parties in the Connecticut case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another EEOC age-bias case against Vermont.
In the Vermont case, a federal judge ruled that the state's mandatory age of 70 for appointed judges was illegal; Vermont's appeal of that decision is pending before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. 

Aaron Ment, Connecticut's chief court administrator, declined to comment on the suit and the EEOC's intervention.
He said the state has 165 appointed judges and 15 "trial referees," who are former judges over age 70 and serve a restricted role on the bench. 

ORGANIZED CRIME Strike Forces likely to be abolished next month. 

U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's plan to dissolve the 14 regional organized-crime strike forces is expected to go into effect next month, despite the opposition of Democratic congressional leaders and lawyers in the special units. 

The units are autonomous from U.S. attorneys' offices and focus exclusively on prosecuting organized-crime cases.
In February, Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan to abolish the units.
He says the strike-force lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of U.S. attorneys. 

Mr. Thornburgh will be free to disband the strike forces after Congress approves a $479 million appropriation for federal law-enforcement and drug-interdiction agencies, according to David Runkel, a Justice Department spokesman.
The bill is expected to pass in Congress next month. 

Congress temporarily halted Mr. Thornburgh's effort with an appropriation resolution that prohibited him from using budgeted funds to implement his plan. 

Opponents say Mr. Thornburgh's plan will needlessly break up longtime, tightly knit crime-fighting units that have successfully prosecuted major organized-crime figures.
They predict that organized-crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to U.S. attorneys' offices. 

Some former strike-force personnel say the units have already begun to break up.
The Eastern District unit in Brooklyn, N.Y., lost seven of its 15 attorneys this year partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization, says Laura A. Brevetti, who left the strike force to join Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein, a New York law firm. 

"Those who have left have expressed an opinion that the strike force should continue," Ms. Brevetti says. 

But Mr. Runkel contends there has been no exodus of strike-force lawyers.
He says 27 lawyers have left and 21 have been hired since Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan.
At the time the plan was announced, there were 135 lawyers. 

Some congressional leaders intend to continue to fight for independent strike forces.
A spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D., Mass.) says Mr. Thornburgh would be required to reinstate the units next year if an proposed omnibus crime bill is passed.
Among other things, the bill calls for a reorganization of the Justice Department.
The Senate is expected to consider the bill shortly, says the senator's spokesman. 

Mr. Runkel says he doubts Mr. Kennedy can muster enough congressional support to reorganize the Justice Department. 

"We will vigorously oppose the bill," he says. "I don't think (the reorganization is) going to happen." 

WHITMAN & RANSOM recruits lawyers from disbanding firm: The 204-lawyer New York firm will bring in at least 12 partners and a not yet determined number of associates from Golenbock & Barell, which will dissolve Dec. 31.
Golenbock, with 35 lawyers, has lost several partners during the past year.
Some Golenbock lawyers won't be invited to join Whitman & Ransom, according to partners at both firms.
Whitman & Ransom managing partner Maged F. Riad said the Golenbock recruits will enhance the firm's corporate and litigation departments. 

SHORT SKIRTS not welcome in Texas court: Shelly Hancock, a male county court judge in Houston, refused to let a woman plead guilty to a drunk-driving charge because her skirt stopped three inches above her knees.
The woman appeared in court Thursday to enter her plea, but when she started to approach the bench, she was stopped by Judge Hancock.
He told the woman's lawyer, Victor Blaine, that the short skirt was inappropriate for a court appearance.
Despite Mr. Blaine's protests, the judge rescheduled her case for Nov. 27.
Kelly Siegler, an assistant district attorney who was in the courtroom, disputed suggestions the action was sexist, saying she had seen Judge Hancock turn away male defendants dressed in shorts, tank tops or muscle shirts "many times." Judge Hancock didn't return phone calls. 

Revco D.S. Inc., the drugstore chain that filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year, received a $925 million offer from a group led by Texas billionaire Robert Bass. 

Revco reacted cautiously, saying the plan would add $260 million of new debt to the highly leveraged company.
It was Revco's huge debt from its $1.3 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 that forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 

Revco insists that the proposal is simply an "expression of interest," because under Chapter 11 Revco has "exclusivity rights" until Feb. 28.
Those rights prevent anyone other than Revco from proposing a reorganization plan. 

Also under Chapter 11, a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders, banks and other creditors.
A financial adviser for Revco bondholders, David Schulte, of Chilmark Partners, had mixed reactions to the offer. 

He said he feared a Revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a "cheap deal," and that the Bass group's offer would give them more money.
However, the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only -- $260.5 million -- and no equity.
The Revco bonds are high-yield, high-risk "junk" bonds; holders have $750 million in claims against Revco, Mr. Schulte said. 

Revco received the offer Oct. 20, but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders.
Acadia Partners Limited Partnership, a Fort Worth, Texas, partnership that includes the Robert M. Bass Group, made the proposal.
Mr. Bass is based in Fort Worth. 

Analysts said the nation's second-largest drugstore chain was a valuable company, despite its financial woes.
Its problem, they say, is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $515 million debt load is keeping Revco in the red. 

"If bought at the right price, it could still be profitable," said Jeffrey Stein, an analyst at McDonald & Co., Cleveland. 

In addition, Revco's 1,900 stores in 27 states represent a lot of real estate, he said, and demographics are helping pharmacies: The nation's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs. 

Last week, Revco's parent company, Anac Holding Corp., said the company reported a loss of $16.2 million for the fiscal first quarter, compared with a loss of $27.9 million in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales were $597.8 million, up 2.4% from the previous year. 

The company, based in Twinsburg, Ohio, said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased 51%, to $9.2 million from $6.1 million. 

Acadia Partners and the Bass Group declined to comment.
The partnership also includes American Express Co., Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 

The offer consists of $410.5 million in cash and the rest in notes.
Acadia would sell up to 10% of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution, but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares. 

Revco's chairman and chief executive officer, Boake A. Sells, said both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans, but little progress has been made since negotiations began this summer. 

He said he has not met with representatives from Acadia.
Any reorganization proposal, Mr. Sells said, is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company, bondholders, banks and other creditors.
Revco has $1.5 billion in claims outstanding. 

"It's not like the board can decide" by itself, Mr. Sells said, adding, "we're indifferent to (the Bass) plan.
We just want a plan that satisfies creditors and at the end leaves a healthy Revco." 

But Mr. Schulte, the bondholders' adviser, said Revco was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal. "They want to pretend it doesn't exist," he said. 

Mr. Schulte, who met with Acadia representatives on Oct. 10, said, "It's certainly a responsible offer.
It's not an effort to steal the company" in the middle of the night. 

Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered ratings on long-term debt of CS First Boston Inc., the holding company of Wall Street giant First Boston Corp., because of First Boston's "aggressive merchant banking risk" in highly leveraged takeovers. 

In downgrading CS First Boston's subordinated domestic, Euromarket and Swiss debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2, Moody's is matching a move made by the other major credit rating concern, Standard & Poor's Corp., several months ago.
Moody's also confirmed the Prime-1 rating, its highest, on CS First Boston's commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs. 

In addition, Moody's said it downgraded Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston's senior and subordinated Swiss debt to single-A-2 from single-A-1 and lowered Financiere CSFB N.V.'s junior subordinated perpetual Eurodebt, guaranteed by Financiere Credit Suisse -- First Boston, to single-A-3 from single-A-2.
About $550 million of long-term debt is affected, according to Moody's. 

A spokesman for CS First Boston said: "We remain committed to a full range of businesses, including merchant banking.
We think that the ratings revision is unfortunate but not unexpected.
Our commitment to manage these businesses profitably will continue." 

First Boston's merchant banking risks mounted last month as highly leveraged Campeau Corp., First Boston's most lucrative client of the decade, was hit by a cash squeeze and the high-risk junk bond market tumbled.
First Boston incurred millions of dollars of losses on Campeau securities it owned as well as on special securities it couldn't sell.
First Boston financings for several other highly leveraged clients, including Ohio Mattress, unraveled as the high-risk junk bond market plummeted. 

Moody's said its rating changes actions "reflect CS First Boston's aggressive merchant banking risk as well as the risk profile of its current merchant banking exposures." It said CS First Boston "has consistently been one of the most aggressive firms in merchant banking" and that "a very significant portion" of the firm's profit in recent years has come from merchant banking-related business. 

"Moody's believes that the uncertain environment for merchant banking could put pressure on CS First Boston's performance," the rating concern said, citing "continued problems" from the firm's exposures to "various Campeau-related firms" and to Ohio Mattress. 

"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston's equity," Moody's said. "Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm's equity."

G.D. Searle & Co. said the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of Kerlone, a hypertension drug developed by a joint venture between Searle and a French concern. 

Searle, a unit of Monsanto Co., said the "beta-blocker" high-blood-pressure drug Kerlone is the first product to reach the market through Lorex Pharmaceuticals, the U.S. company jointly owned by Searle and Synthelabo, a French pharmaceutical concern owned by France's L'Oreal S.A. 

Pacific Telesis Group said its Pacific Bell unit sustained property damage of about $45 million to $50 million from the California earthquake earlier this month. 

The San Francisco-based telecommunications company said it carries $150 million of earthquake insurance with a $10 million deductible provision. 

Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer, told securities analysts in New York that the company expects somewhat slower per-share earnings growth in 1990, although annual growth should return to the traditional figure of about 7% thereafter. 

As factors contributing to the temporary slowdown, he cited one-time rate reductions prescribed by California regulators as a prelude to a new framework that removes profit constraints.
He also mentioned increased capital investment by Pacific Bell for network improvements. 

Mr. Ginn said the company's cellular operations now serve about 341,000 customers, up 46% from a year ago. 

The dollar finished mostly stronger yesterday, boosted by a modest recovery in share prices. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 6.76 points in a spate of bargain-hunting following last week's declines. 

"Attention is fixed on the stock market for lack of anything else to sink our teeth into," said Robert White, a vice president at First Interstate of California. 

Some analysts predict that in the absence of market-moving news to push the U.S. unit sharply higher or lower, the currency is likely to drift below 1.80 marks this week. 

But others reject the view, and forecast the dollar will continue to hold its current tight trading pattern.
They argue that weakness in both the yen and sterling have helped offset bearish U.S. economic news and have lent support to the dollar. 

In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8340 marks, up from 1.8300 marks late Friday, and at 141.90 yen, up from 141.65 yen late Friday.
Sterling was quoted at $1.5820, up from $1.5795 late Friday. 

The dollar rose against the Swiss and French francs. 

In Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.32 yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 142.17 yen. 

Last week, the surprise resignation of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson sent the British pound into a tailspin. 

While sterling bounced back from session lows in a bout of short-covering yesterday, foreign exchange dealers said that any hopes that the pound would soon post significant gains have evaporated. 

Traders said that statements made over the weekend to quell concern about the stability of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government and the future of her economic program largely failed to reassure investors and bolster the flagging British unit. 

In her first televised interview following Mr. Lawson's resignation, Mrs. Thatcher reiterated her desire to keep sterling strong and warned again that full entry into the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism would provide no easy solution to Britain's economic troubles. 

She said that the timing of the United Kingdom's entry would depend on the speed with which other members liberalize their economies. 

Mrs. Thatcher's remarks were seen as a rebuff to several leading members of her own Conservative Party who have called for a more clear-cut British commitment to the EMS. 

At the same time, a recent poll shows that Mrs. Thatcher has hit the lowest popularity rating of any British leader since polling began 50 years ago. 

Comments by John Major, who has succeeded Mr. Lawson, also failed to damp market concern, despite his pledge to maintain relatively high British interest rates. 

According to one London-based analyst, even higher interest rates won't help the pound if Britain's government continues to appear unstable. 

One U.S. trader, however, dismissed sterling doomsayers while acknowledging there is little immediate upside potential for the U.K. unit. 

"There is no question that the situation is bad, but we may be painting a gloomier picture than we should," he said. 

He predicts the pound will continue to trade in a very volatile fashion, with "fits of being oversold and overbought" before recovering its losses. 

Dealers also note that the general lack of enthusiasm for the yen has helped bolster the U.S. dollar. 

They observe that persistent Japanese investor demand for dollars for both portfolio and direct investment has kept a base of support for the dollar at around 140 yen. 

The dollar began yesterday on a firm note in Tokyo, closing higher in late trade.
In Europe, the dollar closed slightly up in a market dominated by cross trades.

The Supreme Court let stand a New York court's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown. 

The high court's action, refusing to hear appeals by several drug companies, is likely to have a significant impact at several levels.
The most immediate effect is in New York, where former manufacturers of the anti-miscarriage drug DES -- the synthetic female hormone diethylstilbestrol -- face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the 700 to 1,000 DES lawsuits pending in that state.
The lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug. 

On a broader scale, the ruling could encourage other states' courts to adopt the logic of the New York court, not only in DES cases but in other product-related lawsuits, as well. 

The New York Court of Appeals ruling parallels a 1980 decision by the California Supreme Court requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it can't be determined which company is at fault.
Paul Rheingold, a New York lawyer who represents DES victims, said that before the New York ruling, only the states of Washington and Wisconsin had followed the California decision.
Now that the New York decision has been left intact, other states may follow suit. 

"Generally, when New York and California go one way, it has a tremendous influence on other states, especially small ones," said Mr. Rheingold.
The high court refused to hear appeals by Rexall Drug Co., which went out of business in 1987 and was taken over by RXDC Liquidating Trust; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc., a unit of Squibb Corp.; and Eli Lilly & Co. 

The appeals involved DES, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use from the 1940s until 1971 to prevent miscarriages during pregnancy.
In 1971, the FDA banned the use of DES after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug. 

Lawsuits over the harm caused by DES have flooded federal and state courts in the past decade.
In many cases, the lawsuit was filed long after the drug was used -- the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected for years -- and there is no way to prove which of several companies manufactured the doses consumed by certain women. 

Under traditional legal theories, inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed.
But in its ruling last April, the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose can't be determined.
Each company's share of liability would be based on their share of the national DES market. 

The New York court also upheld a state law, passed in 1986, extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing DES lawsuits.
The effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension. (Rexall Drug Co. vs.

Government Contractors 

The high court, leaving intact a $4.25 million damage award against General Dynamics Corp., declined to resolve questions about a legal defense against civil lawsuits often used by government contractors. 

Last year, the Supreme Court defined when companies, such as military contractors, may defend themselves against lawsuits for deaths or injuries by asserting that they were simply following specifications of a federal government contract.
In that decision, the high court said a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract, that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment. 

But last February, a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a damage award against General Dynamics, rejecting the company's use of the government contractor defense.
The appeals court said the defense is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber stamp a company's design or plans and engaged in a "substantive review and evaluation" on a par with a policy decision. 

General Dynamics appealed to the high court, backed by numerous business trade groups, arguing that the appeals court definition restricts the defense too severely. 

General Dynamics was sued by the families of five Navy divers who were killed in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber.
The accident was caused by faulty operation of a valve.
A federal district court awarded damages to the families and the appeals court affirmed the award. (General Dynamics Corp. vs.

On June 30, a major part of our trade deficit went poof! No figure juggling; no witchcraft; just vastly improved recording of some of our exports. 

The result?
The Commerce Department found that U.S. exports in 1988, net of imports, were understated by $20.9 billion a year and understated at the annualized rate of $25.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989.
More than half of the "newly found" net exports were from just a few service-sector categories.
Some of the biggest service-industry exporters -- American financial-service companies, for example -- have yet to be fully included in our export statistics. 

Nearly 10 years ago, representatives of service-sector companies worked out a plan with the Commerce Department to improve the data on service-sector exports.
Both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports -- such as inbound tourism; legal, accounting and other professional services furnished to foreigners; financial, engineering and construction services; and the like -- were not being counted as exports. 

The monthly "trade deficit" figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade: manufactured goods and raw materials.
In the quarterly balance-of-payments report, those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services, as well as returns on investments abroad by Americans and returns on foreign investments in the U.S. 

Over time, through benchmark surveys, the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered.
The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. (net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad), some exports by professional firms (a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine), and improved data from travel and tourism. 

In just these three areas, the Commerce Department found $23 billion more exports than previously reported and $11.6 billion more imports, with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $11.3 billion, to $19 billion. 

Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas, the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $20 billion a year.
That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $75 billion than to $95 billion in 1988, and $55 billion (annualized) rather than $80 billion in the first quarter of 1989. 

These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar.
The materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market. 

What does this mean for trade policy?
Too early to tell, but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture.
It does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both goods and services, but it does suggest that it is our exports of services, and not just borrowing, that is financing our imports of goods.

Western Union Corp. took steps to withdraw its proposed debt swap for $500 million in high-interest notes and said it is looking at other alternatives for refinancing the debt. 

Western Union had said two weeks ago that it might withdraw the pending offer, which would have replaced $500 million in so-called reset notes, now paying 19.25% annual interest and set to come due in 1992, with two new issues paying lower interest. 

Yesterday the company said it had filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission to withdraw the registration statement regarding the proposed swap.
A Western Union spokesman, citing adverse developments in the market for high-yield "junk" bonds, declined to say what alternatives are under consideration. 

But some holders of the Western Union notes expect the company to propose a more-attractive debt swap that will give them a substantial equity stake in the company.
Western Union has had major losses in recent years as its telex business has faltered in the face of competition from facsimile machines and as other business ventures have gone awry. 

The major question, said one holder who asked not to be named, is whether New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, whose Brooke Partners controls Western Union, is willing to offer a large enough equity stake to entice bondholders into agreeing to a new swap. 

The $500 million in notes, the largest chunk of Western Union's $640 million in long-term debt, stems from the company's major restructuring in December 1987.
The notes became burdensome when reset provisions allowed their interest rate to be raised to 19.25% last June. 

Western Union had offered to swap each $1,000 face amount of the notes for six shares of common stock and two new debt issues: a $500 note paying an interest rate starting at 16.75% annually and rising in later years, due in 1992, and a $500 note, due in 1997, paying a fixed rate of 17% and including rights protecting a holder against a decline in the trading price of the bond. 

Western Union must make $48 million in interest payments on the reset notes on Dec. 15, and a company spokesman said it fully intends to meet the payments.
But Western Union has said it must lower the interest rate on its debt to regain full financial health. 

Pierre Peladeau, a Canadian newspaper publisher little-known in the U.S., figures to become a big player in North American printing -- and his ambitions don't end there. 

Yesterday, Quebecor Inc., a Montreal printing, publishing and forest-products company 53%-owned by Mr. Peladeau, agreed to acquire Maxwell Communication Corp. 's U.S. printing subsidiary, Maxwell Graphics Inc., for $500 million in cash and securities.
The purchase, expected to be completed by year end, will make Quebecor the second-largest commercial printer in North America, behind only R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., Chicago. 

The printing customers that Quebecor will gain through Maxwell Graphics include the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade, Time, Sports Illustrated and TV Guide. 

But the transaction is just Mr. Peladeau's latest step in a larger design: to build Quebecor through acquisitions into an integrated paper, publishing and printing concern with a reach throughout North America.
He already has achieved vertical integration on a limited scale: Quebecor can put a weekly newspaper on almost any Quebec doorstep without using outside help, from chopping down the tree to making the newsprint to flinging it up onto the porch. 

Analysts say Quebecor's purchase is part of a trend toward consolidation in the North American printing industry.
Along with Donnelley, says Jacques Massicotte, an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc. in Montreal, "Quebecor has positioned itself as one of the two key players." He adds: "I think this is a great strategic move for Quebecor.
They are buying an operation that is running well." 

Mr. Peladeau says he isn't trying to catch up to Donnelley, which has annual sales of over $3 billion. "Size doesn't matter," Mr. Peladeau says. "What counts is the bottom line." 

Some of Mr. Peladeau's ventures, including an earlier push into the U.S. market, haven't paid off on the bottom line.
Quebecor started the Philadelphia Journal, a daily tabloid, in 1977 and closed it three years later.
The venture cost Quebecor $12 million, Mr. Peladeau says. 

More recently, some former Quebecor executives started their own printing company, specializing in printing and distributing advertising circulars.
Quebecor still lags in the Quebec circulars market, while Mr. Peladeau's former employees are expanding across Canada. 

Mr. Peladeau took his first big gamble 25 years ago, when he took advantage of a strike at La Presse, then Montreal's dominant French-language newspaper, to launch the Journal de Montreal.
The tabloid's circulation soared to 80,000, but plunged to under 10,000 when the La Presse strike ended. 

Still, Mr. Peladeau stuck with the venture.
Now the Journal, flush with ads and hugely profitable, is even with La Presse in weekend circulation and outsells it 3 to 2 every weekday. 

Mr. Peladeau has never made any apologies for publishing the tabloid, a brash mix of crime and sports. "I've read Balzac," he answers critics. "It's tabloid news from A to Z." 

Quebecor also publishes a second tabloid in Montreal, the struggling 18-month-old Montreal Daily News; dailies in Quebec City and Winnipeg, Manitoba; and dozens of weeklies covering most of Quebec.
A series of recent acquisitions made it the dominant magazine publisher in Quebec.
After a recent merger, it is also the only province-wide distributor of magazines and newspapers in Quebec.
Finally, with Maxwell Communication, the company controls 54% of Donohue Inc., a Quebec City pulp and paper concern. 

In yesterday's accord, Quebecor agreed to pay $400 million in cash for Maxwell Graphics, and to give Maxwell Communication a 20% stake, valued at $100 million, in Quebecor's new printing subsidiary.
The new, as yet unnamed, subsidiary will combine Quebecor's existing printing unit and Maxwell Graphics.
It will have 61 plants from coast to coast and $1.5 billion in annual sales. 

Quebecor will own 57.5% of the new subsidiary.
Caisse de Depot et Placement, the Quebec government pension-fund agency, will pay $112.5 million for the remaining 22.5% stake in the printing operation. 

Pierre-Karl Peladeau, the founder's son and the executive in charge of the acquisition, says Quebecor hasn't decided how it will finance its share of the purchase, but he says it most likely will use debt. 

The Maxwell deal is Quebecor's second big printing acquisition in just over a year.
Last October, Quebecor bought 23 Canadian printing plants from BCE Inc., a Montreal telecommunications, manufacturing, energy and real estate company.
That purchase doubled Quebecor's annual printing revenue to $750 million. 

Maxwell's sale of its U.S. printing unit was expected, the last major business to be disposed of in a major reshuffling of assets.
According to its most recent annual report, covering the 15 months ended March 31, Maxwell Communication bought $3.85 billion in assets -- including Macmillan Inc. and Official Airlines Guides -- and sold $2 billion in non-strategic businesses.
Now, Maxwell founder Robert Maxwell says he has an appetite for new acquisitions in the U.S., adding that he could spend "a good deal more" than $1 billion on another U.S. purchase. 

In London trading yesterday, Maxwell Communication shares rose nine pence, to 216 pence ($3.41). 

In Montreal, Quebecor's multiple voting Class A stock closed at C$16.375 (US$13.94), down 12.5 Canadian cents.
Quebecor Class B stock closed at C$15.375, up 62.5 Canadian cents.

Two gunmen entered a Maryland restaurant, ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads.
The killers fled with less than $100. 

Describing this and other grisly killings, Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.) recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty. "The ultimate punishment," he declared, "will protect the law-abiding from the vicious, cruel individuals who commit these crimes." 

There's just one problem: The law that Sen. Thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings.
Most murders are state crimes, so any federal capital-punishment law probably would turn out to be more symbolism than substance. 

Yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking.
Senate Republicans, after repeatedly failing to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation, have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee.
The Democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year -- a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing.
Even some Democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the Senate that favors some kind of broad capital-punishment measure. 

The pending bill, introduced by Mr. Thurmond, would revive the long-dormant federal death-penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the Supreme Court.
In 1972, the high court swept aside all capital-punishment laws -- federal and state alike -- as unconstitutional.
But in 1976, the court permitted resurrection of such laws, if they meet certain procedural requirements.
For instance, juries would have to consider specific "aggravating" and "mitigating" factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death.
Since that 1976 ruling, 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty.
But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level, with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides. 

The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes, most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated.
Among these crimes are murder on federal land, presidential assassination and espionage.
The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death, including murder for hire. (Separately, the Senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists who kill Americans abroad.) 

Amid the swirl of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue, one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty, on top of existing state laws, would deter any would-be criminals. 

For one thing, it's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences, let alone be executed.
Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a Supreme Court justice, for instance, or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death. 

In fact, only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years, according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee's Democratic staff.
The last federal execution before the Supreme Court's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963, meaning that the federal government didn't exercise its execution authority for eight years. 

"In that sense, the whole debate is sort of a fraud," argues a Democratic Senate staff member. "It's distracting attention from serious issues, like how to make DEA, FBI and Customs work together" on drug enforcement. 

Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the Thurmond bill, but they contend that isn't the point. "Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes," says Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).
Executions, regardless of how frequently they occur, are also "proper retribution" for heinous crimes, Mr. Hatch argues.
Thomas Boyd, a senior Justice Department official, says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last November may result in a jump in capital sentences, though that hasn't happened so far. 

In addition to resuscitating the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals, this bill has made race a major part of the death-penalty debate.
Before the bill left committee, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner. 

The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond, who complained that it would "kill" capital punishment.
A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion.
And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings, in two important ways.
It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past.
And it would shift the burden to prosecutors to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities. 

"That burden is very difficult, if not impossible, to meet," says Mr. Boyd. "How do you prove a negative?" Since most prosecutors wouldn't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations didn't affect sentencing, executions everywhere might come to a halt, Mr. Boyd explains. 

At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks, and against black defendants compared with white defendants.
Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research, regardless of its accuracy, isn't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence. 

The Kennedy amendment would, in effect, legislate around the Supreme Court ruling.
Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals, says Richard Burr, director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's capital-punishment defense team. 

Mr. Kennedy failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year's anti-drug legislation, and it will be severely attacked on the Senate floor this time around.
But if it survives, it could prompt other statutory changes, according to the Mr. Burr.
It might force Congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance -- murders by repeat offenders who torture their victims, perhaps. 

Narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever deterrent effect it now has.
And that, in turn, would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances. 

Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said the nation's No. 3 auto maker will need to close one or two of its assembly plants because of the slowdown hitting the industry. 

In an interview with the trade journal Automotive News, Mr. Iacocca declined to say which plants will close or when Chrysler will make the moves.
But he said, "we have too many plants in our system.
So the older or most inefficient capacity has got to go." 

According to industry analysts, Chrysler plants most likely to close are the St. Louis No. 1 facility, which builds Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models; the Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant, which dates back to the early 1900s; and two Canadian plants that build the Jeep Wrangler and Chrysler's full-sized vans. 

Chrysler has had to temporarily close the St. Louis and Toledo plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there. 

At Chrysler's 1990 model preview last month, Chrysler Motors President Robert A. Lutz said the No. 3 auto maker, along with other U.S. manufacturers, might be forced to "realign . . . capacity" if market demand doesn't improve.
But Mr. Iacocca's remarks are the most specific indication to date of how many plants could be in jeopardy. 

General Motors Corp. has signaled that as many as five of its U.S. and Canadian plants may not survive the mid-1990s as it struggles to trim its excess vehicle-production capacity. 

The overcapacity problem has intensified in recent years, with foreign auto makers beginning car and truck production in the U.S.
With companies such as Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. running so-called transplant auto operations, Japanese auto production in the U.S. will reach one million vehicles this year. 

"Unless the market goes to 19 million units -- which we all know it's not going to do -- we have the inescapable fact that the transplants are adding capacity," Mr. Lutz said last month.
The Japanese-managed plants eventually will have the capacity to build some 2.5 million vehicles in the U.S. and that will translate into "market share that is going to have to come out of somebody," he added. 

Already Chrysler has closed the Kenosha, Wis., plant it acquired when it bought American Motors Corp. in 1987.
Chrysler has also launched a $1 billion cost-cutting program that will cut about 2,300 white-collar workers from the payroll in the next few months. 

Mercury Savings & Loan Association, Huntington Beach, Calif., reported a third-quarter loss of $3.9 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with net income of $1.4 million, or 22 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. 

Mercury attributed the loss to rapid prepayments of loans and costs incurred in refinancing many house loans this past spring and summer, when interest rates dipped. 

The thrift hired an investment banker earlier this month to advise it regarding a possible sale or merger.
Mercury also is shrinking itself, part of its plan to change its emphasis from buying mortgage loans from mortgage brokers to making loans directly.
Such a focus is "more profitable, more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control," said William A. Shane, Mercury's senior executive vice president.
As of Sept. 30, Mercury's assets were $2.25 billion, down from $2.62 billion a year ago. 

For the nine months, Mercury posted a loss of $5.4 million, or 86 cents share, against net income of $4 million, or 63 cents share, a year earlier. 

Mercury shares closed yesterday at $4.625, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

The French Economics Ministry approved a planned asset swap between the defense and electronics group Thomson-CSF S.A. and the bank group Credit Lyonnais. 

The ministry said the swap, details of which were disclosed last Thursday, will allow both state-controlled companies to reinforce operations in their main markets and argued that the move shows the dynamism of France's state-sector concerns. 

The approval also ends any hope that Banque Nationale de Paris, another state-sector bank, might have had about taking Credit Lyonnais's place in the accord.
It hinted over the weekend that it would have been interested in a hook-up with Thomson-CSF. 

Under details of the accord, Credit Lyonnais will take slightly more than 50% of Thomson-CSF Finance in exchange for about 14% of its own shares.
The move will help the bank to keep up with international solvency ratios being phased in by the Bank for International Settlements and will also represent the first time that its voting shares have been held by a party other than the government. 

NRM Energy Co. said it filed materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission calling for it to restructure into a corporation from a limited partnership. 

The partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding. 

NRM suspended its common distribution in June 1988 and the distribution on its $2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in September.
However, unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $23 million a year, hurting NRM's financial flexibility and its ability to raise capital, NRM said. 

In following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year, NRM also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $2 million a year in administrative costs from the change. 

Under the plan, NRM said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in Edisto Resources Corp. for every 14.97 common units owned.
Holders of NRM's $2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units will receive one new common share in Edisto for every 1.342 units they own. 

After the transaction, current common unitholders will own about 21.3% of Edisto, current acquisition preferred holders will own 72.3%, and current stockholders of Edisto will own about 6.4%, about the same stake as Edisto owns now in NRM. Edisto currently is the general partner of NRM. 

As the largest holder of acquisition preferred units, Mesa Limited Partnership would own about 28% of Edisto after the transaction.
As part of the transaction, Edisto agreed to give Mesa, an Amarillo, Texas, oil and gas partnership managed by T. Boone Pickens Jr., a seat on its board. 

NRM said its $2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred units will be converted into an equal number of shares of $2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred stock of Edisto. 

The transaction is subject to approval of NRM unitholders of record on Oct. 23, among other conditions.
NRM said it expects unitholders to vote on the restructuring at a meeting Dec. 15. 

Secretary of State Baker, we read, decided to kill a speech that Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and a career Soviet expert, was going to give to a student colloquium, the National Collegiate Security Conference.
We keep wondering what Mr. Gates wanted to say. 

Perhaps he might have cited Mr. Gorbachev's need for "a stable currency, free and competitive markets, private property and real prices" and other pie-in-the-sky reforms.
Perhaps he'd have called for "a decentralized political and economic system" without a dominant communist party.
Or political arrangements "to alleviate the grievances and demands of Soviet ethnic minorities and republics." Why, a Bob Gates might even have said, "Nor are Soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant Western credits." 

If Mr. Gates had been allowed to say these things, we would now be hearing about "discord" and "disarray" on foreign policy.
Dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope Mr. Gorbachev would fail, just as they were when Vice President Quayle voiced similar sentiments.
It's somehow OK for Secretary Baker himself, however, to say all the same things.
In fact, he did; the quotes above are from Mr. Baker's speech of two weeks ago. 

So far as we can see, there is no disagreement among Mr. Baker, Mr. Quayle, the Mr. Gates we've read, or for that matter President Bush.
They all understand point one: Nothing the U.S. can do will make much difference in whether Mr. Gorbachev succeeds with perestroika.
Perhaps Mr. Gates would emphasize more than Mr. Baker the many hurdles the Soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed.
But everyone agrees that Mr. Gorbachev's problems result from the failure of his own system.
They can be relieved only by changing that system, not by pouring Western money into it.
GATT membership will not matter to Donbas coal miners short of soap, nor will a START treaty make any difference to Ukrainian nationalists. 

On the other hand, so long as Mr. Gorbachev is easing his grip on his empire, everyone we've heard agrees that the U.S. can benefit by engaging him.
If a deal can be made to cut the world's Ortegas loose from Moscow, why not?
We don't expect much good from nuclear-arms control, but conventional-arms talks might demilitarize Eastern Europe. 

There's nothing in the least contradictory in all this, and it would be nice to think that Washington could tolerate a reasonably sophisticated, complex view.
Yet much of the political culture seems intent on castigating the Bush administration for not "helping" Mr. Gorbachev.
So every time a Bush official raises a doubt about Mr. Gorbachev, the Washington community shouts "Cold War" and "timidity," and an administration spokesman is quickly trotted out to reply, "Mr.
Bush wants perestroika to succeed." 

Mr. Baker seems especially sensitive to the Washington ailment known as Beltway-itis.
Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate, clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism, and fainting spells when someone writes the word "controversy." As one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the Times: "Baker just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be misinterpreted and seized by the press." In short, the problem is not intra-administration disagreement, but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail, and its political opponents will ask "Who lost Gorbachev?" 

Mr. Baker may want to avoid criticism from Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, but as Secretary of State his audience is the entire Free World, not just Congress.
In any case, he's likely to find that the more he muzzles his colleagues, the more leaks will pop up all around Washington, a lesson once learned by Henry Kissinger.
Letting officials express their own nuances can be educational.
We note that in Rome yesterday Defense Secretary Cheney said that European euphoria over Mr. Gorbachev is starting to be tempered by a recognition of "the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with." 

It is in the Western interest to see Mr. Gorbachev succeed.
The odds are against him, as he himself would no doubt tell you.
The ultimate outcome depends on what he does, not on what we do.
Even if the press is ready to seize and misinterpret, these are not very complicated thoughts.
Surely there is someone in the administration, maybe Bob Gates, who could explain them to college students, or even schoolchildren. 

MiniScribe Corp., Longmont, Colo., said it introduced a one-inch high, 80-megabyte hard disk drive that it hopes will prove popular with makers of high-performance laptop and portable computers. 

The troubled disk drive maker aims with the new 3 1/2-inch disks to revive its reputation and sales growth.
MiniScribe said the disk drives have more memory capacity than other disks that size. 

MiniScribe said it expects to begin full volume production of the drives in the U.S. and Singapore in the first quarter next year.
A drive with 120 megabytes of capacity is scheduled for release during the third quarter of 1990. 

MiniScribe has been on the rocks since it disclosed early this year that its earnings reports for 1988 weren't accurate.
After an internal investigation, the company found that senior officials used a variety of schemes to fabricate sales gains, including counting shipments of bricks and defective drives as sales. 

The commercial was absolutely silent.
Breaking into the raucous Chicago Bears-Cleveland Browns match during last week's Monday night football game, it was nothing but simple block letters superimposed on the TV screen. 

"Due to the earthquake in San Francisco, Nissan is donating its commercial air time to broadcast American Red Cross Emergency Relief messages.
Please contribute what you can," the ad said.
The Nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment, and then came a taped plea for donations from former President Reagan -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call.
Within two hours, viewers pledged over $400,000, according to a Red Cross executive. 

Call it disaster marketing.
Nissan Motor is just one of a slew of advertisers that have hitched their ads to the devastating San Francisco quake and Hurricane Hugo.
Sometimes, the ads attempt to raise money; always, they try to boost good will.
By advertising disaster relief, these companies are hoping to don a white hat and come out a hero.
But the strategy can backfire; if the ads appear too self-serving, the companies may end up looking like rank opportunists instead of good Samaritans. 

That hasn't deterred plenty of companies.
Along with Nissan, Grand Metropolitan PLC's Burger King and New York Life Insurance have tied ads to Red Cross donations.
Other ads don't bother with the fundraising; a touching, if self-congratulatory, American Telephone & Telegraph ad that aired Sunday intermixed footage of the devastation in San Francisco and Charleston, S.C., with interviews of people recounting how AT&T helped. 

At Nissan, "we felt we wanted to do something to help them gather money, and we had this airtime on Monday Night Football," explains Brooke Mitzel, a Nissan advertising creative manager. "What did we get out of it?
We got some exposure . . . and pretty much good will." 

The ads are just the latest evidence of how television advertising is getting faster on the draw.
While TV commercials typically take weeks to produce, advertisers in the past couple of years have learned to turn on a dime, to crash out ads in days or even hours.
The big brokerage houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the 1987 crash, when they turned out reassuring ads inviting investors right back into the stock market.
They trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip a few weeks ago.
Nissan created its quake ad in a weekend. 

But as advertisers latch onto disasters with increasing frequency, they risk hurting themselves as much as helping the cause.
They chance alienating the customers they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks. "People see extra messages in advertising, and if a manufacturer is clearly trying to get something out of it . . . if it's too transparent . . . then consumers will see through that," warns John Philip Jones, chairman of the advertising department at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. 

"It can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far, be too pushy," agrees Gary Stibel, a principal with New England Consulting Group, Westport, Conn. "The ultimate form of charity is when you don't tell anyone." Still, he says that only a few of the quake-related campaigns have been "tasteless" and that "the majority have been truly beneficial to the people who need the help.
We don't consider that ambulance chasing." 

The companies running the disaster ads certainly don't see themselves as ambulance chasers, either.
Burger King's chief executive officer, Barry Gibbons, stars in ads saying that the fast-food chain will donate 25 cents to the Red Cross for every purchase of a BK Doubles hamburger.
The campaign, which started last week and runs through Nov. 23, with funds earmarked for both the quake and Hugo, "was Barry's idea," a spokeswoman says. "Barry felt very committed.
He felt we should be giving something back." 

While the campaign was Mr. Gibbons's idea, however, he won't be paying for it: The donations will come out of the chain's national advertising fund, which is financed by the franchisees.
And by basing donations on BK Doubles, a new double-hamburger line the fast-food chain is trying to push, Burger King works a sales pitch into its public-service message. 

Toyota's upscale Lexus division, a sponsor of the World Series, also put in a plug for Red Cross donations in a World Series game it sponsored. "The World Series is brought to you by Lexus, who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake . . . ," the game announcer said.
And New York Life made a plea for Red Cross donations in newspaper ads in the San Francisco area, latching onto the coattails of the Red Cross's impeccable reputation: "The Red Cross has been helping people for 125 years.
New York Life has been doing the same for over 140 years." 

Nancy Craig, advertising manager for the Red Cross, readily admits "they're piggybacking on our reputation." But she has no problem with that, she says: "In the meanwhile, they're helping us." The Red Cross doesn't track contributions raised by the disaster ads, but it has amassed $46.6 million since it first launched its hurricane relief effort Sept. 23.

The collapse of a $6.79 billion labor-management buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. may not stop some of Wall Street's top talent from collecting up to $53.7 million in fees. 

According to one person familiar with the airline, the buy-out group -- led by United's pilots union and UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf -- has begun billing UAL for fees and expenses it owes to investment bankers, law firms and banks. 

The tab even covers $8 million in commitment fees owed to Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., even though their failure to obtain $7.2 billion in bank loans for the buy-out was the main reason for its collapse. 

Under a merger agreement reached Sept. 14, the UAL board agreed to reimburse certain of the buy-out group's expenses out of company funds even if the transaction wasn't completed, provided the group didn't breach the agreement.
The failure to obtain financing doesn't by itself constitute a breach. 

The merger agreement says the buy-out group is entitled to be repaid $26.7 million in fees for its investment bankers, Lazard Freres & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc., and its law firm, Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. 

The buy-out group is also entitled to $16 million to repay a fund created by the pilots union for an employee stock ownership plan.
In addition to the $8 million for Citicorp and Chase, Salomon Brothers is also owed $3 million for promising to make a $200 million bridge loan. 

A spokesman for the buy-out group wasn't immediately available for comment. 

Separately, UAL stock rose $4 a share to $175 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports that Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis has asked United Airlines unions if they're interested in cooperating with Mr. Davis in a new bid for UAL. 

But neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested, and Mr. Davis is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with UAL in September unless UAL accepts an offer below $300 a share. 

Bargain hunters helped stock prices break a weeklong losing streak while bond prices and the dollar inched higher. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 6.76 points to 2603.48 in light trading after losing more than 92 points last week.
Bond prices continued to edge higher in anticipation of more news showing a slower economy.
Although the dollar rose slightly against most major currencies, the focus in currency markets was on the beleaguered British pound, which gained slightly against the dollar. 

Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange dwindled to only 126.6 million shares yesterday as major brokerage firms continued to throw in the towel on program trading.
Kidder Peabody became the most recent firm to swear off stock-index arbitrage trading for its own account, and Merrill Lynch late yesterday took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients. 

Yet that didn't eliminate program trading from the market.
The Dow industrials shot up 23 points in the opening hour, at least in part because of buy programs generated by stock-index arbitrage, a form of program trading involving futures contracts.
But interest waned as the day wore on and investors looked ahead to the release later this week of two important economic reports. 

The first is Wednesday's survey of purchasing managers, considered a good indicator of how the nation's manufacturing sector fared in October.
The other is Friday's measure of October employment, an indicator of the broader economy's health.
Both are expected to show continued sluggishness, which would be good for bonds and bad for stocks. 

In major market activity: 

Stock prices rose in light trading.
But declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered gainers 774 to 684, and broader market indexes were virtually unchanged. 

Bond prices crept higher.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained about an eighth of a point, or about $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
The yield on the issue slipped to 7.92%. 

The dollar gained.
In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.8340 marks and 141.90 yen, compared with 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen Friday.
The British pound, pressured by last week's resignations of key Thatcher administration officials, nevertheless rose Monday to $1.5820 from Friday's $1.5795. 

A group of Michigan investors has offered to buy Knight-Ridder Inc. 's ailing Detroit Free Press for $68 million but has left unclear how the offer will be financed. 

The offer came just prior to arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court over whether the Free Press should be allowed to enter into a joint operating pact with Gannett Co. 's Detroit News. 

The group led by Birmingham, Mich., publicist William D. McMaster didn't name an investment banker backing the deal or say how much its members will contribute to the offer.
Indeed, some individuals identified with the group said they haven't committed any money to the bid and weren't aware of it until they heard about it in local news accounts over the weekend. 

Knight-Ridder wouldn't comment on the offer.
The company has said the paper isn't for sale, and has rebuffed Mr. McMaster's earlier requests for access to Free Press financial statements. 

In his letter to Knight-Ridder President James K. Batten, Mr. McMaster said he arrived at the $68 million figure using Knight-Ridder's corporate financial statements and comments by Knight-Ridder officials that the Free Press has a $50 million value in salvage. 

But in an interview, Mr. McMaster said he and his investment banker would need access to full financial records before firming up the offer. 

EAST GERMANS RALLIED in three cities to demand democratic freedoms. 

As the country's new leader, Egon Krenz, prepared to travel to Moscow today for talks with Soviet leader Gorbachev, hundreds of thousands of East Germans massed in the streets of Leipzig, Halle and Schwerin to call for internal freedoms and the legalization of the New Forum opposition group.
Krenz, however, vowed to preserve the Communist Party's hold on political power and said East Germans shouldn't destabilize the nation with unrealistic demands. 

Communist officials this month have faced nearly daily pro-democracy protests, accompanied by the flight to the West by thousands of East Germans.

It was supposed to be a routine courtesy call. 

A half-dozen Soviet space officials, in Tokyo in July for an exhibit, stopped by to see their counterparts at the National Space Development Agency of Japan.
But after a few pleasantries, the Soviets unexpectedly got serious.
The Soviets have a world-leading space program, the guests noted.
Wouldn't the Japanese like a piece of it?
The visitors then listed technologies up for sale, including launch services and propulsion hardware. 

"We were just surprised," says Tad Inada, NASDA's director for international affairs. "Shocked." 

That Moscow, with its dilapidated economic machine, would try to sell high technology to Japan, one of the world's high-tech leaders, sounds like a coals-to-Newcastle notion.
But "the Soviet Union has areas where it isn't behind Japan," says Mikhail Shapovalov of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. "We have obtained through the development of Cosmos {the Soviet space program} technologies you don't see anywhere else." 

The sales pitch mightn't be as farfetched as it seems.
Japan-U.S. trade relations are bumpy these days, and some Japanese favor decreasing their reliance on U.S. technology in light of the FSX fighter-plane flap, when U.S. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology. 

And, despite its image as a technology superpower, Japan has a lot of weaknesses.
It's a world leader in semiconductors, but behind the U.S. in making the computers that use those chips.
It's a world leader in auto manufacturing, but its aviation industry is struggling, and its space program is years behind the U.S., the Europeans and the Soviets. 

One question being debated in the Soviet Union is how to use the defense sector's research-and-production expertise in the rest of the economy.
Many plants that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce televisions, videocassette recorders, small tractors and food-processing machinery.
The Soviets also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science, which has helped them win twice as many Nobel science prizes as the Japanese. 

Where they lag behind the Japanese is in turning the scientific inventiveness into improved production.
By contrast, the Japanese have proved adept at making use of Soviet inventions.
Kobe Steel Ltd. adopted Soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own system.
Kawasaki Steel Corp. bought a Soviet steel-casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the Soviets.
In 1991, the Soviets will take a Japanese journalist into space, the first Japanese to go into orbit. 

Soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad don't appear to worry the U.S., Japan's principal ally. "We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the Soviet Union," says a State Department official. "Frankly, I wouldn't expect the Japanese to get hooked on anybody's technology, least of all the Soviets." 

Under Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, the Soviets have sought economic ties all over the world, including new export markets.
They believe technology is one of their best bets, and some Soviet officials say Moscow will even consider declassifying military know-how if the price is right.
The Soviets held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in New York and West Germany.
Last week, a Soviet delegation came to Japan to push more space technologies. 

Japan is a major target for the Soviets.
In August, representatives of Keidanren, Japan's largest business organization, visited Moscow to explore exports and investments that would help the Soviet economy.
Out of the blue, the Soviet Chamber of Commerce handed over details on 59 technologies that the Japanese might want to buy.
These mainly involved such areas as materials -- advanced soldering machines, for example -- and medical developments derived from experimentation in space, such as artificial blood vessels. 

A main motive is hard cash.
But, while the Soviets can't expect direct technology flow from Japan, they also hope to benefit from Japanese manufacturing expertise. "The Soviet Union has a lot of know-how, but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy," says Mr. Shapovalov, the Foreign Ministry official.
The Soviets are "contemplating a flexible system under which it would be possible to develop {technology} jointly and even to market it jointly," he says. 

Even if the Japanese find Soviet technology desirable, such discussions would be fraught with political complications.
Still stinging from the international backlash over the sale two years ago of sensitive military technology to the Soviets by a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba Corp., many Japanese are eager to avoid appearing to help the Soviets in any way.
Another hurdle concerns Japan's attempts to persuade the Soviet Union to relinquish its post-World War II control of four islands north of Japan. 

So far, the Soviets have provided only the sketchiest information about their technology and business plans.
And what they have shown isn't impressive. "My impression is that there isn't anything which arouses our interest at first glance," says an official from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.

Vitro S.A. of Monterrey, Mexico, said its THR Corp. subsidiary has entered into definitive loan agreements in connection with Vitro's $21.25-a-share tender offer for Anchor Glass Container Corp. 

The agreements are with Security Pacific National Bank and an affiliate of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. Proceeds of the loan agreement, together with funds from Vitro, will permit the purchase of all shares outstanding of Anchor and the payment of all related costs and expenses. 

Vitro said the definitive agreements require that Anchor obtain a waiver from its bank lenders of existing covenant defaults under its bank facilities.
Since Anchor is still seeking this waiver, Vitro said the tender offer is being extended until 5 p.m. EST tomorrow. 

Nothing was going to hold up the long-delayed settlement of Britton vs.
Thomasini.
Not even an earthquake. 

On the afternoon of Oct. 17, after hours of haggling with five insurance-claims adjusters over settling a toxic-waste suit, four lawyers had an agreement in hand.
But as Judge Thomas M. Jenkins donned his robes so he could give final approval, the major earthquake struck, its epicenter not far from his courtroom in Redwood City, Calif. 

The walls shook; the building rocked.
For a while, it looked like the deal -- not to mention the courtroom itself -- was on the verge of collapse. 

"The judge came out and said, `Quick, let's put this on the record, '" says Sandy Bettencourt, the judge's court reporter. "I said, `NOW?' I was shaking the whole time." 

A 10-gallon water cooler had toppled onto the floor, soaking the red carpeting.
Lights flickered on and off; plaster dropped from the ceiling, the walls still shook and an evacuation alarm blared outside.
The four lawyers climbed out from under a table. 

"Let's close the door," said the judge as he climbed to his bench. 

At stake was an $80,000 settlement involving who should pay what share of cleanup costs at the site of a former gas station, where underground fuel tanks had leaked and contaminated the soil.
And the lawyers were just as eager as the judge to wrap it up. "We were never going to get these insurance companies to agree again," says John V. Trump, a San Francisco defense lawyer in the case. 

Indeed, the insurance adjusters had already bolted out of the courtroom.
The lawyers went to work anyway, duly noting that the proceeding was taking place during a major earthquake.
Ten minutes later, it was done.
For the record, Jeffrey Kaufman, an attorney for Fireman's Fund, said he was "rattled -- both literally and figuratively." 

"My belief is always, if you've got a settlement, you read it into the record." says Judge Jenkins, now known in his courthouse as "Shake 'Em Down Jenkins." 

The insurance adjusters think differently. "I didn't know if it was World War III or what," says Melanie Carvain of Morristown, N.J. "Reading the settlement into the record was the last thing on my mind." 

Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses declined 2.4% to 535,322 units in September from a year earlier, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said. 

The association attributed the drop to a trend among auto makers to move manufacturing operations overseas.
With the exception of August, when exports rose 2.1%, exports have declined every month from year-earlier levels since March. 

The New York Times Co. said it reached a settlement with independent home delivery dealers in the metropolitan New York area that will free the newspaper to expand home delivery circulation. 

The settlement stemmed from a lawsuit the dealers filed in 1982 when the Times began its own competing direct delivery service.
The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $3.6 million over six years, as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years, based on the number of "new customers started by the dealers and on pricing structures," the Times said. 

The amount of the settlement will be taken as a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter.
The settlement, which involves most of the 300 independent newspaper dealers in the New York area, will allow the Times to freely operate its own direct home delivery system. 

Home delivery is the fastest growing segment of the Times's 1.1 million daily circulation.
Currently, about 60% of home delivery subscribers in the New York area receive the paper directly from the Times. 

If there's somethin' strange in your neighborhood . . . 

If there's something' weird and it don't look good. 

Who ya gonna call? 

For starters, some people call Ed and Lorraine Warren. 

When it comes to busting ghosts, the Monroe, Conn., couple are perfect demons.
They claim to have busted spirits, poltergeists and other spooks in hundreds of houses around the country.
They say they now get three or four "legitimate" calls a week from people harried by haunts. "I firmly believe in angels, devils and ghosts," says Mr. Warren, whose business card identifies him as a "demonologist." 

If psychics don't work, but your house still seems haunted, you can call any one of a swelling band of skeptics such as Richard Busch.
A professional magician and musician, he heads the Pittsburgh branch of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal.
Mr. Busch says there is a scientific explanation for all haunts, and he can even tell you how to encourage the spirits. "All you have to do is eat a big pizza, and then go to bed," he says. "You'll have weird dreams, too." 

Either way, the ghostbusting business is going like gangbusters.
Tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the nation's Elm Streets and Amityvilles. "I get calls nearly every day from people who have ghosts in their house," says Raymond Hyman, a skeptical psychology professor at the University of Oregon. 

In a public opinion poll published in the October issue of Parents Magazine, a third of those queried said they believe that ghosts or spirits make themselves known to people. "The movies, the books, the tabloids -- even Nancy Reagan is boosting this stuff," says Paul Kurtz, a philosophy professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who heads the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal.
The committee, formed in 1967, now has 60 chapters around the world. 

The spirits, of course, could hardly care less whether people do or don't believe in them.
They don't even give a nod to human sensibilities by celebrating Halloween.
For the spooks it's just another day of ectoplasmic business as usual, ghostbusters say; the holiday seems to occasion no unusual number of ghost reports. 

One of the busiest ghostbusters is Robert Baker, a 68-year-old semi-retired University of Kentucky psychology professor whose bushy gray eyebrows arch at the mere mention of a ghost.
Mr. Baker says he has personally bested more than 50 haunts, from aliens to poltergeists. 

Mr. Baker heads the Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics.
Like Hollywood's Ghostbusters, Kentucky's stand ready to roll when haunts get out of hand.
But they don't careen around in an old Cadillac, wear funny suits or blast away at slimy spirits.
Mr. Baker drives a 1987 Chevy and usually wears a tweed jacket on his ghostbusting forays. 

"I've never met a ghost that couldn't be explained away by perfectly natural means," he says. 

When a Louisville woman complained that a ghost was haunting her attic, Mr. Baker discovered a rat dragging a trap across the rafters. 

A foul-smelling demon supposedly plagued a house in Mannington, Ky.
Mr. Baker found an opening under the house that led to a fume-filled coal mine.
When the weather cools, Mr. Baker says, hobos often hole up in abandoned houses. "People see activity in there, and the next thing you know, you've got a haunting," he says. 

On a recent afternoon, Mr. Baker and a reporter go ghost-busting, visiting Kathleen Stinnett, a Lexington woman who has phoned the University of Kentucky to report mysterious happenings in her house.
Mrs. Stinnett says she never believed in ghosts before, but lately her vacuum cleaner turned itself on, a telephone flew off its stand, doors slammed inexplicably, and she heard footsteps in her empty kitchen. 

"I was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck running upstairs to see who was there, and it was nobody," she says, eyes wide at the recollection. 

Mr. Baker hears her out, pokes around a bit, asks a few questions and proposes some explanations.
Of the self-starting vacuum cleaner, he says: "Could be Cuddles, {Mrs.
Stinnett's dog}." The flying telephone: "You tangle the base cord around a chair leg, and the receiver does seem to fly off." The ghostly footsteps: "Interstate 64 is a block away, and heavy traffic can sure set a house to vibrating." 

"I'm not sure he's explained everything," Mrs. Stinnett says grudgingly. "There are some things that have gone on here that nobody can explain," she says.
Mr. Baker promises to return if the haunting continues. 

For especially stubborn haunts, Mr. Baker carries a secret weapon, a vial of cornstarch. "I tell people it's the groundup bones of saints," he says. "I sprinkle a little around and tell the demons to leave.
It's reassuring, and it usually works." 

Oregon's Mr. Hyman has investigated claims of flying cats, apparitions and bouncing chandeliers and has come up with a plausible explanation, he says, for every one. "Invariably," he says, "eyewitnesses are untrustworthy." 

Two years ago, a Canadian reader bet Omni Magazine $1,000 that it couldn't debunk the uncanny goings-on in "the Oregon Vortex," a former Indian burial ground in southern Oregon.
To viewers from a distance, visitors to the spot seemed to shrink disproportionately, relative to the background.
The magazine called in Mr. Hyman as a consultant. 

He showed up with a carpenter's level, carefully measured every surface and showed how the apparent shrinkage was caused by the perspective. "A very striking illusion," Mr. Hyman says now, his voice dripping with skepticism, "but an illusion nevertheless." The Canadian wound up writing a check. 

The Rev. Alphonsus Trabold, a theology professor and exorcism expert at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, N.Y., frequently is asked to exorcise unruly spirits, and he often obliges. "On certain occasions a spirit could be earthbound and make itself known," he says. "It happens." 

Father Trabold often uses what he calls "a therapeutic exorcism": a few prayers and an admonition to the spirit to leave. "If the person believes there's an evil spirit, you ask it to be gone," he says. "The suggestion itself may do the healing." 

But sometimes more energetic attacks are required.
To wrestle with a demon in a house owned by a Litchfield, Conn., woman, the Warrens recently called in an exorcist, the Rev. Robert McKenna, a dissident clergyman who hews to the Catholic Church's old Latin liturgy.
I attend, and so does a television crew from New York City. 

Mr. Warren pronounces the Litchfield case "your typical demonic infestation." A Scottish dwarf built the small red house 110 years ago and now his demonic ghost haunts it, Mr. Warren says.
The owner, who begs anonymity, asserts that the dwarf, appearing as a dark shadow, has manhandled her, tossing her around the living room and yanking out a hank of hair.
Two previous exorcisms have failed. 

"This is a very tenacious ghost," Mr. Warren says darkly. 

Father McKenna moves through the house praying in Latin, urging the demon to split.
Suddenly the woman begins swaying and then writhing. "She's being attacked by the demon," Mrs. Warren stagewhispers as the priest sprinkles holy water over the squirming woman, and the television camera grinds.
A half-hour later, the woman is smiling and chatting; the demon seems to have gone.
But Mr. Warren says the woman has "psychic burns" on her back from the confrontation.
She declines to show them. 

"This was an invisible, powerful force that's almost impossible for a layman to contemplate," Mr. Warren says solemnly as the ghostbusting entourage packs up to leave. "This time though," he says, "I think we got it."

Priam Corp. said it filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code and announced a 35% reduction in its world-wide employment. 

The filing in bankruptcy court here follows a string of quarterly losses and product glitches for the maker of harddisk drives for minicomputers and microcomputers. 

Priam had a loss of $25.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 7, compared with year-earlier profit of $543,000, or two cents a share.
Revenue for the year fell 13% to $122.7 million. 

The 200-person staff cutback announced yesterday will bring Priam's employment to about 380 workers, less than half of what it was before a similar, 230-person reduction in August. 

The company yesterday also said it was scrapping one of its major new products, a 760-megabyte drive, which, while technically proficient, didn't hold much promise of generating substantial orders because financing problems caused a nine-month delay in getting the product to market. 

Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its common shares for employee stock plans and other general corporate purposes. 

The forest-products concern currently has about 38 million shares outstanding. 

In yesterday's composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Louisiana-Pacific shares closed at $39.25, down 37.5 cents. 

Investors in the over-the-counter market dumped banking and insurance issues, sending the Nasdaq composite index lower for the third consecutive session. 

All Nasdaq industry indexes finished lower, with financial issues hit the hardest.
Despite some early computer-guided program buying, the Nasdaq composite fell 1.39 to 451.37.
The OTC market now has declined in eight of the past 11 sessions. 

The Nasdaq bank index fell 5.00 to 432.61, while the insurance index fell 3.56 to 528.56, and the "other finance" index dropped 3.27 to 529.32.
The largest financial issues, as measured by the Nasdaq financial index, tumbled 3.23 to 

Meanwhile, the index of the 100 biggest non-financial stocks, the Nasdaq 100, gained 0.47 to 438.15. 

Profit-taking accounted for much of the slide in OTC stock prices, according to David Mills, senior vice president of Boston Company Advisers.
He said many portfolio managers, whose year-end bonuses are tied to annual performance, are selling now rather than risk seeing their gains erode further. 

"The profit locking-in is definitely going on," said Mr. Mills, whose firm manages $600 million for Boston Co. 

Tax-loss sellers, those investors who sell loss-making stocks so they can deduct their losses from this year's income, are also getting out, Mr. Mills said.
That's helping put pressure on both the market's winners and its losers. 

"The stocks that have been the best are having big pullbacks, and the ones that have been the worst are getting clobbered," Mr. Mills said.
He expects the market to sink further and to reach a low sometime next month or in December. 

The selling by money managers and individual investors is turning traders bearish as well. "We are advising a lot of our clients to make moves that make sense to them, rather than waiting until the last minute, because things have been so volatile," said William Sulya, head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
Ralph Costanza, head of the OTC trading department at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, said many market players are awaiting some resolution of the current debate over program trading. 

Much of the market's recent volatility has been blamed on this large-scale computerized trading technique that can send stock prices surging or plummeting in a matter of minutes.
The problem has been particularly damaging to the OTC market, traditionally a base for the small investor. 

Weisfield's surged 14 to 53 after agreeing in principle to be acquired by a unit of Ratners Group for $50 a share.
The stock jumped 9 1/2 Friday, when the company announced it was in takeover talks.
Ratners and Weisfield's said they expect to sign definitive agreements shortly and to complete the transaction by Dec. 15. 

Mid-State Federal Savings Bank advanced 1 1/2 to 20 1/4 after it said it is in talks with a possible acquirer.
The bank said the talks resulted from solicitations by its financial adviser. 

Jaguar assumed its recently customary place on the OTC most active list as its American depository receipts gained 1/4 to 11 7/8 on volume of 1.2 million shares and Daimler-Benz joined the list of companies interested in the British car maker.
Daimler said it has had talks with Jaguar about possible joint ventures. 

Meanwhile, General Motors and Ford Motor continue their pursuit of the company.
Ford has acquired more than 13% of Jaguar's shares, and GM has received U.S. regulatory clearance to buy 15%. 

ShowBiz Pizza Time gained 1 1/2 to 13.
The company reported third-quarter operating profit of 37 cents a share, compared with 12 cents a share a year earlier.
A third-quarter charge of $3.5 million related to planned restaurant closings resulted in a net loss for the quarter. 

Employers Casualty, which reported a $53.9 million third-quarter loss late Friday, fell 2 1/4 to 13 3/4.
The loss was largely due to a $55.2 million addition to reserves.
Employers Casualty had a loss of $3.6 million in the year-earlier quarter. 

Old Stone fell 1 5/8 to 13 1/2.
Late Friday, the company reported a loss of $51.3 million for the third quarter after earning $9.2 million a year before. 

The loss came after a $23.3 million addition to loan-loss reserves.
The bank made a $4.5 million provision in the 1988 quarter.
Old Stone repeated projections that it will be profitable for the fourth quarter and will about break even for the year. 

Abraham Lincoln Federal Savings Bank sank 4 to 13 1/2 after announcing a shakeup that will change senior management and reorganize the bank's mortgage business as a separate unit.
The bank also said it will establish a loan-loss reserve of $2.5 million to $4 million against a construction loan that is in default. 

The bank, which previously said it was for sale, said it has received no offers and that its board will review whether to continue soliciting bids. 

Singer Bette Midler won a $400,000 federal court jury verdict against Young & Rubicam in a case that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using "sound-alike" performers to tout products. 

The decision in Los Angeles federal court stems from a 1985 Mercury Sable TV ad that Young & Rubicam worked up for Ford Motor Co.
The ad agency had approached Ms. Midler about appearing, but she declined, citing a longstanding policy of refusing advertising work.
The agency then turned to a former backup singer for Ms. Midler who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of Ms. Midler's 1973 hit song "Do You Wanna Dance." 

The appeals court held: "When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs." 

The judge in the jury trial said there was insufficient evidence to hold Ford liable in the case.
In a statement, Young & Rubicam called the award "unfortunate but bearable." 

Peter Laird, a Los Angeles lawyer for Ms. Midler, said, "We believe that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies cannot with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers.
That is a property right that belongs to the performer." 

The award, although far less than the $10 million, including punitive damages, that Ms. Midler sought, is likely to force Madison Avenue to further rethink how they use famous songs in ads.
Last year's appeals court decision, for instance, spawned several suits, reportedly including a recent action by the heirs of singer Bobby Darin against McDonald's Corp. over its "Mac Tonight" TV commercials, a rough parody of Mr. Darin's "Mack the Knife" trademark. 

The appeals-court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case in 1970 involving singer Nancy Sinatra and a tire ad -- also a Young & Rubicam product.
Ms. Sinatra sued over the use of her "These Boots are Made for Walkin'" song in the ad. 

At that time, the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law, which has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances. 

"One thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not distinctive but that Bette Midler is.
I am not sure that judges, many of whom I like very much, are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers," said Richard Kurnit, a New York advertising lawyer. 

Nonetheless, Mr. Kurnit said that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect. "It has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form," he said.

An ancient red-figured Greek kylix, or drinking cup, was recovered backstage at Sotheby's this spring and has been returned to the Manhattan couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago.
Robert Guy, an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in "IFAR Reports," knew was stolen.
The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall.
To confirm Mr. Guy's identification, Sotheby's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen, agreed to release it.
The cup had been insured, and in short order it was given over to a Chubb & Son representative.
The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home. 

A former curator of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y., pleaded guilty in July to stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips, among them 29 Dick Tracy strips by Chester Gould, 77 Prince Valiant Sunday cartoons by Hal Foster, and a dozen Walt Disney animation celluloids, according to Barbara Hammond, the museum's director.
He sold them well below market value to raise cash "to pay off mounting credit-card debts," incurred to buy presents for his girlfriend, his attorney, Philip Russell, told IFAR.
The curator, 27-year-old Sherman Krisher of Greenwich, Conn., had worked his way up from janitor in seven years at the museum.
The theft was discovered early this year, soon after Ms. Hammond took her post. 

Sentencing was postponed on Aug. 18, when Mr. Krisher was hospitalized for depression.
His efforts to get back the stolen strips had resulted in recovery of just three.
But on Oct. 6, he had reason to celebrate.
Two days earlier, his attorney met in a Park Avenue law office with a cartoon dealer who expected to sell 44 of the most important stolen strips to Mr. Russell for $62,800.
Instead, New York City police seized the stolen goods, and Mr. Krisher avoided jail.
He was sentenced to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of $45,000. 

Authorities at London's Heathrow Airport are investigating the disappearance of a Paul Gauguin watercolor, "Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo," that has two sketches on its verso (opposite) side.
Valued at $1.3 million, it was part of a four-crate shipment.
The air-waybill number was changed en route, and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced, so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered missing.
Although Heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time, the Gauguin may be "lost." Chief Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the airport said, "It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted." 

Officials at the University of Virginia Art Museum certainly would agree.
Their museum had purchased an Attic black-figured column krater and shipped it from London.
It was reported stolen in transit en route to Washington, D.C., in February.
Months later, the Greek vase arrived in good condition at the museum in Charlottesville, having inexplicably traveled by a circuitous route through Nairobi. 

Two Mexican college dropouts, not professional art thieves, have been arrested for a 1985 Christmas Eve burglary from the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.
About 140 Mayan, Aztec, Mixtec and Zapotec objects, including some of Mexico's best-known archaeological treasures, were taken.
The government offered a reward for the return of the antiquities, but routine police work led to the recovery.
As it turned out, Carlos Perches Trevino and Ramon Sardina Garcia had hidden the haul in a closet in the Perches family's home for a year.
Then they took the art to Acapulco and began to trade some of it for cocaine.
Information from an arrested drug trafficker led to the two men and the recovery of almost all the stolen art. 

Among other happy news bulletins from the German Democratic Republic, the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts announced that it has recovered "Cemetery in the Snow," a painting by the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich.
The artist's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market, and the U.S. State Department notified IFAR of the theft in February 1988.
According to a source at the East Europe desk, two previously convicted felons were charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to prison terms of four and 12 years. 

The precious canvas, cut from its frame at the time of the theft, was found in nearby Jena, hidden in the upholstery of an easy chair in the home of the girlfriend of one of the thieves.
No charges were brought against her. 

Trompe l'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye, but Robert Lawrence Trotter, 35, of Kennett Square, Pa., took his fooling seriously.
He painted one himself in the style of John Haberle and sold it as a 19th-century original to antique dealers in Woodbridge, Conn.
Mr. Trotter's painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle; tucked behind the ribbons were envelopes, folded, faded and crumpled papers and currency.
Mr. Trotter's fake Haberle was offered at a bargain price of $25,000 with a phony story that it belonged to his wife's late aunt in New Canaan, Conn. 

The dealers immediately showed their new acquisition to an expert and came to see it as a fake.
They persuaded Mr. Trotter to take it back and, with the help of the FBI, taped their conversation with him.
After his arrest, the forger admitted to faking and selling other paintings up and down the Eastern seaboard. 

Ms. Lowenthal is executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research (IFAR). 

After a bad start, Treasury bonds were buoyed by a late burst of buying to end modestly higher. 

"The market was pretty dull" for most of the day, said Robert H. Chandross, vice president at Lloyds Bank PLC.
He said some investors were reluctant to plunge into the market ahead of several key economic indicators due this week, especially Friday's potentially market-moving employment report. 

During the first hour of trading yesterday, prices fell as much as 1/4 point, or down about $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
But market activity was energized as investors started to view the lower price levels as attractive.
And the Treasury's $17.6 billion auction of short-term bills, which generated strong buying interest, helped to lift the bond market out of the doldrums. 

"We saw good retail demand by small banks, individuals and institutions and that is one reason why the market advanced" late in the day, said Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at Norwest Corp., Minneapolis.
He said the change in sentiment also reflected perceptions that the slate of economic statistic due this week will be "conducive to a bond market rally." 

The employment report, which will provide the first official measure of the economy's strength in October, is expected to show smaller gains in the generation of new jobs.
Other key economic indicators due this week include today's release of the September leading indicators index and new-home sales.
Tomorrow, the October purchasing managers report is due and on Thursday comes October chain-store sales. 

Despite yesterday's modest bond market gains, economists say investors are anxious about the Treasury's huge quarterly refunding of government debt, the timing of which depends on Congressional efforts to raise the debt ceiling.
Although the Treasury will announce details of the November refunding tomorrow, it could be delayed if Congress and President Bush fail to increase the Treasury's borrowing capacity.
The debt ceiling is scheduled to fall to $2.8 trillion from $2.87 trillion at midnight tonight. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/8 point.
Mortgage-backed securities were up less than 1/8 point and investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged. 

Strong demand for New York City's $813 million general obligation bonds propped up the municipal market.
Traders said most municipal bonds ended 1/2 point higher. 

The New York City issue included $757 million of tax-exempt bonds priced to yield between 6.50% to 7.88%, depending on the maturity.
The $56 million of New York's taxable general obligation bonds were priced to yield between 9.125% to 9.90%. 

As expected, the longer-term tax-exempt New York bonds had yields nearly as high as those on taxable long-term Treasury bonds.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended yesterday at about 7.92%.
Bond dealers said the rates for the long-term tax-exempt New York City bonds were among the highest, as a percentage of Treasury rates, for any New York City issue in recent memory. 

A spokesman for New York City Comptroller Harrison Goldin said the high rates reflect investors concerns about the city's financial health and political uncertainties. 

New York bonds, which have been hammered in recent weeks on the pending supply and reports that the city's economy is growing weaker, rose 1/2 point yesterday. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury bonds ended slightly higher in light trading. 

The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 102 7/32 to yield 7.92%, compared with Friday's price of 102 2/32 to yield 7.93%.
The latest 10-year notes ended at about 100 16/ 32 to yield 7.90%, compared with 100 11/32 to yield 7.93% on Friday. 

Short-term interest rates rose at the government's regular weekly Treasury-bill auction.
The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.78% and the rate on six-month bills was 7.62%.
Those rates are up from 7.52% and 7.50%, respectively, at last week's auction. 

Due to the Treasury's need to raise funds quickly before the current authority to issue debt expires at midnight tonight, yesterday's auction was structured differently from previous sales. 

The Treasury bills sold yesterday settle today, rather than the standard settlement day of Thursday.
And because of the early settlement, the three-month bills actually have a 93-day maturity, and the six-month bills have an 184-day maturity. 

Because of the early settlement, the Federal Reserve was unable to purchase bills for its system account.
However, analysts expect the Fed to buy Treasury bills that were auctioned yesterday in the secondary market. 

The Treasury also held a hastily scheduled $2 billion sale of 51-cash management bills yesterday. 

Here are details of yesterday's three-month and six-month bill auction: 

Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. 

Both issues are dated Oct. 31.
The 13-week bills mature Feb. 1, and the 26-week bills mature May 3, 1990. 

Here are details of yesterday's 51-day cash management bill auction: 

Interest rate 8.07% The bills are dated Oct. 31 and mature Dec. 21, 1989. 

Corporate Issues 

The junk bond prices of Western Union Corp. tumbled after the company said it won't proceed with an exchange offer to holders of its reset notes. 

The Upper Saddle River, N.J., communications firm said it is considering alternatives to the restructuring of the senior secured notes because of changes in the high-yield market. 

In June, Western Union was forced to reset the interest rate on the senior secured notes due in 1992 to 19 1/4% from 16 1/2%, a move which increased the firm's annual interest payments by $13.8 million.
Although the notes held at a price of 92 to 93 immediately after the reset, they started falling soon afterward. 

Yesterday, Western Union's senior secured reset notes fell 3 3/4 points, or about $37.50 for each $1,000 face amount, to close at 50 1/4.
Other Western Union securities were also lower.
The company's 7.90% sinking fund debentures were quoted at a bid price of 14 1/4 and an offered price of 30, while the 10 3/4% subordinated debentures of 1997 were being bid for at 28 and offered at around 34 3/4.
The 10 3/4% debentures last traded at 35. 

High-yield traders said spreads between the bid and offered prices of Western Union junk bonds have been widening for some time, and in certain cases, bids for Western Union securities are not available. 

Elsewhere, prices of investment-grade and high-risk, high-yield junk bonds ended unchanged. 

In the new-issue market for junk securities, underwriters at Salomon Brothers Inc. are expected to price today a $350 million junk bond offering by Beatrice Co.. 

The two-part issue consists of $200 million of senior subordinated reset notes maturing in 1997 and $150 million of subordinated floating rate notes also maturing in 1997. 

Portfolio managers said expectations are for the issue to be priced at a discount with a coupon of 13 3/4% and a yield of about 14%.
The Chicago-based food and consumer goods concern was acquired in April 1986 in a $6.2 billion leveraged buy-out engineered by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. 

Proceeds from the note sale will be used to repay a portion of the bank borrowings used by Beatrice to redeem its $526.3 million principal amount of increasing rate debentures in August. 

Meanwhile, underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co. are expected today to price a $350 million high-yield offering by Continental Cablevision Inc.
The senior subordinated debentures maturing in 2004 are targeted to be offered at a yield of between 12 5/8% to 12 3/4%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities ended 2/32 to 4/32 higher in light trading. 

Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for November delivery finished at 98 1/2, up 4/32, and its 10% issue at 102 3/8, up 4/32.
Freddie Mac's 9% issue ended at 97 19/32, up 2/32. 

In the derivative market, insurance companies have scaled back their purchases of Remic securities, or real estate mortgage investment conduits, as they assess potential claims from the recent California earthquake and hurricane in the Carolinas.
This could mean diminished issuance of derivative mortgage issues during the next few weeks. 

Insurance companies have been major buyers of prepayment-protected planned amortization classes (PACs) during the past few months.
The PACs appeal to insurance companies and other investors because they have higher yields than topgrade corporate bonds and carry the guarantee of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, quasi-federal agencies. 

In the asset-backed market, Beneficial Corp. offered $248 million of securities backed by home-equity loans, the second large deal in the past week.
Last week, a unit of MNC Financial Corp. offered $268 million of home-equity securities. 

Both the MNC and Beneficial offering were underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, the leading Wall Street firm in the home-equity securities market, which was created early this year. 

Municipal Issues 

The improved tone in the municipal market, largely an offshoot of the New York City sale's reception, helped municipal futures rebound from early lows, but the spread between the contract and Tbond futures continued to grow more negative. 

The MOB spread, or difference between the municipal and T-bond futures contracts, has been near all-time lows in recent trading, driven basically by concerns that new-issue supply would overwhelm demand. 

December municipal futures ended up 11/32 point to 92-14, having pulled off a morning low of 91-23 as cash municipals rebounded.
But front month T-bond futures settled the afternoon session up a slightly greater 13/32 at 99-04. 

Foreign Bonds 

British government bonds ended moderately higher, encouraged by a steadier pound and a rise in British stocks.
The benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 10/32 to 111 14/32 to yield 10.14%, while the Treasury's 12% notes due 1995 rose 7/32 to 103 5/8 to yield 11.04%. 

West German government bonds fell as much as 0.60 point in light, nervous trading.
The 7% Treasury bond due October 1999 ended off 0.60 point to 99.35 to yield 7.09%, while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 fell 0.35 point to 97.25 to yield 7.45%. 

Japanese government bonds continued to erode as the dollar remained resilient against the yen.
Japan's No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended the day on brokers screens at 95.11 to yield 5.43%.

Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. filed an application with Canadian regulators to build a 4.4 billion Canadian dollar (US$3.74 billion) pipeline to transport natural gas from Canada's Arctic to U.S. markets beginning in 

The application by Foothills, owned by Calgary-based Nova Corp. of Alberta and Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver, Canada, is expected to kick off what could be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still-undeveloped fields in Canada's Mackenzie River delta. 

"This is a pre-emptive strike by Foothills," said Rick Hillary, natural gas manager of the Calgary-based Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group. 

"Foothills wants to make it clear to other pipeline companies that it's on first insofar as transporting gas from the Arctic to southern markets," Mr. Hillary said. 

At least two rival applications are expected to emerge in coming months, including one from TransCanada PipeLines Ltd., Canada's largest natural gas pipeline operator.
Another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from Canada's National Energy Board to export about 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta gas to the U.S. starting in 1996. 

The producers include Shell Canada Ltd., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group; Esso Resources Canada Ltd., a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd., which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp.; and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. 

"The {National Energy Board} approval of the exports just waved the starting flag for the next stage, the rush to build facilities to transport the gas," said Bill Koerner, an analyst with Brady & Berliner, a Washington, D.C., law firm. 

Foothills' main rival to build a Mackenzie Delta pipeline is likely to be TransCanada PipeLines.
The Toronto-based company, together with Tenneco Inc. of Houston, has had an incomplete proposal filed with Canadian regulators since 1984 that it is now updating. 

Like Foothills, TransCanada's Polar Gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the Mackenzie River delta in Canada's western Arctic with an initial capacity to transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily.
Industry sources said they expect a fierce battle to emerge between TransCanada, which has a monopoly on Canadian gas transportation east of Alberta, and Nova and Westcoast, which control the pipelines within and running west of Alberta, respectively. 

"This is virgin territory, unclaimed, and it's going to be nasty," said one observer, who asked not to be named. "Neither is going to back down easily." 

TransCanada declined to comment on the Foothills application.
But last week Gerald Maier, president and chief executive officer of TransCanada, said the company "intends to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there" and that it would consider joint ventures with other players to ensure it has a role. 

A number of issues still need to be resolved before Canadian regulators give any project the final go-ahead. 

First, the price of natural gas will have to almost double.
Kent Jesperson, president of Foothills, said the company believes the project would be viable if gas prices reach US$3.25 a thousand cubic feet by 1995, in current dollars, up from a current spot price of about US$1.50. 

Mr. Jesperson's US$3.25 estimate is somewhat below the $3.39 floor price that Calgary-based consulting firm Paul Ziff & Co. recently said would be needed for Mackenzie delta gas producers to see a return on their investment. 

U.S. gas buyers must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for Mackenzie delta gas or develop Alaskan reserves in the Prudhoe Bay area first, a project that has been on hold for more than a decade. 

Robert Pierce, chairman and chief executive of Foothills, said it's too early to say whether Alaskan or Mackenzie delta gas would flow to market first.
But Foothills said it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line, the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System further north toward Alaska.
If that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators, Foothills said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting Mackenzie Delta reserves to the Alaska mainline. 

It's also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects.
Douglas Stoneman, vice president of Shell Canada, noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development. 

Interprovincial Pipe Line Co., an oil pipeline operator rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own, said that isn't in the cards.
Instead, Richard Haskayne, president and chief executive of Interprovincial's Calgary-based parent, Interhome Energy Inc., said the company would prefer to work with other "interested parties" on a joint proposal. 

As for Foothills' pre-emptive bid, Mr. Haskayne said, "If they think it gives them some kind of priority position, well, that's their strategy." 

Rymer Foods Inc. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as 500,000 of its common stock purchase warrants at a price of $4 a warrant. 

The food company, which has 720,000 warrants and about 2.9 million common shares outstanding, said it may increase the offer to purchase any or all warrants that are properly tendered.
A warrant permits a holder to acquire one share of common stock for $17.50 a share.
The warrants expire on Oct. 15, 1992, and may be called by the company at a price of $5.25. 

The offer is scheduled to expire on Nov. 28, unless extended.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Rymer closed yesterday at $10.875, down 12.5 cents. 

GREAT NORTHERN NEKOOSA is being sought by another big paper company, Georgia-Pacific, for $58 a share, or about $3.18 billion.
The tender offer, which surprised analysts because it appeared to be unsolicited, could spark a period of industry consolidation.
Analysts questioned whether Georgia-Pacific will ultimately prevail, saying other paper concerns may make competing bids. 

Two more securities firms bowed to the outcry over program trading.

Applause for "Sometimes, Talk Is the Best Medicine," in your Oct. 5 Marketplace section. 

Indeed, the "art of doctoring" does contribute to better health results and discourages unwarranted malpractice litigation. 

Elaborating on the concern about doctors' sacrificing earnings in order to spend "talk time" with patients, we are finding the quality of the time spent is the key to true rapport.
Even brief conversations can show caring and trust, and need not restrict the efficiency of the communication or restrain the doctor's earnings. 

The issue is far-reaching.
Right now, the American populace is spending about 12% of our gross national product on health care.
That amounts to more than $350 billion a year.
And it is estimated that more than 20% of that, $70 billion, goes to "defensive medicine" -- those measures taken by doctors to protect themselves from the most unlikely possibilities. 

So we all stand to benefit if patient-physician relations become a "partnership."

Part of a Series} 

Tom Panelli had a perfectly good reason for not using the $300 rowing machine he bought three years ago. "I ate a bad tuna sandwich, got food poisoning and had to have a shot in my shoulder," he says, making it too painful to row. 

The soreness, he admits, went away about a week after the shot.
Yet the rowing machine hasn't been touched since, even though he has moved it across the country with him twice.
A San Francisco lawyer, Mr. Panelli rowed religiously when he first got the machine, but, he complains, it left grease marks on his carpet, "and it was boring.
It's a horrible machine, actually.
I'm ashamed I own the stupid thing." 

Mr. Panelli has plenty of company.
Nearly three-fourths of the people who own home exercise equipment don't use it as much as they planned, according to The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey.
The Roper Organization, which conducted the survey, said almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected. 

It isn't just exercise gear that isn't getting a good workout.
The fitness craze itself has gone soft, the survey found.
Fewer people said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging, tennis, swimming and aerobics.
Half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise. 

That's good news for marketers of walking shoes.
The survey also detected a bit more interest in golf, a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers. 

The survey's findings certainly aren't encouraging for marketers of health-club memberships, tennis rackets and home exercise equipment, but people's good intentions, if not their actions, are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy. 

For instance, sales of treadmills, exercise bikes, stair climbers and the like are expected to rise 8% to about $1.52 billion this year, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s. 

But even that group knows some people don't use their machines as much as they should. "The first excuse is they don't have enough time," says research director Thomas Doyle. "The second is they don't have enough discipline." With more than 15 million exercise bikes sold in the past five years, he adds, "a lot of garages, basements and attics must be populated with them." 

Still, the average price of such bikes rose last year to $145.
Mr. Doyle predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices.
Electronic gimmicks are key.
Premark International Inc., for example, peddles the M8.7sp Electronic Cycling Simulator, a $2,000 stationary cycle.
On a video screen, riders can see 30 different "rides," including urban, mountain and desert scenes, and check how many calories are burned a minute. 

Nancy Igdaloff, who works in corporate payments at Bank of America in San Francisco, may be a good prospect for such a gizmo.
She's trying to sell a $150 exercise bike she bought about five years ago for her roommate.
But rather than write off home fitness equipment, she traded up: Ms. Igdaloff just paid about $900 for a fancier stationary bike, with a timer, dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that feels almost like a chair. "I'm using it a lot," she says. "I spent so much money that if I look at it, and I'm not on it, I feel guilty." 

The poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say and what they do.
A surprising 78% of people said they exercise regularly, up from 73% in 1981.
This conjures up images of a nation full of trim, muscular folks, and suggests couch potatoes are out of season.
Of course, that isn't really the case.
The discrepancy may be because asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like inquiring about their love life.
They're bound to exaggerate. 

"People say they swim, and that may mean they've been to the beach this year," says Krys Spain, research specialist for the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. "It's hard to know if people are responding truthfully.
People are too embarrassed to say they haven't done anything." 

While she applauds the fact that more Americans are getting up from the television to stroll or garden, she says the percentage of Americans who do "real exercise to build the heart" is only 10% to 20%.
So many people fudge on answers about exercise, the president's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous: It must produce contractions of large muscle groups, must achieve 60% of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes. 

One of the council's goals, set in 1980, was to see more than 60% of adults under 65 years of age getting vigorous exercise by 1990.
That target has been revised to 30% by the year 2000. 

But even that goal may prove optimistic.
Of 14 activities, the Journal survey found that 12 -- including bicycling, skiing and swimming -- are being done by fewer Americans today than eight years ago.
Time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline. 

Only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s -- and only slightly.
Jeanette Traverso, a California lawyer, gave up running three times a week to play a weekly round of golf, finding it more social and serene.
It's an activity she feels she can do for life, and by pulling a golf cart, she still gets a good workout. "I'm really wiped out after walking five hours," she says. 

Most people said they exercise both for health and enjoyment. "If you sit down all the time, you'll go stiff," says Joyce Hagood, a Roxboro, N.C., homemaker who walks several miles a week. "And it's relaxing.
Sometimes, if you have a headache, you can go out and walk it right off." 

Only about a quarter of the respondents said they exercise to lose weight.
Slightly more, like Leslie Sherren, a law librarian in San Francisco who attends dance aerobics five times a week, exercise to relieve stress. "Working with lawyers," she says, "I need it." 

But fully 90% of those polled felt they didn't need to belong to a health club. "They're too crowded, and everybody's showing off," says Joel Bryant, a 22-year-old student from Pasadena, Calif. "The guys are being macho, and the girls are walking around in little things.
They're not there to work out." 

But at least they show up.
Nearly half of those who joined health clubs said they didn't use their membership as often as they planned.
Feeling they should devote more time to their families or their jobs, many yuppies are skipping their once-sacred workout. 

Even so, the Association of Quality Clubs, a health-club trade group in Boston, says membership revenues will rise about 5% this year from last year's $5 billion.
A spokeswoman adds, however, that the group is considering offering "a behavior-modification course, similar to a smoking-cessation program, to teach people ways to stay with it." 

There are die-hard bodies, of course.
The proprietor of Sante West, an aerobics studio in San Francisco's Marina district, which was hit hard by the earthquake, says, "People were going nuts the minute we opened," three days after the quake. "The emotional aspect is so draining, they needed a good workout." 

Perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may be an endangered American institution.
The survey reported the number of people who said they bowl regularly has fallen to just 8% from 17% in 1981.
The American Bowling Congress claims a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly, but concedes its membership has declined this decade. 

To find out why, the group recently commissioned a study of the past 20 years of bowling-related research.
Three reasons were pinpointed: a preference for watching bowling and other sports on television rather than actually bowling, dowdy bowling centers, and dissatisfaction with bowling itself.
People who start bowling expecting it to be a pleasurable exercise "have been generally disappointed," the report said. 

But not Richard Cottrell, a San Francisco cab driver who bowls in two weekly leagues.
He hit the lanes three years ago on the advice of his doctor. 

"It's good exercise," he says. "I can't do anything score-wise, but I like meeting the girls." He says bowling helps him shed pounds, though that effort is sometimes thwarted by the fact that "when I'm drinking, I bowl better." His Tuesday night team, the Leftovers, is in first place. 

(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

MAY 1, 1975, SIGNALED A DISTRESSFUL May Day for securities houses, which were forced to end 183 years of charging fixed commissions.
It scared brokers, but most survived. 

It took effect after seven years of bitter debate between the Securities and Exchange Commission and traders and exchanges.
Despite warnings from such leaders as former Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin that unfixed commissions would undo the industry, the SEC in September 1973 said full competition must start May l, 1975. 

The timing for change was right.
Institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought exchange seats to handle their own trades.
And the industry was rife with brokers trying to secure big client orders by using kickbacks, gifts, women and junkets. 

Within three weeks of the 1975 end to fixed rates there were all-out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business, with rate slashes of 35% to 60% below pre-May 1 levels.
Ray Garrett Jr., SEC chairman, said the "breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected." Even a federal measure in June allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions didn't stop it. 

Longer term, the impact is unclear.
The change prompted the rise of discount brokers and a reduction in securities research firms.
But there are currently more exchange members than in 1975, with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions.
Commissions, however, account for a smaller share of investment-house business as takeover advisory fees have soared. 

Foreign stock markets, with which the U.S. is entwined, also have ended fixed commissions in recent years.
It came in London's "Big Bang" 1986 deregulation; and Toronto's "Little Bang" the same year.
Paris is currently phasing out fixed commissions under its "Le Petit Bang" plan. 

Private housing starts in Japan were unchanged in September from a year earlier at 144,610 units, the Construction Ministry said. 

The flat report followed a four-month string of declines.
The down trend was partly the result of tighter credit sparked by a discount rate increase by the Bank of Japan in May. 

The central bank also unexpectedly raised the base rate by half a percentage point to 3.75% Oct. 11 as part of an inflation-fighting move that indirectly increases interest rates charged on new home construction loans. 

It can be hoped that Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory Sunday.
A strong challenge from the far left, the Communist coalition Izquierda Unida, failed to topple him.
He should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth-oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left.
If he follows the correct path, he may be able to look back on this election as the high-water mark of far-left opposition. 

The far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for dealing with them.
It could point to plenty of ailments that the Spanish economic rejuvenation so far has failed to cure.
Unemployment still is officially recorded at 16.5%, the highest rate in Europe, although actual joblessness may be lower.
Housing is scarce and public services -- the court system, schools, mail service, telephone network and the highways -- are in disgraceful condition.
Large pockets of poverty still exist. 

The left also is critical of the style of the Socialist government -- a remarkable parallel to the situation in Britain.
Mr. Gonzalez and his colleagues, particularly the finance minister, Carlos Solchaga, are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant elitists who refuse even to go on television (controlled by the state) to face their accusers.
In response to this, the Socialist prime minister has simply cited his free-market accomplishments. 

They are very considerable: Since 1986, when Spain joined the European Community, its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of 4.6% -- the fastest in the EC.
In that time more than 1.2 million jobs have been created and the official jobless rate has been pushed below 17% from 21%.
A 14% inflation rate dropped below 5%.
Net foreign investment through August this year has been running at a pace of $12.5 billion, about double the year-earlier rate.
Mr. Gonzalez also has split with the left in reaffirming Spain's NATO commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the U.S. 

Mr. Gonzalez is not quite a closet supply-side revolutionary, however.
He did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes. 

Yet the best the far-left could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc -- nearly 40% -- from endorsing the direction Spain is taking.
Now he can go further.
He should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income, in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher, not lower, revenues.
He could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers, thus making funds available for public services starved of money for six years. 

The voters delivered Mr. Gonzalez a third mandate for his successes.
They, as well as numerous Latin American and East European countries that hope to adopt elements of the Spanish model, are supporting the direction Spain is taking.
It would be sad for Mr. Gonzalez to abandon them to appease his foes. 

Genentech Inc. said the West German distributor of its heart drug TPA reached a joint marketing agreement with a subsidiary of Hoechst AG, which makes the rival anti-clotting agent streptokinase. 

The biotechnology concern said the agreement between its longtime West German distributor, Boehringer-Ingleheim's Dr. Karl Thomae G.m.b.
H. subsidiary, and Hoechst's Behringwerke subsidiary was an attempt to expand the market for blood-clot drugs in general. 

A Genentech spokeswoman said the agreement calls for Hoechst to promote TPA for heart patients and streptokinase for other clot-reducing purposes. 

President Bush said that three members of his cabinet will lead a presidential mission to Poland to gauge how the U.S. can help the new non-Communist government's economic changes. 

Mr. Bush announced several weeks ago that he intended to send such a mission, composed of top government aides and business and labor leaders.
The mission will visit Poland from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2, the White House said. 

In remarks at a White House ceremony marking Polish Heritage Month, Mr. Bush announced that Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole will lead the U.S. group.
Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, also will be a member. 

In addition, the White House said that Charles Harper, chairman of ConAgra Inc., and John McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., will be among a group of at least 15 business and labor representatives in the presidential mission.
Mr. Bush said the group is to "focus on economic sectors where U.S. expertise and cooperation can indeed make a difference." 

Mr. Bush has asked Congress to provide more than $400 million in economic aid and food grants for Poland's new government, but has been chided by Democrats for failing to do more. 

Lone Star Technologies Inc. said its Lone Star Steel Co. unit sued it in federal court here, seeking to recover an intercompany receivable valued at a minimum of $23 million. 

The lawsuit was filed by Lone Star Steel's unsecured creditors' committee on behalf of Lone Star Steel, which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since June 30. 

Lone Star Technologies said it and its subsidiary's creditors agree that the parent company owes the unit money, but they haven't been able to reach agreement on the amount. 

Judith Elkin, lawyer for the creditors, said the creditors group is challenging certain accounting entries on the parent company's books and estimates that the receivable owed the steel company could be as much as $40 million. 

The Lone Star Steel lawsuit also asks the court to rule that Lone Star Technologies is jointly responsible for a $4.5 million Lone Star Steel pension payment that was due, but wasn't paid, in September and that the parent company can't recover the amount from its subsidiary if the parent company makes the payment. 

Separately, Lone Star Technologies said the bankruptcy court granted Lone Star Steel an extension until year end on its exclusive period to present a reorganization plan.
The 120-day exclusivity period was to expire yesterday. 

Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate, but is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debt. 

Rupert Murdoch acquired a 25% stake in Grupo Zeta S.A., the leading Spanish magazine and newspaper publisher said. 

The transaction called for Mr. Murdoch's News International PLC, a unit of Australia-based News Corp., to subscribe to a rights issue by Zeta valued at 6.65 billion pesetas ($57 million).
Also participating in the issue was Servifilm Spain Cinematografica S.A.
The film producer, owned by Madrid-based financier Jacques Hachuel, received a 5% stake in the Barcelona-based publishing group. 

The cash injection boosted Zeta's capital more than four-fold, to 8.47 billion pesetas from 1.82 billion pesetas, greatly enhancing the group's ability to make investments, Zeta officials said.
Following its failure last month to win a license for one of Spain's first three private television stations, Zeta is seeking investment opportunities in communications and publishing. 

With annual sales of about 30 billion pesetas, Zeta publishes over a dozen magazines, including the popular Tiempo, Interviu and Panorama, and three regional dailies.
Chairman Antonio Asensio will retain a 70% share in Zeta. 

Consolidated Freightways Inc. reported a 77% drop in third-quarter net income, citing expected losses in its Emery Worldwide shipping business. 

The Menlo Park, Calif., company said net was $7.4 million, or 22 cents a share, down from $32.3 million, or 86 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue totaled $1.01 billion, a 43% increase from $704.4 million, reflecting the company's acquisition of Emery earlier this year. 

Profit also suffered because of "intense" discounting in its long-haul trucking business, the company said. 

Analysts had expected Consolidated to post a slim profit, and the company's stock was down only 25 cents to $30.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. "They have to continue to tighten their belts," said Craig Kloner, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. received a $65 million contract to outfit Continental Airlines' 393 planes with the Bendix/King Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System. 

The airborne system operates independent of ground-based radar systems, informing pilots of nearby aircraft, Allied-Signal said.
The system also provides course-correction advisories. 

Allied-Signal is a unit of Allied-Signal Inc., a manufacturer with interests in aerospace, automotive products and engineered materials.
Continental Airlines is a unit of Texas Air Corp., Houston. 

Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted. 

The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate.

Japan is going on a capital-spending binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder to shrink. 

Its capital spending is growing at double-digit rates for the second year in a row, and its superefficient producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity, modernize factories and develop new products. 

"The boom's so huge," says Mitsuru Saito, an economist at Sanwa Research Institute, "it makes you think of the Golden '60s," when Japan developed rapidly. 

The more factories and robots Japanese manufacturers add, the more they will be able to export, and the less their domestic customers will need to import. 

At Canon Inc., for example, sales are up nearly 20% this year; so, the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any Japanese company would do under the circumstances: It is increasing capital spending -- by 60%.
It is building, among other things, a new laser-beam-printer factory in western Japan that can produce up to 150,000 printers next year.
Some 70% of them are to be exported to the U.S. 

Even companies in smokestack industries wrestling with world-wide overcapacity are joining the boom.
Japan's steelmakers are raising capital spending 22% this year to $4.8 billion.
Hitachi Zosen Corp., a shipbuilder buried in debt just a few years ago, will build a machinery plant, its first expansion in 14 years. 

So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies' outlays in Japan topped American companies' domestic outlays by $521.4 billion to $494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though Japan's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds America's. 

From a financial standpoint, the boom couldn't come at a better time.
Many Japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year, and Japanese interest rates, though up a bit recently, are still low.
And in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends, companies can plow their profits back into plant and equipment. 

But some economists and government officials here aren't applauding.
They fear that the boom may be too big for Japan's or anyone else's good. "It's an explosive cocktail" thrown at the world, says Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at the Tokyo unit of Deutsche Bank Group.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging Japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending.
MITI officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the U.S. even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the U.S. 

Not everyone is worried, however.
Some economists -- and many Japanese companies -- are puzzled by the warnings.
The investment boom is mainly sparked, they say, by strong domestic demand and isn't likely to increase exports sharply. 

Moreover, much investment isn't aimed at increasing capacity.
According to a survey of some 2,400 large companies by the Japan Development Bank, expanded capacity is the goal of just 51.8% of the outlays; for manufacturers alone, the figure is 32%.
The manufacturers said 14.2% of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones, 17.5% is to cut costs, 12.5% is for research and development, and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes. 

But the worriers remain unconvinced.
With Japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world, they think that Japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more.
And eventually, they contend, domestic demand will weaken, forcing companies to emphasize exports again. "If there's a further drive to export," says Nobuyuki Arai, an economist at the Japan Development Bank, "that'll be a problem." 

Even in the short run, the investment boom could exacerbate a disturbing trend: Japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease.
Japanese auto makers, for example, are increasing their production capacity in the U.S.; the additional production should, in part, replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones.
But although Japanese companies increased their U.S. auto output by 42% from January to September compared with the year-earlier period, their exports to the U.S. will drop only 9% this year, Nikko Research Center estimates. 

In contrast to previous economic booms, Japanese auto companies aren't just trying to boost production.
Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and, to some extent, to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from South Korea and Taiwan.
Others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once.
So many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that Fanuc Ltd., a robot maker, also had to build a new plant.
The buildup is "making Japan clearly more efficient, more technologically advanced and more competitive," declares a Western diplomat in Tokyo. 

But whatever its effects on exports and imports, Japan's investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand.
Japan's marathon economy, growing at 4.3% this year, is now in its 35th month of expansion, and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s. 

Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money, especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars.
Nissan Motor Co. 's domestic auto sales are up 20% this year largely because its expensive Cima, Sylvia and Cefiro models are in heavy demand. 

"One dealer told me that if he had more cars, he'd sell them right away," says Takuro Endo, Nissan executive vice president.
He adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand "by overworking" its employees.
Similarly, Honda Motor Co. 's sales are so brisk that workers grumble they haven't had a Saturday off in years, despite the government's encouragement of more leisure activity. 

With demand growing and workers in short supply, many Japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on automation.
Among them are the shipbuilders, which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market.
Sasebo Heavy Industries Co., a medium-sized shipbuilder, expects its sales to increase 30% this year, largely because of rising demand for oil tankers. 

Once one Japanese company steps up its investments, the whole industry follows.
Because most businesses put market share above profitability, to let a competitor's addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat. 

The emphasis on market share is evident at Daikin Industries Ltd., Japan's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners.
Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar, Daikin is building another plant, which will lift its production capacity 50%.
The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company's market share to 30% from 27% currently.
Besides, Daikin's major competitors, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., "are all adding production lines," a Daikin spokesman says. "Until now, we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had.
But we can't produce enough anymore." 

The competition is even more heated in the auto industry, where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market.
Nissan aims to expand its 25% share of the market to 30% by spending $141 million on a plant in southern Japan that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year.
Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp. 's $247 million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by 180,000 cars, and Honda is spending $317 million on expansion.
Mazda Motor Corp. is still considering its options, but it boldly aims to double its annual domestic sales to 800,000 cars in the next four years. 

Those who aren't worried about how Japanese manufacturers' investments will affect trade note that many new products aren't replacements for imports.
Although imports account for less than 1% of beer sales in Japan, Asahi Breweries Ltd., which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer, plans to fend off Japanese competitors by pouring $1.06 billion into facilities to brew 50% more beer.
But new-product development will make Japanese companies stronger, and big investments in "domestic" industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the Japanese market. 

Moreover, much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which Japanese companies have only limited foreign competition; so, more investment practically assures more exports.
Toshiba Corp., for example, is spending $986 million on two new plants to build four-megabit dynamic random access memories, the next generation of computer chips.
The product isn't widely used yet, but Toshiba, which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit DRAMs, believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again. "It's important to gain leadership," a Toshiba spokesman says. 

Meanwhile, Toshiba's Japanese rivals, Hitachi, Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp., aren't sitting still.
After doubling production in one plant, NEC is spending $275 million to build another plant that, in two years, will be able to make a million four-megabit DRAMs a year.
The new chip plants "won't be excessive investment," says Hajime Sasaki, an NEC vice president. "We have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products." 

Some of Japan's goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas.
Toyota's $35,000 Lexus automobile, a luxury model that it started shipping to the U.S. only last month, is racking up orders at a time when U.S.-made luxury-car sales are slow.
Toyota plans to raise Lexus exports when a new plant starts up next year. 

What if its sales weaken someday?
Japanese companies have a caveat competitor attitude.
If excess capacity develops, they say, not everyone will suffer.
The losers will be those with the least attractive products, and many of them, analysts think, will be foreign companies. 

Toshiba Corp. said its new French marketing concern has started operating under the aegis of the company's West German subsidiary, which formerly handled all sales of Toshiba electronic products in France. 

A recent change in French law, according to Toshiba, permitted formation of the semiconductor marketing arm in Paris. 

Hughes Aircraft Co., a General Motors Corp. unit, said the Intelsat VI commercial communications satellite is set to be launched Friday. 

The satellite, built by Hughes for the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, is part of a $700 million contract awarded to Hughes in 1982 to develop five of the three-ton satellites. 

Lawrence Insurance Group Inc. said it acquired United Republic Reinsurance Co., a Houston property and casualty reinsurance company, from United Savings Association of Texas for $28 million. 

Lawrence Insurance also sold 3.2 million of its shares for $7.125 each to its parent, Lawrence Group Inc. Lawrence Insurance, based in Albany, N.Y., plans to use the $22.5 million in proceeds to help finance the acquisition of United Republic. 

By acquiring the shares, Lawrence Group increased its stake in Lawrence Insurance to 93.2% from 91.2%.
Lawrence Insurance underwrites mostly primary insurance, a company spokesman said.
A reinsurance company effectively insures insurance companies that wish to spread the risk of a particular policy. 

Lawrence Group also owns Lawrence Agency Corp., Schenectady, N.Y., an insurance agency and brokerage. 

One day last March, CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and Olympics superagent Barry Frank met for lunch at the Lotos Club here.
Mr. Frank told Mr. Pilson that Olympics officials wanted $290 million or more for TV rights to the 1994 Winter Games in Norway.
The CBS official said that price sounded fine. 

At that price, CBS was the only player at the table when negotiations with the International Olympic Committee started in Toronto Aug. 23.
Dick Pound, a committee member, began by disclosing that ABC and NBC had refused to even bid.
Then, he asked Mr. Pilson to raise his offer anyway: "If we can have a number that starts with a three, you can have a dea." 

Mr. Pilson and his team huddled in a hallway and took just 10 minutes to return with a $300 million offer.
Mr. Pound responded, "It's a deal." A beaming Mr. Pilson announced his lastest coup at a news conference that afternoon. 

Mr. Pilson's rivals at ABC and NBC grimaced at the price.
How could CBS get pushed into outbidding itself?
Well, CBS, mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out, wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid.
But Mr. Pilson has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights, a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid. 

"The price of poker has gone up," crows Charles M. Neinas, the College Football Association's executive director. 

With CBS Inc. on a spending spree that may top $2.5 billion for four years of major sports events, the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business.
CBS itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong.
ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. also risk losses if they outbid CBS for other contracts. 

While rights fees head skyward, ad rates won't.
Advertisers already are balking at higher prices. "The networks are paying too much for rights," warns adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam. "If they ask advertisers to absorb the costs, they're likely to lose all but a few who need sports, above all." 

Viewers may not be cheering, either.
Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials.
At the same time, some sports events will move off "free" television and onto cable or pay-cable, where half the nation's TV homes can't see them. 

CBS has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids -- that is, can the network alone make a profit on it?
Mr. Pilson emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press, contented affiliate stations, enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other CBS programs when the game is over.
The billion-dollar question is, How much are those benefits worth? 

Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do, they won't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that CBS could run up. "As we've seen in the '80s," says Roger Werner, the president of the ESPN sports channel, "those deals can turn sour if the numbers don't work.
And three years later, in a sea of red ink, the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do." 

CBS pursues top sports "to belie the fact that they aren't supporting affiliates, viewers and advertisers," charges Thomas H. Wyman, who was ousted as chairman of CBS Inc. after Laurence A. Tisch bought a 24.9% stake in the company and took over three years ago. "They lost the entertainment crown, and they needed one.
And they've bought one." 

On just three big deals -- for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- Pilson bid a total of $1.64 billion.
That's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing to pay. (After 1992, the winter and summer Olympics will be held two years apart, with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996.) 

Now, Mr. Pilson -- a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs "a level offocus and intellectual attention" similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness.
Next month, talks will begin on two coveted CBS contracts, for the pro and college basketball finals.
CBS is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them.
The potential bill: more than $600 million for several seasons, an 80% jump.
A few months later, CBS's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal; they could go for close to $100 million more than CBS now pays, a 40% to 50% rise. 

"What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports," says Peter Lund, a former CBS Sports president now at Multimedia Inc. J. William Grimes, former president of ESPN, says NBC may "come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say, 'We can overbid, too. ' And the winners will be the colleges, not either network.
Nor, by the way, advertisers." 

Mr. Pilson is an unlikely big spender.
In the mid-1980s, after ABC had just bid a record $309 million for the 1988 Winter Games, he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices. "I love Pilson, but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly," says Robert Wussler, a former CBS Sports president. "And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today." Rivals carp at "the principle of Pilson," as NBC's Arthur Watson once put it -- "he's always expounding that rights are too high, then he's going crazy." 

But the 49-year-old Mr. Pilson is hardly a man to ignore the numbers.
A Yale law school graduate, he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at Metromedia Inc. and the William Morris talent agency.
In 1976, he joined CBS Sports to head business affairs and, five years later, became its president. 

Mr. Pilson says that when he spoke out a few years ago, "I didn't say forever, and I didn't say every property." The market changed, he adds.
And he isn't the only big spender: NBC will pay a record $401 million for the 1992 Summer Games, and ESPN, 80%-owned by Capital Cities/ABC, will shell out $400 million for four years of baseball, airing 175 regular-season games a year. 

"Our competitors say we overbid them.
Who cares?
Maybe we recognize values the other guys don't," Mr. Pilson says. 

Mr. Pilson's "Major Events" strategy jelled after Mr. Tisch took over.
Mr. Pilson recalls that in April 1986, after CBS's annual meeting in Philadelphia, he and Mr. Tisch took the 90-minute train ride back to New York, and Mr. Pilson used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions.
Mr. Tisch, a billionaire in hotels and finance, was just learning the TV business.
Five months later, Mr. Tisch took over as CBS's chief executive, and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. Pilson scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper, sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators. 

Then, in May 1988, Mr. Tisch urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network.
Mr. Pilson gave him one: He bid $243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France; ABC and NBC wouldn't bid even $200 million.
That started the still-raging bidding wars. 

The "Major Events" strategy, Mr. Pilson says, is designed to notch a place for CBS on the crowded TV dial of the 1990s.
It's also a fast fix for an ailing image.
He sees flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs, grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later.
Next October, CBS, for the first time, won't have to start the season against the much-watched American and National baseball league championships and the World Series. 

"I've been struggling against that for years," says Jonathan Rodgers, who runs WBBM-TV, the CBS-owned station in Chicago.
Even if baseball triggers losses at CBS -- and he doesn't think it will -- "I'd rather see the games on our air than on NBC and ABC," he says. 

That isn't surprising.
Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years, and premiering new shows is "a crap shoot," Mr. Pilson says.
But top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences 30% or 40% larger than those CBS usually gets. 

Mr. Pilson says baseball and the Olympics may help CBS move up to No. 2 in the household ratings race, putting pizazz back into the network's image.
And the Winter Olympics will air during the February "sweeps," when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations. 

That will please once-grumpy affiliates -- another aim of the Pilson plan.
They gleefully await the "dream season" in 1990.
CBS will air the Super Bowl, baseball playoffs, college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events. "It's made me more committed to CBS," says Philip A. Jones, the president of Meredith Corp. 's broadcast group, which has two CBS affiliates. 

The CBS plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success, however.
No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak. "In this market of 40 channels, sophisticated viewers and the remote control, trial isn't a guarantee of anything," ESPN's Mr. Werner says. "If the show ain't a killer, they're gone." 

During the 1984 Summer Games, for example, ABC touted "Call to Glory," but the military drama was missing in action within weeks.
Last October, during the 1988 Summer Games, NBC relentlessly pitched a new series, "Tattingers." It belly-flopped anyway. 

Moreover, sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women.
Though CBS might move up to No. 2 in household ratings, most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged 18 to 49.
CBS may remain a distant No. 3 in that regard. 

Nor is CBS a shoo-in to get blockbuster ratings.
In recent years, the World Series and the Olympics were aired against CBS's last-place lineup.
But CBS will put the athletes up against Bill Cosby, "Cheers" and other shows in NBC's No. 1 schedule. 

Even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited.
The sports lineup may add only 1% to 5% to a station's annual profits.
It alone isn't likely to stop a station from dumping CBS shows. "The World Series, seven nights, wasn't enough of an incentive," says Arnold Klinsky of WHEC-TV in Rochester, which dropped CBS for NBC six weeks ago. "You've got to judge where the network will be in three years." 

The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if CBS can't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself.
And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort.
On the $1.06 billion baseball agreement alone, CBS is likely to lose $250 million in four years, contends Mr. Wussler, the former CBS man, now at Comsat Inc. Nevertheless, he deems the deal "plain smart" for its huge promotional value. 

Mr. Pilson calls that loss estimate "wildly inaccurate," conceding only that CBS will lose money on baseball in the first year. "It's too early to tell" what happens after that, he says.
But Mr. Tisch expects losses in all four years of the contract, he told U.S. senators last June. 

CBS will pay an average of $82 million more each year than ABC and NBC had paid together -- and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season.
Yet CBS will air only 12 regular-season games, 26 fewer than ABC and NBC.
That has outraged some fans.
It also indicates a $50 million drop in ad sales for regular-season games -- a risk CBS took to get an unprecedented lock on all playoff games.
If the playoffs end in four-game sweeps, losses could soar. 

Advertisers are resisting higher prices, which would help close the gap.
CBS signed General Motors and Toyota to be the only auto-maker sponsors in baseball for four years.
Price: $265 million.
But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $275,000 for a 30-second ad in the World Series through 1993 -- 17% less than what ABC is charging for the Series this month.
Moreover, "there's no question ad rates will come down considerably" from the GM-Toyota price, says Arnold Chase of Bozell Inc. Other admen, however, say rates could rise later if ad spending surges. 

The Winter Games outlook also is mixed.
CBS expects to make modest profits, but rivals contend that it will take a beating.
ABC lost $75 million on the 1988 Winter Games, partly because of its $309 million rights fee.
It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers. 

CBS will add 25 1/2 hours to that load in 1992, and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events.
All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with Norway, so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news. (Turner Broadcasting will pay CBS $25 million to air 50 hours of CBS coverage plus 50 hours of additional events.) 

Barry Frank, the agent who took Mr. Pilson to lunch last March, says that even if CBS loses, say, $10 million, it matters little. "Ten million ain't jack, man, when you got $3 billion sitting in the bank," says Mr. Frank, senior vice president at International Management Group, citing CBS's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses. "It doesn't mean anything -- it's public-relations money." 

Moreover, sports has "claimed its place" as a guaranteed ratings-getter, says David J. Stern, the commissioner of the National Basketball Association. "This isn't outlandish bidding; this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it. . . . I would tend to trust their judgment." 

That's easy for him to say: CBS's four-year NBA pact, now at $176 million for four years, could double in price by the time his talks with Mr. Pilson are completed later this month.
That would cut into CBS's slim margin for profit -- and error.
CBS Sports earned $50 million or so last year.
And CBS takes in the least money in prime time; ABC and NBC charge 30% to 35% more for ads, according to a Variety survey. 

But CBS's costs are huge, and the risks go up with each new sports package that CBS locks up.
Although sports officials predict jumps of 50% to 100% in the major contracts coming up for renewal, ad rates may rise only 20%.
CBS hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time.
But the savings will be minuscule.
Each hour of Olympics and baseball in prime time will cost CBS $2.6 million to $2.8 million; an hour-long drama costs only $900,000, and it is aired twice. 

CBS may cushion losses with about $200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling CBS Records and other businesses.
But media-stock analyst Richard J. MacDonald of MacDonald Grippo Riely says Wall Street won't take kindly to that. "On a stand-alone basis, the network ought to make money," he says. 

When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this? -- he doesn't exactly say yes. "What you're really asking is, Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management?" he says.
Then, he answers his own question. "Yes, they are.
That's the only question we need to address." 

Beghin-Say S.A. said that it plans to sell its remaining paper operations by the end of January as part of a drive to refocus on the food sector and lower its debt. 

The French unit of Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria also disclosed a 40% rise in its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1989, excluding nonrecurring items and after payments to minority interests. 

Beghin-Say said the sale will be done in two parts and will raise a total of 2.025 billion francs ($325 million).
This will include the sale of its interest in the joint venture Beghin Corbehem to Feldemuehle AG.
The West German paper company entered the venture in April 1988 by acquiring a 50% stake, also from Beghin-Say. 

The other part of the transaction will see Beghin-Say sell its 50% stake in its Kaysersberg paper affiliate to an unspecified unit of the petrochemical group Montedison S.p.
A., which is also controlled by Ferruzzi. 

And in a separate transaction, Beghin-Say will sell its remaining 25% interest in A.T.B., a holding company for international trading assets, to an unspecified unit of Ferruzzi for 258 million francs. 

Sun Microsystems Inc. said Prime Computer Inc. has agreed to resell as much as $200 million worth of Sun's machines over the next two years. 

The computers use the company's own microprocessor called Sparc, Sun said. 

Cie.
Generale des Eaux reported that net profit climbed 30% in the first half of 1989 and said that it expects a gain of about 25% for the full year. 

The French water treatment group said consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests rose to 749 million francs (US$119.2 million) from 575 million francs in the first half of 1988.
Revenue climbed 13% to 45.4 billion francs from 40.1 billion. 

Generale des Eaux said the earnings gain was led by its water, energy and building activities. 

Coda Energy Inc. said it completed the sale of Phenix-Transmission Co. to Bishop Pipeline Co., for $17 million in cash and notes. 

Coda, an oil and gas concern, said it and its partners received $7 million in cash and $10 million in five-year notes for the Kansas intrastate pipeline.
Coda owned 60% of the pipeline and private entities owned the rest. 

Bishop is based in Hutchinson, Kansas. 

The New York Stock Exchange is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today, just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up. 

The Big Board this morning plans to begin trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio "basket" product, the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange's seal of approval.
ESPs will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor's index in a single trade of a minimum of $5 million. "Customized" baskets of fewer stocks will also be available. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday.
The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, where the minimum will be $1.7 million.
Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange. 

The basket products are "an evolutionary step" in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash, said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest. 

New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, overseeing his first public meeting, said there have been concerns that the Big Board's basket could attract investors with a "short-term perspective" who would rapidly turn over the product, thus increasing volatility. 

But Richard Ketchum, the SEC's market regulation chief, said he didn't believe "this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing." 

The baskets on the Big Board and CBOE -- which involve the actual S&P stocks, unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the Chicago futures markets, and index options on the CBOE -- will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market's wild price swings. 

The Big Board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more-volatile forms of program trading. 

ESPs are also an attempt by the Big Board to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as London.
Big Board officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange's product. 

Already, many of the Big Board's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public.
The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product, with the $5 million minimum, will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to "wild spasms of volatility." 

Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board's new product confirms the exchange doesn't want to curtail program trading, which last month accounted for a record 13.8% of the exchange's average daily volume. 

"The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here," said James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
The new stock baskets "are going to make it easier for program trading to be done.
And it's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places." 

Both the Big Board's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago exchange's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors.
The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans, mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders.
In index arbitrage, program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets. 

At the same time, only four securities firms have signed up with the Big Board to buy and sell ESPs as market makers, an unenthusiastic response.
The market makers so far are CS First Boston Group's First Boston Corp. unit, Morgan Stanley & Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Inc. 's Salomon Brothers Inc. unit. 

Kidder, Peabody & Co., a General Electric Co. unit that has become the biggest program trader along with Morgan Stanley, isn't a market maker, although the Big Board hopes that will change.
Similarly, the Big Board hopes to entice Merrill Lynch & Co. Neither has plans to be a market maker for now. 

Traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading.
Big Board officials say only 25 contracts a day may trade at first, equivalent to a day's action at a small, regional exchange. 

Even though the Big Board says its product represents a post-crash "reform," some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month's Friday the 13th market plunge, the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have dropped more than the 190 points it did. 

With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult, program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system, the traders say. "If we had the baskets, we would be leaving in caskets," one trader said. 

The SEC's Mr. Breeden said the after-hours trading on the Midwest exchange would help the U.S. win back business that has moved overseas to conduct after-hours trades. 

Kemper Financial Services Inc., charging that program trading is ruining the stock market, cut off four big Wall Street firms from doing any of its stock-trading business. 

The move is the biggest salvo yet in the renewed outcry against program trading, with Kemper putting its money -- the millions of dollars in commissions it generates each year -- where its mouth is. 

The Kemper Corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices, such as on Tuesday and on Oct. 13 and 16, and has increased chances for market crashes.
Over the past nine months, several firms, including discount broker Charles Schwab & Co. and Sears, Roebuck & Co. 's Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. unit, have attacked program trading as a major market evil. 

Several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months after the 1987 crash.
But most of them, led by Morgan Stanley & Co., moved back in earlier this year.
The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire, computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options.
The object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves. 

Index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Last month, program trading accounted for 20.9 million shares a day, or a record 13.8% of the Big Board's average daily volume. 

On Tuesday afternoon, Kemper told Bear, Stearns & Co., General Electric Co. 's Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit, Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage, officials inside and outside these firms confirmed.
Kemper officials declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a long-simmering dispute with four securities firms and said the list of brokers it won't do business with may be lengthened in the months ahead. 

"We've been opposed to" index arbitrage "for a long time," said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer at Kemper, which manages $56 billion, including $8 billion of stocks. "Index arbitrage doesn't work, and it scares natural buyers" of stock. 

While Mr. Timbers explained he's "not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market," he said that "on an intraday basis, it has major effects.
We've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they're ruining the market.
They said, `Too bad, ' so we finally said we're not going to do business with them." 

Kemper also blasted the Big Board for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders. "The New York Stock Exchange has vested interests" in its big member securities firms "that cloud its objectivity," Mr. Timbers said. "It has never been interested in what we think.
The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors," he added. 

Small investors perceive that "big operators" dominate the market, said Thomas O'Hara, chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange's Individual Investors Advisory Committee set up after the 1987 crash. "The impression I've got is they'd love to do away with it {program trading}, but they {the exchange} can't do it," he said. 

Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading.
He said the market's volatility disturbs him, but that all the exchange can do is "slow down the process" by using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers. 

Mr. Timbers countered that "the mere fact they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems." 

Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody, the two biggest program trading firms, staunchly defend their strategies. "We continue to believe the position we've taken is reasonable," a Morgan Stanley official said. "We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress, and we have recently," he said, citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week.
Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive officer at Kidder Peabody, said in a recent interview, "We don't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole." 

According to Lawrence Eckenfelder, a securities industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., "Kemper is the first firm to make a major statement with program trading." He added that "having just one firm do this isn't going to mean a hill of beans.
But if this prompts others to consider the same thing, then it may become much more important." 

A round of futures-related program selling near the close sent the stock market lower in otherwise directionless trading. 

Nervousness that the market hasn't seen the last of its recent volatility kept trading at a moderate pace, as did anticipation of a report on the economy's third-quarter performance. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which plunged more than 80 points in early trading Tuesday and then recovered nearly all of its losses by the close, fell 5.94 to 2653.28 in the latest session. 

The average drifted in a trading range of about 30 points throughout the day.
The lower boundary was established just after the opening in a brief round of selling; the upper boundary was set at midday as scattered bargain-hunting pushed prices higher. 

Buying interest in Du Pont, which declared a stock split and a dividend boost, and certain other blue-chip issues gave the industrial average a better performance than broader indexes. 

Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 1.20 to 342.50; the decline was the equivalent of a nine-point setback in the 30-stock average.
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 1.16 to 320.94 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slid 0.53 to 189.52. 

But advancing issues topped decliners by 784 to 700 on the Big Board despite the late sell programs, resulting from stock-index arbitrage.
The programs occurred against the backdrop of a late pullback in UAL, which had held at slightly lower levels through most of the session amid optimism that another bidder might surface. 

Traders said program activity wasn't in evidence through most of the session, however, and Big Board volume dropped to 155,650,000 shares from about 238 million Tuesday as concerns about the potential for additional sharp swings in the market kept other trading in check. 

"People are sort of nervous to do anything in the market now.
Our phones are quiet around here," said Don R. Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher & Singer Inc., Richmond, Va. 

The gross national product report, due to be released before today's opening, is expected to show that the economy continued to expand in the third quarter at a moderate pace.
The consensus of economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report calls for a 2.5% annual growth rate for GNP during the quarter. 

Du Pont, which announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend by 14%, jumped 2 1/2 to 117 3/8.
The company also posted third-quarter earnings that were in line with analysts' forecasts. 

Blue-chip consumer stocks also provided a lift to the industrial average. 

American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3/8 to 43 1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 1.5 million shares, Chevron advanced 1 3/4 to 66 5/8 on 2.3 million shares, Woolworth rose 1 to 58 5/8, Coca-Cola Co. gained 5/8 to 72 1/2 and Eastman Kodak added 3/8 to 44 1/2. 

But General Motors dropped 1 7/8 to 44 7/8.
Its GM Hughes Electronics and financial-services units both reported that third-quarter earnings were down from a year earlier. 

Anheuser-Busch plunged 4 3/8 to 38 1/2 on 3.5 million shares.
Its third-quarter earnings were lower than analysts had forecast, and the company said it had lowered its projections for earnings growth through the end of 1990 because of planned price cuts. 

Xerox fell 3 1/8 to 59 5/8.
Disappointment with the company's earnings for the quarter led Prudential-Bache Securities to reduce its 1989 and 1990 earnings estimates, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. 

Computer Associates International, the most active Big Board issue, was another victim of an earnings-related sell-off.
The stock fell 3/4 to 12 7/8 as 3.6 million shares were traded in the wake of its report that fiscal second-quarter net income fell 66% from a year ago. 

Insurance stocks moved higher in the wake of a strong third-quarter earnings report from Chubb, coming on the heels of speculation that last week's devastating earthquake in the San Francisco area would lead to higher premium rates. 

Chubb, whose net income for the quarter exceeded most analysts' expectations, rallied 3 3/4 to 86 1/2.
Aetna Life & Casualty gained 1 3/8 to 61 1/8, Cigna advanced 7/8 to 64 3/4, Travelers added 1/2 to 40 3/8 and American International Group rose 3 1/8 to 107 3/4. 

Comprehensive Care plunged 4 3/4 to 3 5/8 on 1.2 million shares.
The company reported a third-quarter loss and said it is holding talks with its bank lenders for an extension on some overdue debt payments. 

TW Services dropped 1 1/4 to 31 1/4 following the postponement of a $1.4 billion junk-bond offering that would have permitted Coniston Partners to complete its takeover of the company.
Coniston said it would pursue "various financing alternatives." 

UAL stock declined by 9 to 161 after nobody surfaced to claim credit for aggressive buying Tuesday by Bear Stearns that sent UAL stock up 35 points in a matter of hours.
Tuesday's rumored buyer, Coniston Partners, wouldn't comment on speculation that Coniston, which battled the UAL board in 1987, might challenge the board's decision Monday to remain independent. 

Other airline stocks were mixed.
AMR, which owns American Airlines, rose 3 3/8 to 72 1/4; USAir Group fell 1 1/2 to 38 5/8, and Delta Air Lines rose 1/2 to 66 1/2 after posting higher earnings for the September quarter. 

Stocks that reportedly benefited Tuesday from a Japanese buy program handled by PaineWebber gave back some of their gains.
Procter & Gamble went down 3 1/2 to 130, Dow Jones fell 3 1/2 to 37 1/2 and Rockwell International dropped 2 1/8 to 25.
However, Atlantic Richfield preserved its twopoint advance in the previous session and added 1/8 to 103 7/8. 

General Mills gained 2 1/4 to 72 7/8.
Goldman Sachs placed the stock back on its list of recommended issues, raised its 1990 earnings estimate and recommended that its clients shift funds from Kellogg to General Mills.
Kellogg dropped 1 3/4 to 73 1/4. 

Manville advanced 3/4 to 10.
The company offered to purchase $500 million of convertible preferred stock from the trust that handles its payments to asbestos victims. 

Di Giorgio gained 1 to 30 3/4 after the company said it is starting negotiations with unidentified parties interested in acquiring its units.
Investor Arthur Goldberg is pursuing a $32-a-share takeover offer. 

Esselte Business Systems rose 1 to 43 1/2.
Esselte AB of Sweden offered $43.50 a share for the 22% of the company it doesn't already own. 

Public Service of New Hampshire went up 3/8 to 4.
Northeast Utilities boosted its offer to acquire the company by $400 million, to $2.25 billion. 

Newell, which declared a 2-for-1 stock split and boosted its quarterly dividend by 14%, added 7/8 to 49 3/8.
Also, the company posted improved third-quarter earnings. 

The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.44 to 375.92.
Volume totaled 8,930,000 shares. 

Mission Resource Partners lost 5 1/4 to 14 1/8.
The partnership, which had solicited takeover offers, said it failed to receive any adequate bids for all of its operations but is reviewing offers for individual properties. 

Levi Strauss Associates Inc., the closely held owner of Levi Strauss & Co., said its fiscal third-quarter earnings jumped to $128.6 million from $31.3 million a year earlier, aided by a $69.8 million gain from the sale of stock in a Japanese subsidiary. 

The apparel holding company had sales in the quarter ended Aug. 27 of $1 billion, up 12% from $908.8 million a year ago. 

The company said its quarterly results are now being publicly filed as the result of the formation earlier this year of employee stock investment plans. 

Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors, chairman, assumed the additional responsibilities of president, succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors. 

Jeffrey Coors, 44 years old, had been president since 1985, when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job.
But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co., a small unit of Coors he has run for several years. 

A Coors spokesman said the company doesn't believe the move will further increase William Coors's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors, Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr., who run the company's three operating units. 

"It certainly wasn't intended to be a demotion," the spokesman said. "Pete and Jeff and Joe Jr. have taken over the reins and are doing most of the work.
We don't think this will affect that." 

Jeffrey, Peter and Joseph Jr. are brothers.
William Coors is their uncle.
Jeffrey, Peter, Joseph Jr., William and Joseph Sr. constitute the company's board. 

Peter Coors runs the Coors Brewing Co. unit, the nation's fourth-largest brewery that accounted for $1.24 billion of Adolph Coors's $1.52 billion in 1988 sales.
Joseph Jr. runs Coors Ceramics Co., the other operating unit, which had about $150 million in 1988 sales. 

American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data, video and voice communications. 

Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now, AT&T said, and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991.
The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $1 billion a year in sales by 1995, said Morgan Buchner Jr., vice president of transmission systems for AT&T. 

The products already available are cross-connect systems, used instead of mazes of wiring to interconnect other telecommunications equipment.
This cuts down greatly on labor, Mr. Buchner said.
To be introduced later are a multiplexer, which will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line; a light-wave system, which carries voice channels; and a network controller, which directs data flow through cross-connect systems. 

AT&T said the products, unlike previous generations, will meet so-called Sonet compatability standards, which AT&T expects to be broadly adopted.
Sonet, or synchronous optical network, products have more capacity than earlier models. 

"These products are the heart of our transmission-product line," Mr. Buchner said.
He declined to disclose specific prices, but said each product costs in the tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of dollars. 

AT&T said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals, Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and France's Alcatel N.V., which also have announced Sonet-based products. 

AT&T predicted strong growth in demand for such products.
It noted that last July, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. of Japan selected AT&T to supply $154 million of such equipment over a four-year period starting next year.

Amdahl Corp., a maker of mainframe computers, reported a sharp decline in net income for its third quarter, citing pricecutting by competitors and adverse effects from a strong U.S. dollar. 

Net income fell 37% to $32.9 million, or 30 cents a share, from $52.2 million, or 48 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
Revenue rose 15% to $534.3 million from $464.7 million. 

Amdahl's results were somewhat worse than expected.
Jay Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said he expected the Sunnyvale, Calif., company to earn 35 cents a share for the quarter and said the firm's weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from International Business Machines Corp., Amdahl's principal competitor for mainframe sales. 

A major Tokyo newspaper reported that a Japanese department store concern is planning to offer about $1.3 billion to buy Bloomingdale's.
Campeau Corp., the chain's owner, declined to comment on the report. 

A spokeswoman said Toronto-based Campeau has received "expressions of interest" in Bloomingdale's, but she declined to comment on whether any actual bids had been made.
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper, reported Wednesday that Tokyu Department Store Co. is planning to team up with U.S. and Western European financing to buy the New York-based retail chain, which Campeau has put up for sale.
The service didn't identify its Tokyu sources. 

"This is the first of many rumors we expect to hear during the sale's process," said a Bloomingdale's spokesman. "We won't comment on them." 

Tokyu executives weren't available for comment early Thursday morning in Tokyo. 

Campeau's chairman, Robert Campeau, said at its annual meeting in July that he valued Bloomingdale's at $2 billion.
Among previously disclosed possible bidders is Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin Traub, who has aligned himself with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Blackstone Group. 

Investment bankers in Tokyo confirmed that Tokyu Department Store is one of several Japanese companies that has been approached by representatives of a management committee headed by Bloomingdale's Mr. Traub.
But they said detailed financial figures haven't been passed yet to any prospective buyers. 

"Nobody is going to make a real bid before the middle of November," said one investment banker familiar with the discussions in Japan. "Tokyu is one of the potential buyers who might raise its hand.
But it's in very early stages still." 

Bloomingdale's is a 17-store chain acquired last year by Campeau in its $6.6 billion acquisition of Federated.
Bloomingdale's does an estimated $1.2 billion in annual sales. 

The sale of Bloomingdale's is a condition of efforts by Toronto-based Olympia & York Developments Ltd. to arrange $800 million in bridge financing for Campeau, which disclosed last month that its retailing units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., were strapped for cash.
O&Y, owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of Campeau, a Toronto-based real estate and retailing company. 

One executive familiar with the Bloomingdale's situation said, "No book has been issued regarding Bloomingdale's, there are no projections, so I doubt very much whether any bid has been made." 

Separately, a Campeau shareholder filed suit, charging Campeau, Chairman Robert Campeau and other officers with violating securities law. 

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeks class-action status.
The suit accuses the retailer and several of its officers of making false and misleading statements about the company's business affairs.
The suit says the company failed to disclose material adverse information about its financial condition. 

A spokesman for the company said Campeau hasn't seen the suit and declined to comment. 

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., buoyed by improved operating profit in its tire segment, reported that third-quarter net income rose 11% to $70.5 million, or $1.22 a share. 

In the year-ago period, Goodyear had net of $63.5 million, or $1.11 a share. 

Sales rose slightly to $2.68 billion, from $2.66 billion. 

Analysts had mixed responses to the results.
Donald DeScenza, an independent analyst in New Canaan, Conn., said he was "impressed with the company's performance." He said results were better than he'd expected and indicate that Goodyear is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year. 

However, Harry Millis, an analyst at McDonald & Co., Cleveland, said Goodyear's results "fell at the bottom" of his range of estimates.
Excluding an increase in the tax rate and the effects of foreign currency translations, Mr. Millis said the company's results "were still a little disappointing." 

Goodyear's stock, which has been weak in recent weeks, fell $2.875 yesterday to close at $43.875 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

The Akron, Ohio-based company said pretax operating income in its tire segment jumped about 31% to $196.2 million from $150.2 million a year earlier, reflecting improvements in raw material costs, sales of replacement tires and pricing. 

McDonald's Mr. Millis said Goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the U.S. for the first time since the second quarter of 1988. 

But Goodyear said total U.S. tire unit sales were off about 2%.
Total tire segment sales were up only about 1% to $2.2 billion, and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its U.S. tire plants because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers. 

In the latest quarter, Goodyear's tax rate was 51% compared with 41% a year earlier.
As a result, total tax outlays were $73.5 million, compared with $44.1 million the year earlier. 

For the nine months, profit skidded about 35%, reflecting charges taken in this year's second quarter and the effect of translations of weaker foreign currencies into the stronger U.S. dollar. 

Net was $192.1 million, or $3.33 a share, compared with net of $293.7 million, or $5.13 a share, the year earlier. 

The latest nine months included charges of $95 million related to the company's South African subsidiary and unused pipe sold by its crude oil pipeline unit. 

Sales rose nearly 2% to $8.13 billion from $7.98 billion. 

International Business Machines Corp. said it agreed to let Motorola Inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry. 

IBM, which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here, said it invited many other companies to participate as well, including some from Europe.
Jack Kuehler, IBM's president, said IBM is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific. 

IBM, which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work, has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally U.S. industry to head off the Japanese, who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips. 

While IBM, Armonk, N.Y., makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses, it doesn't make the equipment needed to produce those chips.
And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market, too, unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy.
Failure of U.S. equipment makers, IBM fears, would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market. 

IBM also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that Motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing.
IBM already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques. 

IBM said it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive.
A state-of-the-art plant cost $40 million in the mid-1970s but costs $500 million today because the technology is so complex.
And IBM said it expects the costs to continue climbing. 

IBM, which said Motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21-month agreement, acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in.
But it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s.
IBM said it thought more companies would become interested as the project progresses. 

The project involving Motorola concerns a technique, called X-ray lithography, that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips. 

Currently, chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip, much as a camera produces an image on film.
But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine, and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one.
X-rays, by contrast, travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light. 

X-rays have problems, too.
They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material they're not supposed to.
But, assuming those problems can be overcome, they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as much as is contained in the four-megabit chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s. 

GORBACHEV SAID Moscow won't intervene in East bloc moves to democracy. 

The Kremlin leader, on the first day of a three-day official visit to Helsinki, assured Finland's president that the Soviet Union has "no moral or political right" to interfere with moves toward democracy in Poland, Hungary or elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
In Moscow, the Soviet State Bank announced a 90% devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions, in an apparent attempt to curb a black market for hard currency.
The action will establish a two-tier exchange rate.

The move defied a law, approved in Moscow this month, banning such walkouts. 

THE HOUSE FAILED to override Bush's veto of a bill easing abortion funding. 

The chamber voted 231-191, 51 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the president's veto of legislation renewing support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest.
The roll call was considered an illustration of the limits of power that the resurgent abortion-rights movement faces.
The legislation was part of a $156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor, Education, and Health. 

Michigan's Senate passed a bill requiring girls to get parental consent for an abortion and Pennsylvania's House cleared a measure banning abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy. 

The FDA is expected to approve today a program granting access free of charge to the drug AZT for children with AIDS. Adults have had access to the only approved antiviral drug since 1987.

Sotheby's Holdings Inc., the parent of the auction house Sotheby's, said its net loss for the seasonally slow third quarter narrowed from a year earlier on a leap in operating revenue. 

The New York-based company reported a third-quarter net loss of $5.1 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $6.2 million, or 12 cents a share.
Operating revenue surged 54% in the latest period to $42.9 million from $27.7 million. 

The company said 80% of its auction business is usually conducted in the second and fourth quarters, with the current quarter having begun "extremely well." 

Place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are the clerk who answers won't be the only one on the line.
Bosses have big ears these days. 

Or open up an electronics magazine and peruse the ads for sneaky tape recorders and other snooping gadgets.
Some would make even James Bond green with envy. 

Eavesdropping -- both corporate and private -- is on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies.
And while sellers of the equipment and companies "monitoring" employees have few qualms, right-to-privacy advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed. 

"New technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work," says Janlori Goldman, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. "Our expectation of confidentiality is being eroded." 

On the corporate side, companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service.
The practice is common at catalog, insurance and phone companies, banks and telemarketers, according to trade groups and worker organizations.
It's also widespread for reservations clerks in the airline, car-rental, hotel and railroad industries. 

The Communications Workers of America, which opposes such monitoring, says supervisors listen in on an estimated 400 million calls each year.
Among companies saying they monitor employees are United Airlines, American Airlines, United Parcel Service, Nynex Corp., Spiegel Inc., and the circulation department of this newspaper.
Some Wall Street firms monitor for recordkeeping purposes. 

Dictaphone Corp. says there's a big business demand for its voice-activated taping systems, whether the sophisticated Veritrac 9000 system, which costs from $10,000 to $120,000 and can record 240 conversations simultaneously, or simple handheld units selling for $395. 

Businesses "want to verify information and ensure accuracy," says John Hiltunen, Dictaphone's manager of media relations.
The state of Alaska recently bought the Veritrac system, he says, "to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort." 

Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. say they use voice-activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders.
Shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks, such as commodities and futures, for about four years.
Both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations aren't taped. 

Kidder Peabody & Co. says it monitors bond-trading conversations between brokers and customers to safeguard order accuracy. 

Eavesdropping by individuals is harder to measure.
But devices are there for the asking, whether in stores or through the mail.
The Counter Spy Shop in Washington, D.C., for instance, offers the "Secret Connection" attache case, which can surreptitiously record conversations for nine hours at a stretch.
That and other fancy gizmos may cost thousands, but simple voice-activated tape recorders sell for as little as $70 at electronics stores like Radio Shack. 

The most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases, say private investigators.
While tape recordings to uncover, say, infidelity aren't admissible in court, they can mean leverage in a settlement. 

Concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it, lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue.
Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring.
And four states -- California, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded. 

Two bills in Congress hope to make such restrictions national.
In May, Rep. Don Edwards (D.
Calif.) introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring, warning people that they are being heard. (The legislation is similar to a 1987 "beeper bill" that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry.) Also last spring, Rep. Ron Dellums (D., Calif.), introduced a bill requiring universal two-party consent to any tapings in cases that don't involve law enforcement.
In addition, products such as voice-activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping. 

The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain, especially remembering the 1987 defeat.
The ACLU and worker organizations back tighter laws, but employers and device manufacturers object. 

"I'm sympathetic with workers who feel under the gun," says Richard Barton of the Direct Marketing Association of America, which is lobbying strenuously against the Edwards beeper bill. "But the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening." The powerful group, which represents many of the nation's telemarketers, was instrumental in derailing the 1987 bill. 

Spiegel also opposes the beeper bill, saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders, causing irritation and even errors.
Laura Dale, center manager at the catalog company's customer order center in Reno, Nev., defends monitoring. "We like to follow up and make sure operators are achieving our standards of company service," says Ms. Dale, who supervises 350 operators. 

John Bonomo, a Nynex spokesman, says the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job. "Sometimes," he says, "we'll pull someone off the phones for more training." 

Federal wiretap statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees' for evaluation purposes.
And in the past, Congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations.
But opponents, led by the CWA, say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81% of monitored workers aren't represented by unions.
The CWA claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy, but increases stress. 

"Nine to Five," a Cleveland-based office workers organization that supports the beeper bill, six months ago started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses. 

Meanwhile, supporters of the Dellums two-party consent bill say it is needed because of a giant loophole in the one-party consent law.
Currently, if the person taping is a party to the conversation, it's all right to record without the knowledge of the other person on the line. (Intercepting other people's private conversations is illegal and punishable by five years in prison and fines of $10,000.) 

The electronics industry is closely following the Dellums bill.
Some marketers of surveillance gear -- including Communication Control System Ltd., which owns the Counter Spy Shop and others like it -- already put warning labels in their catalogs informing customers of the one-party law.
But vendors contend that they can't control how their products are used. 

Radio Shack says it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally. "Everything sold at Radio Shack has a legal purpose," says Bernard Appel, president of the Tandy Corp. subsidiary.
He says he hasn't yet studied the Dellums bill, but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders "would be ludicrous." 

Still, Radio Shack is aware that some of its products are controversial.
A few years ago, the company voluntarily stopped selling "The Big Ear," a powerful microphone.
With its ability to pick up rustlings and flapping wings, "it was meant to be a toy for children for bird watching," says Mr. Appel. "But we were getting too many complaints that people were using them to eavesdrop on their neighbors." 

Maxicare Health Plans Inc., operating under Chapter 11 bankrupty-law protection, outlined terms of its reorganization plan that calls for creditors and shareholders to receive at least $78.8 million in cash and $67 million face amount of 10-year, 13.5% notes. 

The plan, outlined in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, also calls for creditors and shareholders to receive common stock and warrants in the new company.
The health-maintenance concern said it reached the agreement with its court-appointed creditors' committees Sept. 28, and intends to submit the plan to the bankruptcy court in November. 

Maxicare, which filed for bankruptcy protection March 16, has total debt of $750 million.
The company has promptly paid all its expenses and obligations since March 16, a Maxicare spokesman said. 

General unsecured creditors of Maxicare's continuing operations initially will receive $47 million in cash, $35 million face amount of senior notes, and 49% of the new company's stock.
Those creditors, whose claims are estimated at about $200 million, include doctors and hospitals. 

General unsecured creditors of Maxicare's discontinued operations, whose claims total $110 million, initially will receive $17.8 million in cash and $10 million in senior notes.
Maxicare's public shareholders will receive 2% of the new company's stock and warrants entitling them to acquire as much as an additional 5% of the stock on a fully-diluted basis. 

General unsecured creditors of the parent holding company initially will receive $14 million in cash, $22 million face amount of senior notes and 49% of the new company's stock.
That group includes banks and bondholders, who have claims of $150 million and $350 million respectively.
Maxicare also will guarantee that the banks will realize at least $7 million on certain notes pledged to them. 

Maxicare said the plan stipulates that enrollees in the company's health plans will have valid claims covered in full.
Those claims, along with priority employee claims, administrative claims, priority tax claims and administrative convenience claims, are expected to total about $16 million. 

The plan is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court and others.
The spokesman said Maxicare hopes to complete the reorganization by early 1990. 

Philip L. Hall, president of J. Lawrence Hall Co., Nashua, was named a director of this thrift holding company, filling a vacancy. 

The average interest rate rose to 8.337% at Citicorp's $50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs, from 8.292% at last week's sale. 

Bids totaling $475 million were submitted.
Accepted bids ranged from 8.328% to 8.347%. 

However, Citicorp said that the average rate fell to 7.962% at its $50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 7.986% at last week's sale. 

Bids totaling $425 million were submitted.
Accepted bids were all at 7.962%. 

The bank holding company will auction another $50 million in each maturity next Tuesday. 

Comprehensive Care Corp., which has agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp., reported a $4.7 million loss for its Aug. 31 first quarter and said it is negotiating an extension of senior bank debt past its Oct. 18 due date. 

In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Comprehensive Care shares plunged $3.625 to close at $4.75 on volume of 1,177,000 shares. 

The loss in Comprehensive Care's latest quarter is equal to 46 cents a share.
In the year-earlier quarter, Comprehensive Care earned $1.6 million, or 18 cents a share.
Revenue in the latest quarter fell 17% to $44 million from $53.2 million, the company said, reflecting poor utilization of the company's facilities and its behavioral medicine contracts. 

Comprehensive Care shareholders have approved acquisition of the developer and operator of Care-Unit chemical dependency and psychiatric programs for about $58 million in cash, notes and stock of First Hospital, Norfolk, Va.
The price was reduced last August from an indicated value of $76 million. 

Comprehensive Care said First Hospital had advised it that both bank debt and senior notes would be repaid after the acquisition, although it isn't assured the acquisition will be completed.
If it isn't completed, Comprehensive Care said it would be "required to promptly restructure its debt." 

First Hospital advised Comprehensive Care that an agent for the financial institutions providing financing of its acquisition is scheduled to make a final credit determination tomorrow, and that a favorable determination could result in a reorganization at Comprehensive Care "by the end of October." Failure to win such a determination, however, would lead Comprehensive Care directors to "consider various alternatives," Comprehensive Care said, without elaborating. 

Separately, First Hospital reported a 1.6% rise in net income to $6.1 million for its year ended June 30 on a 27% increase in revenue to $110.6 million.
It said, however, that net income for the two-month period ended Aug. 31 plunged to $150,000 from $851,000 in the prior year on a 33% rise in revenue to $21.4 million. 

Bob Evans Inc. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as 500,000 shares of its common. 

The stock, to be purchased on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, will be held as treasury shares for stock options or other general corporate purposes.
The program expires April 27.
The restaurant operator had 32.2 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 29. 

Advanced Medical Technologies Inc. said it purchased 93% of a unit of Henley Group Inc. 

Advanced Medical paid $106 million in cash for its share in a unit of Henley's Fisher Scientific subsidiary.
The unit makes intravenous pumps used by hospitals and had more than $110 million in sales last year, according to Advanced Medical. 

Maggie Thatcher must be doing something right; her political enemies are screaming louder than ever. 

Mrs. Thatcher, who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics years before Mr. Bush encountered it, has made clear her opposition to refashioning Britain's free-market policies to suit the bureaucrats in Brussels.
In return, Mrs. Thatcher is excoriated from Fleet Street to Paris as an obstructionist. 

Well, it now turns out that Mrs. Thatcher had to travel across the globe to the 49-member Commonwealth summit in Kuala Lumpur to discomfit the Holy Order of Consensus Builders. 

"A disastrous farce in Malaysia," screamed the Manchester Guardian. "She can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad." Egad.
Canada's Brian Mulroney and Australia's Bob Hawke, the paper said, were "enraged." The London Times said she had "contravened protocol." 

As usual, her sin was saying what she thought.
She issued a separate statement, separating herself from a Commonwealth document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against South Africa.
While supporting the Commonwealth "in utterly condemning apartheid," her statement urged it to "encourage change" rather than inflict further punishment on the country's black population. 

Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions: In May a Gallup Poll found that most South African blacks, 85%, oppose economic sanctions.
Still, Mrs. Thatcher had once again gone against the grain.
Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sniffed, "If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot, you are out of step." Mrs. Thatcher: "If it's one against 48, I'm very sorry for the 48." 

If indeed Mrs. Thatcher has one opponent that could throw her off political course it is Britain's mysteriously intractable inflation problem.
We cannot, however, join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that Mrs. Thatcher refuses to get along by going along.
It is refreshing to see at least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs. 

Perhaps Mrs. Thatcher understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and Britain's voters will decide who is right about Europe, sanctioning South Africa or running Britain's economy. 

ONEIDA Ltd. declared a 10% stock dividend, payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov. 17.
The Oneida, N.Y., maker of consumer, food-service and industrial products also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents a share, with the same payable and record dates.
The cash dividend paid on the common stock also will apply to the new shares, the company said.
The move rewards shareholders and should improve the stock's liquidity, Oneida said.
The company has about 8.8 million shares outstanding.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Oneida's shares closed at $18.375 a share, unchanged. 

Columbia Savings & Loan Association, reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by Congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market, announced a loss for the third quarter of $226.3 million, or $11.57 a share. 

For the quarter a year ago, Columbia reported earnings of $16.3 million, or 37 cents a share.
Total assets increased to $12.7 billion in the latest quarter from $12.4 billion a year earlier. 

The loss stems from $357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia's $4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio, which includes about $3.7 billion of junk bonds, $400 million of preferred stock, and Treasury securities. 

Columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio, the largest of any U.S. thrift.
Much of Columbia's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 

For the nine months, losses totaled $212 million, or $10.83 a share, compared with net income of $48.7 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. 

The results include a $130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value. 

Columbia also added $227.3 million to reserves for losses on the portfolio, increasing general reserves to $300 million, or about 6.7% of the total portfolio, as of Sept. 30.
On June 30, loss reserves stood at $108.3 million.
Thrift officials said the $300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions. 

The adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout legislation, which requires thrifts to divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994.
Previously, Columbia didn't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices, because it held the bonds as long-term investments.
Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years, accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices. 

For its future strategy, Columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments, as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities. 

The quarterly results also reflected $21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California. 

Thomas Spiegel, Columbia's chairman, said in a statement that the thrift was "disappointed" by the effects of the accounting changes.
But he said Columbia remains "one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry," based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital. 

Columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market.
Its shares closed at $5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, down 37.5 cents.
The price of Columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since August, when they traded at about $10, as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down.
The stock's decline accelerated in the past two weeks, from a price of $8 a share on Oct. 9. 

Columbia officials said they don't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift's junk bonds, because federal regulations, such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries, haven't yet been completed. 

Columbia officials also said the thrift shouldn't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements, despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year's end.
Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of Sept. 30 was 3.6%, and total equity was $457.9 million. 

The thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs, which has a book value of $90 million. 

Although many of the transactions related to those securities haven't been completed, Columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $200 million to $300 million.
Columbia also has unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $70 million.

Bethlehem Steel Corp., hammered by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and service-center customers, posted a 54% drop in third-quarter profit. 

Separately, two more of the nation's top steelmakers -- Armco Inc. and National Intergroup Inc. -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses, marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry. 

Wall Street analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of 1990, when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines, such as rolled sheet used for cars, appliances and construction. 

"It doesn't bode well for coming quarters," said John Jacobson, who follows the steel industry for AUS Consultants.
In fact, he thinks several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of 1990. 

Bethlehem, the nation's second largest steelmaker, earned $46.9 million, or 54 cents a share.
The figures include $15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and $8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company's coal operations.
In the year-ago period, Bethlehem earned $101.4 million, or $1.27 a share, including a $3.8 million gain from early retirement of debt. 

Third-quarter sales dropped 11% to $1.27 billion from $1.43 billion a year ago. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Bethlehem shares rose 50 cents to $17.375. 

Of all the major steelmakers, Bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown.
It hasn't diversified beyond steel, nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks. 

However, in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume, Bethlehem "had pretty good earnings numbers," said Michelle Galanter Applebaum, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. Ms. Applebaum had estimated third-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share, but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected. 

Still, Bethlehem's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $58.6 million from $186.4 million a year ago, when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing.
The company said its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers, a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market. 

At the same time, production costs, compared with a year ago, were boosted by higher raw material and employment costs, which resulted from the company's new labor pact effective June 1. 

"We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories," said Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams.
He noted, however, that the company's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer, following the end of labor negotiations. 

Armco, hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business, said third-quarter net income dropped 8% to $33 million, or 35 cents a share, from $36 million, or 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.
Sales dropped to $441.1 million from $820.4 million, because the company no longer consolidates its Eastern Steel division, which is now a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp. 

Along with reduced volume, analysts said the nation's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped.
Operating profit dropped 46% in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment.
Moreover, the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its Armco Steel Co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market, higher production costs and a poorer product mix. 

Armco shares closed unchanged at $10.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

National Intergroup, which owns 50% of the nation's sixth largest steelmaker -- National Steel Corp. -- posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $8.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $50.3 million.
Sales increased in the quarter ended Sept. 30 to $747.8 million from $623.5 million a year ago.
The latest period includes gains of $9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward.
Last year's results were hurt by $41.3 million in restructuring charges. 

National Intergroup stock closed at $15, unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co., Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves.
However, its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $6.3 million from $10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike.
National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50% interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations. 

This is in response to Atsushi Kageyama's Manager's Journal, "Looking for the Real Thing in Sony" (editorial page, Oct. 2).
Though I agree with many of Mr. Kageyama's comments, I believe he points the gun in the wrong direction: It isn't the Americans who must be criticized for not understanding the Japanese culture, but the Japanese who insist on forcing their culture on Americans.
The Japanese want us to accept their culture, but they refuse to accept the American culture.
Japanese managers can't expect Americans to behave as if they were Japanese; instead, they must manage Americans as Americans. 

Americans are expected to conform to the Japanese culture when in Japan.
What is wrong with expecting the Japanese to conform to American norms when they locate here?
Americans place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas.
European multinationals do likewise; even in America, their affiliates are usually run by American managers.
But the Japanese insist upon Japanese managers everywhere they set up shop.
Do the Japanese feel so superior that they cannot find capable American managers?

Mr. Kageyama suggests that Kotobuki Electronics Industries workers were having difficulty understanding their foreign bosses' perspective.
While Mr. Kageyama does an excellent job of explaining the differences, both cultural and philosophic, I question his perspective. 

Would he suggest that employees of an American company doing business in Japan conform to their new bosses' culture and philosophy?
Obviously not.
Thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand/adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating.
The workers can be motivated, and the company reach its full potential, only when management embraces the employees' perspective.

I believe Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece: the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others. 

A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management.
Instead, he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates.
Japanese culture vs.
American culture is irrelevant.
The key is how a manager from one culture can motivate employees from another. 

For Mr. Kageyama to argue that American employees must passively accept a direct imposition of the Japanese way of doing things is outright cultural chauvinism of the first order.
The Japanese are neglecting the opportunity to synthesize a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national cultures. 

Mr. Kageyama is accurate to deny a specific anti-American bias.
It is more difficult to deny a general bigotry in seeing things only the Japanese way.
When the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without altering the reasons for the criticism, I am convinced that Mr. Kageyama has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms.

Former USX Corp. Chairman David M. Roderick may have been lucky he retired last May. 

As he handed over the reins to successor Charles A. Corry, steel profits were close to a cyclical peak.
Though imports were troublesome, they weren't running away with the market, and American companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would be extended for another five years.
Perhaps most important, Carl Icahn, who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid, was subdued.
He and Mr. Roderick were even dining out together. 

Today, Mr. Corry presides over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly.
Mr. Icahn, the company's deep-pocketed, tenacious adversary, recently disclosed that he had raised his USX stake to 13.1%, and he again threatened a takeover.
A battle with Mr. Icahn would rattle even the most seasoned chief executive, to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago. 

In addition, USX's giant steel segment, representing 34% of its 1988 sales, is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills.
The import quotas got only a 2 1/2-year extension, and USX is laboring under a staggering $5.8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil. "It's a baptism of fire for Corry," says one USX executive. 

The burning question is whether the new chief can parry Mr. Icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves.
Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to.
Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn's stock, possibly at a premium, or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of Mr. Icahn's pressure. 

With his recent purchases of USX common stock, Mr. Icahn shattered a three-year-old, unwritten standstill agreement with Mr. Roderick.
In 1986, Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4% stake.
Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes, a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a $7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $3 billion.
And he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper.
Over dinners at New York's Sky Club and Links Club restaurants, the steel executive and the big investor talked steel, international trade and thoroughbred horses. 

Mr. Corry, who has boned up on corporate raiders by reading T. Boone Pickens's autobiography, had hoped the detente would continue.
He was shocked, associates say, to learn of Mr. Icahn's new takeover threat. (Both men declined to be interviewed for this article.) But the fiercely competitive Mr. Corry quickly showed he's no pushover.
He huddled with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent. 

Although the board believed that Mr. Icahn is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring USX, it adopted a poison-pill defense, to be swallowed if anyone amasses a 15% stake. 

Now, it's Mr. Icahn's move.
Will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of USX into separate oil and steel companies?
Given the weakness of the junk-bond market, can he finance a buy-out?
Mr. Icahn may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in Texaco Inc. in June -- a coup that gave him enough cash to make his USX move. 

And although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets, by making it harder to arrange takeover financing, has eased some of the pressure on Mr. Corry, it doesn't end the takeover threat. "I know it's not over," a sober-faced Mr. Corry acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in New York on Oct. 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of Kobe Steel Ltd., USX's partner in a steel mill in Lorain, Ohio. 

In fact, it's barely begun for Mr. Corry, who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job. "He's in a vulnerable position because he hasn't established much credibility on his own," says Bryan Jacoboski, a securities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. 

The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive.
An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs, Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company "that could do big things." But after joining the tax department of a USX subsidiary 30 years ago, he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46.
For years, he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms, wearing a hat to work because everyone else did. "I was never a rebel," he said in an earlier interview. "I don't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they've seen me pound the table or get angry." 

Yet, the unassuming Mr. Corry helped chart USX's transition from Big Steel to Big Oil.
He served as Mr. Roderick's front man in tense negotiations for the 1982 purchase of Marathon Oil for $5.9 billion. 

Nevertheless, Mr. Corry, once named chief executive, didn't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss, who still has an office on the 62nd floor of the USX tower in Pittsburgh.
Soon after taking over last June, Mr. Corry rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers, a move that Mr. Roderick hadn't made in spite of improved earnings.
Mr. Corry also ruled that all board meetings would be held in Pittsburgh instead of New York or Findlay, Ohio, Marathon's home. 

And, earlier this month, he announced the sale of the reserves of Texas Oil & Gas, which was acquired three years ago and hasn't posted any significant operating profits since.
One former executive says, "Nobody wanted that deal inside USX except Dave Roderick," who was a hunting and fishing buddy of William L. Hutchison, chairman of Texas Oil & Gas.
The executive recalls Mr. Corry whispering to him and others, "Remember, this was Dave's deal." 

What miffed many USX executives and shareholders was that the acquisition, for $3 billion of stock, doubled the USX shares outstanding and considerably diluted them.
What's more, the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as Texas Oil & Gas reported its first annual loss in 28 years. 

Mr. Corry expected the Texas Oil & Gas sale to delight Mr. Icahn by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value.
But when the two men met in New York a day after Mr. Icahn disclosed the rise in his USX stake, Mr. Corry learned that Mr. Icahn wanted him to sell all of Texas Oil -- not just its reserves of about 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 28 million barrels of oil but also its pipeline, gas-gathering and contract-drilling operations.
That would leave USX with Marathon, its steel mills and its diversified business segment, which includes, among other things, mineral and transportation products. 

Some speculate that Mr. Corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price.
The problem is that Mr. Icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring USX than Mr. Corry had planned.
Mr. Icahn has long believed, associates say, that the company, whose 1988 sales totaled $16.88 billion, is worth $70 a share if broken up.
The stock closed yesterday at $33.625, giving Mr. Icahn's 33.6 million shares a value of $1.13 billion. 

Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company's steel operations, and Mr. Corry doesn't necessarily disagree.
Unlike his predecessor, who saw steel as America's backbone, Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential, associates say.
In the past five years, USX has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs.
But the short-term outlook is so-so. 

It isn't surprising that Messrs.
Roderick and Corry view steel so differently.
While Mr. Roderick was reared in the shadows of Pittsburgh's smoking mills, Mr. Corry grew up in Cincinnati, a city nicknamed "Porkapolis" and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron.
He has never met Lynn Williams, the president of the United Steelworkers union, and isn't active in the industry's main trade group, the American Iron and Steel Institute, which Mr. Roderick served as chairman. 

"Dave thought the country needed a strong U.S. Steel and, while Chuck agreed, he was more apt to say, `Not at any cost to shareholders, '" a former executive says.
Indeed, Mr. Corry, at an August press conference, talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and "not a day longer." 

However, shedding steel would run directly counter to Mr. Roderick's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas: Having two major products would lessen the company's vulnerability to one market's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings.
As Mr. Roderick once said: "We're a two-product company and, boy, if you can't figure out the value of those two parts, you are so damn dumb that you don't belong on Wall Street." 

Moreover, the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to USX may be gone, for now. "The time has passed for us to spin off steel," either in a public offering or to a buyer, one executive contends.
About the only way that USX now can get out of steel is to dish it out, piece by piece, in separate joint ventures, he adds. 

With Mr. Icahn breathing down his neck, however, Mr. Corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price, even if it means losing some steel-related tax-loss carryforwards.
That would leave USX essentially an oil company with Marathon as its core.
Marathon has benefited from higher crude-oil prices and strong demand for refined products. 

Oil has long been Mr. Corry's pet.
Indeed, when the Bush administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions -- arguably the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years -- Mr. Corry and his directors were aboard helicopters, high above Marathon's rich oil reserves in the North Sea. 

Should USX be left with only Marathon, Mr. Corry might well feel pushed to scout out other energy companies.
However, even USX executives who work closely with him aren't sure about his long-term goals. "I don't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go," one says.
Right now, the executive adds, "he wants to continue to focus on paying down" USX's debt by selling assets. 

One thing is certain, however: Mr. Corry, while studying other options, probably won't make a major move until he's clear about Mr. Icahn's intentions.
And then, "he won't panic," says J. Bruce Johnston, a former USX executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with Adler Cohen & Grigsby in Pittsburgh. 

Mr. Corry learned presence under fire when, as vice president of corporate planning, he handled what Mr. Johnston calls "don't-con-me" negotiations that led to USX's shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction. 

When negotiating, Mr. Corry played his cards close to the vest.
Johnnie Johnson, who worked for Mr. Corry in strategic planning, recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates. "What he really wanted to know was about a particular company, but you didn't know that.
He wanted your own unbiased, virgin opinion," says Mr. Johnson, now managing director at Georgeson & Co., a proxy-solicitation and investor-relations firm. 

Ever the pragmatist, Mr. Corry said in August that he realized that USX is on "acquisition screens all over the country." 

"It's part of the capitalistic market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought," he said.
USX, he noted, was formed 88 years ago, "by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies. . . . People got rich through takeovers in those days, as they do today."

Anheuser-Busch Cos. said it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands, setting the stage for a potentially bruising price war as the maturing industry's growth continues to slow. 

Anheuser, the world's largest brewer and U.S. market leader, has historically been reluctant to engage in price-cutting as a means of boosting sales volume.
With the passing of the heady days of swelling industry sales, however, the once-sporadic and brief forays into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry. 

Over the summer, Anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time.
Some experts now predict Anheuser's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players. 

The St. Louis company said major rivals, Philip Morris Co. 's Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. "have been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for at least the past 18 months" on their premium brands, pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser's Budweiser label in many markets.
Anheuser said it's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a market-by-market basis. 

Anheuser-Busch announced its plan at the same time it reported third-quarter net income rose a lower-than-anticipated 5.2% to $238.3 million, or 83 cents a share, from $226.5 million, or 78 cents.
Third-period sales were $2.49 billion, up from last year's $2.34 billion. 

Anheuser said its new strategy -- started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide -- will mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for the last half of 1989 and for 1990.
The projection sent Anheuser shares plunging $4.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
The stock closed at $38.50 on heavy volume of about 3.5 million shares.
Shares of Coors, the company's sole publicly traded major competitor, fell $1.50 apiece to $19.125 in national over-the-counter trading, apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle. 

Anheuser noted that "beer industry sales volume is 1989 is following the trend that has characterized the last half of the '80s, with sales volume being essentially flat" while consolidation creates fewer, bigger players. 

"We cannot permit a further slowing in our volume trend," Anheuser said, adding it will take "appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy" for the premium brands.
Anheuser said it continues to hold to its earlier-announced goal of a 50% U.S. market share by the mid-1990s. 

Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant, which last year accounted for about 41% of all U.S. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to 42.5% in the current year. "Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar, and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl," said Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "It's going to get bloody." 

Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketers Insights, a trade newsletter, said Anheuser's announcement means "everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives." 

Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst George E. Thompson downplayed the importance of the announcement, and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending "cola wars," unwarranted.
Mr. Thompson calls discounting "a loser's game for anyone without a dominant market share," and projected that Anheuser's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle. 

Mr. Thompson noted that the disappointing earnings, which fell five cents a share short of his own projections, contributed to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public. 

But Smith Barney's Mr. Doyle, who yesterday trimmed his 1990 Anheuser earnings projection to $2.95 a share from $3.10, called the market's reaction "justified." While the third-quarter earnings were a "moderate disappointment," he said, "the real bad news is the intensity of price competition" in the premium-beer sector. 

According to Mr. Steinman, the newsletter publisher, Anheuser's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor, Miller Brewing, which had a 21.2% stake last year.
It's followed by Stroh Brewery Co., which has agreed to sell its assets to Coors.
Both Coors and Stroh have recently been ceding market share to Miller and Anheuser. 

The Democratic-controlled House, by a margin of 51 votes, failed to override President Bush's veto of legislation renewing federal support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest. 

The 231-191 roll call illustrates the limits of power a resurgent abortion-rights movement still faces.
It continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over Mr. Bush. 

Democrats voted to override by a 3-1 margin, but Republicans were equally firm in support of the president, who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal 1990 spending bills. 

Yesterday's vote dealt with the largest of these bills, an estimated $156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services.
To gain more leverage, abortion-rights advocates may seek to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month.
But the stark numbers yesterday -- when 282 votes were needed -- indicate the president is in a commanding position for at least this year. "Unless he changes, they lose," said a Democratic leadership aide. 

The action came as Congress sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake.
By a lopsided 97-1 margin, the Senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential California delegation and, despite reservations, the House adopted the bill on a 303-107 roll call. 

The package is more than $1 billion above the recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week.
But given the political importance of California, the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations.
The $2.85 billion measure comes on top of $1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month, and these totals don't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans. 

The bill last night includes $500 million to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity.
In direct cash assistance, $1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters. 

In the Senate, Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months.
The emergency assistance wouldn't be counted against a state's normal allocation of annual highway funds, and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road, such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge damaged in last week's earthquake. 

The underlying stopgap bill is the second required by Congress this fall and, since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1, only the Energy and Interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law.
The standoff over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and, apart from the health and education measure vetoed by Mr. Bush, bills funding the District of Columbia and the entire U.S. foreign-aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family-planning issues. 

The vote yesterday was the most partisan in many years, and though the Democratic leadership is ambivalent about how to address the abortion issue, the debate is increasingly measured in party terms.
The 189 Democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who initially backed the rape-and-incest exemption two weeks ago and 136 last year on a similar vote. 

By comparison, Republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement.
Only 42 GOP members opposed the president's veto, a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who supported the rape-and-incest exemption last year. 

At a recent White House meeting, Rep. Silvio Conte (R., Mass.), the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee, argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto, and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday, they are plainly uncomfortable with his position. 

"This isn't a political issue, this is a moral issue," said Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement.
But after years of using the issue for its benefit, the GOP finds its candidates on the defensive.
New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Rep. James Florio pointedly returned from campaigning to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent, GOP Rep. James Courter, who has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent. 

In an extraordinary mix of cultures and church-state powers, Rep. Robert Dornan (R., Calif.) lectured his fellow Roman Catholics -- including Mr. Florio -- for having the "chutzpah" to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion.
Rep. Les AuCoin was as blunt on behalf of the abortion-rights movement. "This may not make George Bush a one-term president," said the Oregon liberal, addressing the Republican side of the House. "But if you support him over rape victims, this may be your last term." 

Separately, the House last night approved a nearly $67 billion compromise spending bill providing the first construction funds for the administration's ambitious space station in fiscal 1990 and incorporating far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market.
The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to $124,875, and the bill gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low-income homeowners. 

By a 325-92 margin, the Appropriations Committee leadership beat back an early challenge by House Banking Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) to the FHA provision.
And on a closer 250-170 roll call, lawmakers upheld controversial agreements made by a House-Senate conference earmarking community development funds for more than 40 projects backed by often influential members.

U.S. Memories Inc., the venture that seeks to crack Japan's domination of the memory-chip market, said it has chosen four potential sites for its operations after a fierce bidding war by 15 states. 

U.S. Memories said it will begin visits during the next several weeks to sites in Austin, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Middletown, N.Y.; and Phoenix, Ariz.
Sanford Kane, president, said the finalists were chosen from among 57 locations based on financial, business, and quality of life considerations. 

Conspicuous by its absence is California.
San Jose and several other California cities mounted major campaigns during the summer to woo the group, which was founded last June by seven electronics concerns. 

The venture plans to announce a final site by late November.
It expects to begin construction by year end and start shipping four-megabit dynamic random-access memory chips by mid-1991. 

U.S. Memories investors include Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp., Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp., and National Semiconductor Corp. Mr. Kane said he expects several other companies to join some time after the venture completes a business plan, probably later this week. 

Ryder System Inc. posted a third-quarter net loss of $27.6 million, because of an expected $57 million after-tax charge and continued weakness in the company's truck-rental business. 

The loss, which is 38 cents a share, is the transportation services concern's first quarterly setback in more than a decade and compares with net income of $55.3 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
The previous year's third quarter included gains on the sale of aircraft by the company's Aviation Leasing & Services Division.
Revenue was flat at $1.3 billion. 

The latest quarter's after-tax charge -- which is 75 cents a share -- was related to adjustments to reserves for workers' compensation claims; reductions in vehicle fleets, staff and facilities; and writedowns of assets.
Although Ryder didn't break out the charge, analysts estimated that the majority of the $57 million was linked to workers' compensation reserves and anticipated losses on the disposal of trucks. 

Many analysts said they weren't surprised that problems in many of Ryder's lines of business continued to plague the company. "It pretty much confirms what we had been expecting," said Anthony Hatch, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Ryder closed at $22.25, down 37.5 cents. 

M. Anthony Burns, Ryder's chairman and chief executive officer, said: "We're constantly trying to find ways to regain the earnings momentum.
But we're still at the beginning stages of some of these changes." He said the fourth quarter will be "challenging," and maintained his conservative forecast that 1990 "won't be a barn burner." 

In the nine months, net income fell 79% to $31.1 million, or 33 cents a share, from $149.3 million, or $1.82 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose slightly to $3.8 billion from $3.7 billion. 

After being trampled in Tuesday's selling stampede, the Nasdaq over-the-counter market dusted itself off and moved on in moderate trading. 

But while the Composite gained 1.19, to 462.89, many issues didn't participate in the advance. "It was a mixed bag," said Richard Bruno, who heads over-the-counter trading at PaineWebber. "We played catch-up in some areas, and sold off in some others." 

Volume totaled 132.1 million shares, which is about average for the year.
Of the 4,348 issues that changed hands, 1,074 advanced and 866 declined. 

Big financial stocks carried the day.
The Nasdaq Financial Index rose 2.09, to 454.86.
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 Index of the big non-financial stocks basically stood still, easing 0.12, to 452.23. 

Despite the Composite's advance, some trading officials are guardedly optimistic that the market is on the road to recovery.
Lance Zipper, head of over-the-counter trading at Kidder Peabody, said it is difficult to make predictions based on yesterday's trading volume.
The advance felt more like a technical bounce, he said. 

"The market acted better, but it wasn't a tremendous comeback," Mr. Zipper observed. "If we get a decent rally {today}, maybe the buyers will come back." 

If E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld is right, a seatbelt may come in handy during the next few sessions.

American Medical International Inc. said it hasn't received any other offers to acquire the owner and operator of hospitals, and took another step toward completion of its $3 billion acquisition by IMA Holdings Corp. 

Earlier this month IMA, an investment group that includes Chicago's Pritzker family and First Boston Corp., submitted a reduced bid for American Medical after it couldn't finance its initial offer.
Under the new offer, IMA will pay $26.50 a share for 63 million shares, or about 86% of the shares outstanding.
IMA also will assume $1.4 billion in debt. 

Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AMI common closed at $23.625, up 12.5 cents, on volume of almost 1.8 million. 

Earlier, American Medical said it had been approached again by two other possible suitors, whom it wouldn't identify but who had previously submitted bids for the company.
Yesterday, American Medical said that the two other parties told the company that they don't have any current intention of making a takeover bid. 

American Medical said its directors have approved what is, in effect, a draft of a solvency opinion on the acquisition, submitted by the Los Angeles-based investment banking and evaluation consulting firm of Houlian Lokey Howard & Zukin Inc.
A final opinion must be approved prior to the acceptance of tendered shares for payment under the offer, which was due to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT today. 

Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the ratings of American Medical's senior and subordinated debt issues and those of its international affiliate.
The downgrade anticipates completion of the IMA Holdings acquisition today, Moody's said. 

The ratings concern said the acquisition should result in pretax losses from operations because of increases in interest expense and charges for depreciation and amortization, but that it expects the losses to be reduced through productivity gains and above average growth of the company's hospitals.
Moody's said the ratings anticipate a successful debt-reduction program and modest improvement in discretionary cash flow because of planned asset sales. 

Moody's changes affected the following issues: American Medical International: Senior notes, sinking-fund debentures, Euromarket notes, Eurobonds, Swiss franc bonds, unsecured loan stock to Ba3 from Baa2; convertible subordinated debentures, notes, and sinking-fund debentures to B2 from Baa3. 

American Medical International N.V.: Guaranteed Euroissues to Ba3 from Baa2. 

An American Medical spokeswoman said the Moody's downgrading was expected because of the nature of the takeover. 

Christopher Cox's Oct. 13 editorial-page article "Toward More Crippling Lawsuits . . ." misses the point.
The 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act is about eliminating discriminatory barriers. 

When we look closely at our own history, it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments.
This is how American women won the right to vote.
And it is how African-Americans and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation. 

For the more than 43 million Americans with disabilities, the 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act provides the missing piece.
Disabled Americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed as a part of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.
The 1989 act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector.
Those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on the Rehabilitation Act.
Without legal recourse, there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone.

After coming close to a partial settlement a year ago, shareholders who filed civil suits against Ivan F. Boesky and the partnerships he once controlled again are approaching an accord, people familiar with the case said. 

Meanwhile, within the next few weeks, the limited partners in Ivan F. Boesky & Co. L.P. are expected to reach a partial settlement with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. regarding the distribution of the $330 million in partnership assets, said one of the individuals.
Under the terms of the settlement, the limited partners would drop their civil suits against Drexel, now pending in federal court in New York, another individual said. 

Attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they were a year ago, when reports of an imminent agreement circulated.
One individual said the shareholders' accord was "well worked out." 

However, less optimistic attorneys warned that because of the tangle of numerous defendants and plaintiffs with overlapping claims, there is always the possibility that the talks will again fall apart. 

A shareholders' accord would provide the first restitution to thousands of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by Boesky & Co., once the largest arbitrage fund in the U.S.
The plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which Mr. Boesky and his partnerships were dealing.
Some claim they suffered losses because they sold while he was buying and others because they bought while he was selling. 

Stocks involved in the shareholder suits include Union Carbide, RJR Nabisco, American Natural Resources, Boise Cascade Corp., General Foods Corp., Houston Natural Gas and FMC Corp. 

There are at least 27 class-action shareholder suits that have been consolidated in federal court in New York under U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack.
Among the defendants are Mr. Boesky; the now-defunct Ivan F. Boesky & Co.; Mr. Boesky's main underwriter, Drexel Burnham; and Cambrian & General Securities PLC, a British investment fund once controlled by Mr. Boesky. 

Individuals familiar with the negotiations said the partial settlement being negotiated would remove the Boesky partnership, the British fund and Mr. Boesky as defendants, while Drexel and other defendants would remain. 

Charles Davidow, of the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, which represents Mr. Boesky in this matter, said only that "discussions are under way.
There are no agreements yet." 

It has been three years since Mr. Boesky, now in prison, agreed to pay a $100 million fine to settle the government's charges that he had traded illegally using insider information.
Out of this, the government set up a $50 million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses.
According to William Orbe, an attorney at Grais & Richards, the escrow agents for the fund, as of Sept. 30 the fund amounted to $60.5 million. 

Separately, attorneys for the 42 or so limited partners have had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership's assets.
The limited partners include insurance companies, financial institutions and individual investors. 

An agreement with Drexel regarding the limited partners' investments is an essential step toward getting their money back.
This is because a Delaware court earlier this year said that Drexel is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited partners.
Drexel is owed $20 million by the partnership. 

An individual familiar with the negotiations said that whatever investments the limited partners do not recoup from the $330 million in partnership assets, they will receive from the $350 million restitution fund available as a result of Drexel's settlement with the government in December 1988. 

Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $650 million, of which $350 million was set aside for shareholders and other plaintiffs, including the limited partners, who claim they were injured by Drexel.

U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. ordered the FBI to immediately begin processing Herman Benjamin Ferguson's request for documents stemming from the agency's investigation of him during the 1960s.
The FBI had said it would not be able to begin processing the request until June 

Mr. Ferguson, who is 68 years old, fled the U.S. in 1970 after exhausting his appeals of a 1968 conviction on conspiracy to murder.
He turned himself in to authorities in New York earlier this year.
He maintains that the information from the FBI will help him get his 1968 conviction vacated and his bail-jumping indictment dismissed.
His attorneys claim he was framed by the FBI and New York police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s. 

Because the federal Freedom of Information Act wasn't law at that time, the FBI wasn't required to turn over information on its investigations when Mr. Ferguson appealed his conviction in the 1960s.
But in federal court in Manhattan, Judge Patterson said the FBI records could show that Mr. Ferguson's arrest was the result of questionable legal practices. 

The judge said that if the FBI's proposed schedule was followed in releasing the documents, "a delay of over one year will have occurred and plaintiff will have served approximately two-thirds of his 3 1/2-year minimum sentence by the time he receives the files." 

Gabriel W. Gorenstein, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case for the FBI, said no decision has been made about appealing the judge's ruling. 

FEDERAL COURTS URGED to cut costs and reduce delays of civil suits. 

The study, conducted by a task force of the Brookings Institution, suggests that Congress should require the courts to develop the plans.
The study was initiated by Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.). 

The Washington, D.C., think tank recommends that the courts adopt different "tracks" for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones.
Complex cases, such as antitrust suits and many business disputes, would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pretrial proceedings moving.
Standard cases would require less judicial attention, and fast-track cases could be resolved quickly. 

The study also said each federal court should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence, ranging from as much as 100 days for cases in the fast track to as much as 18 months for complex disputes.
And the study said federal courts should set firm trial dates early in the process. 

To take advantage of local expertise and custom, the study said, Congress should require each of the 94 federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases. 

Although some of the study's recommendations resemble those of similar projects, the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse, adding significance to the effort.
It included lawyers from civil rights and consumer groups, plaintiffs' lawyers and defense attorneys, corporate counsel and law professors. 

Tokyo stocks closed easier for the second consecutive day, finishing at the intraday low on index-linked investment trust fund selling toward the end of the afternoon session.
Stocks rose in London, but fell again in Frankfurt. 

Tokyo's Nikkei index fell 84.15 points to 35442.40.
Trading was active.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 1 billion shares, up from 914 million Tuesday.
The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 8.65 at 

In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 145.45 points to 35587.85. 

On Wednesday, the market opened bullishly with high turnover, ignoring the volatility in New York stocks.
But losers were spread in a broad range by the end of the session.
A trader said that the more an issue gained recently, the sharper the loss sustained Wednesday. 

A trader at Yamaichi Securities said the market's mood was undercut by the continuing fall of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone shares, which declined to their lowest level since the begining of this year.
NTT lost 30,000 yen to 1,380,000 yen ($9,756). 

Some traders noted individual investors dumped NTT shares amid growing expectation for a division of the company as suggested by a recent government-sponsored panel. 

Dealers said they also took profits to reduce holdings in their own account at the end of the October transaction period. 

Among pharmaceutical shares, Chugai lost 60 yen to 2,290 yen ($16.20), and Mochida fell 150 to 4,290. 

Other losing issues included Showa Shell, which fell 40 to 1,520.
Toyota Motor fell 40 to 2,680. 

Sekisui House, which gained 150 Tuesday, lost 70 to 2640.
Daiwa House also ended easier, but Misawa Home was firmer. 

Pioneer Electronic and Sony, both of which dominated buying earlier this month, continued to fall Wednesday.
Pioneer was down 90 at 5,810, and Sony lost 40 to 8,550, down 10% from its record set Oct. 11. 

London share prices closed modestly higher largely on technical factors, although the market was underpinned near the end of the session by Wall Street's firmer trend. 

The Financial Times 100-share index finished at 2161.9, up 12.6 points.
The 30-share index ended 12.6 points higher at 1751.9.
Volume was thin at 374.6 million shares traded, down from 405.4 million Tuesday. 

Dealers said the market gained some late steam on a flurry of buying by market-makers looking at blue-chip issues and stocks viewed as oversold during the market's recent downtrend. 

Outside what essentially amounted to a bookkeeping exercise, dealers said London dealings were largely dulled by the absence of active interest beyond the market-makers. 

The late buying was drawn into the London market, dealers added, after Wall Street showed signs of stability following its rocky opening. 

Stocks that suffered on the day were those with active U.S. operations, dealers noted.
Among them were B.A.T Industries, which settled 6 pence a share lower at 753 ($12.10).
Hanson, with 15 million shares traded, closed 2.5 lower at 212.5. 

Dealers said the shares were hit by fears of a slowdown in the U.S. economy. 

Cable & Wireless benefited from a market squeeze, bouncing 13 to 498 in moderately active volume. 

Jaguar was boosted 21 to 715 on follow-through buying after Ford Motor's announcement Tuesday that it might be prepared to mount a full bid for the U.K. luxury auto maker.
It was further helped by Ford, which announced after London's close that it had raised its stake to 12% from just under 11% on Tuesday. 

Frankfurt prices closed sharply lower in thin dealings, hurt by the roller-coaster session on Wall Street Tuesday and worries about wage demands by the largest West German trade union.
The German stock index tumbled 26.29 to end at 

"It was dead, listless, depressing and negative," said one trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt. "There was little turnover and nothing to stimulate the market." 

Equities tumbled at the opening as Tuesday's gyrations on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered most of an 80-point loss, fueled fears of another stock market crash, brokers said. 

Tough talk from trade union officials at the conference of the powerful IG Metall metals worker union in West Berlin raised the specter of nationwide strikes next spring, they said.
For the 1990 wage negotiations, the IG Metall is demanding a further cut in the German workweek and steep wage increases, which could sharply increase the costs for German industry. 

"All the positive figures on the economy are out already, and people are focusing more on the dangers for next year, mostly the wage talks and the {parliamentary} elections," the U.S. trader said.
The market also shrugged off positive factors, such as higher bond prices and a slowdown in monetary growth in September, traders said. 

They said they expect the bearish mood to persist a while longer, as trading volume is falling toward the end of the year and the market is becoming more volatile. 

In the auto sector, Bayerische Motoren Werke plunged 14.5 marks to 529 marks ($288), Daimler-Benz dropped 10.5 to 700, and Volkswagen slumped 9 to 435.5. 

Continental gave up some of its recent gains, dropping 8 to 338, as rumors of an impending takeover attempt for the tiremaker faded, brokers said. 

Deutsche Bank plummeted 12 to 645, hurt by the general mood.
Other banks were slightly more resilient, with Dresdner Bank shedding 4.8 to 320, and Commerzbank slipping 2.5 to 

Meanwhile, Wall Street's volatility unnerved investors in other markets.

Genentech Inc. said third-quarter profit more than doubled to $11.4 million, or 13 cents a share, from a depressed 1988 third-quarter performance of $5.3 million, or six cents a share. 

Revenue rose 23% to $100 million from $81.6 million.
Net product sales accounted for $76 million, up from $57.5 million a year earlier. 

Sales of the heart drug TPA were $43.6 million, better than last year's depressed third period when the company sold just $29.1 million of the drug.
But TPA sales fell below levels for this year's first and second quarter sales of $48 million, cooling investors.
Genentech stock fell 12.5 cents in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange to $20.125. 

In the nine months, net income slid 21% to $28.4 million, or 33 cents a share, from $36 million, or 42 cents a share.
Revenues climbed 18% to $289 million from $245.3 million. 

"We continue to be on target for . . . increasing TPA sales 20% to 25% this year," said founder and Chief Executive Officer Robert Swanson.
But some analysts remain sour on the company. 

"TPA sales are down quarter to quarter.
Expenses are flat and that's a good sign.
There's contract revenue from {limited research and development} partnerships.
But I still think the fundamentals are poor," said Denise Gilbert, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 

Genentech faces competition in the cardiac-drug market from SmithKline Beecham PLC's heart drug Eminase, expected to receive market approval shortly.
And Genentech isn't likely to have any new products ready for market until at least 1992, Ms. Gilbert added. "The company's stock is trading at 40 times next year's numbers, and that's too much," she said. 

On the plus side, Genentech is benefiting from a lower tax rate due to its research outlays, giving a boost to earnings, she said. 

Comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan lent some support to the dollar, but the U.S. unit ended yesterday lower against most major currencies. 

Foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street. 

Traders said that Mr. Greenspan, whose statements are ordinarily cautious, was especially careful to avoid any jarring proclamations, with fears about equities still unnerving financial markets. 

Testifying before a panel of the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets isn't the primary policy focus of the central bank. 

"Our essential focus is on domestic policy," Mr. Greenspan said, referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy. 

In perhaps his most telling remark, Mr. Greenspan termed the current U.S. inflation rate of around 4.5% as "much too high to be ignored." 

He added, however, that inflation could be brought down "close to zero" without throwing the economy into a recession. 

Analysts viewed the chairman's comments as an indication that the central bank is disinclined to ease monetary policy further in the near future. 

The dollar climbed immediately higher on news of Mr. Greenspan's testimony, settling lower in later trade as dealers squared positions ahead of today's preliminary report on third-quarter U.S. gross national product. 

In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8353 marks, down from 1.8355 marks Tuesday, and at 141.52 yen, up from 141.45 yen late Tuesday.
Sterling was quoted at $1.6145, up from $1.6055 late Tuesday. 

In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.60 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 141.55 yen. 

Many traders forecast a continuation of the market's recent bearish trend and predict the U.S. currency will remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower. 

But according to Doug Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles, a large number of short positions must first be corrected, spurring a temporary upswing, before the unit can turn lower. 

He predicts a downward move in dollar-mark trade and a less dramatic slip in dollar-yen, noting that there continues to be a large pool of Japanese investor interest in U.S. securities, which could provide a solid base for the dollar at around 140 yen. 

Market participants hope today's GNP report will offer more substantial evidence on U.S. economic growth, although analysts are quick to point out that the figures may overstate the economy's vigor. 

"The `r' word is looming again," says one dealer, referring to persistent concern among some market analysts that the U.S. economy is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession. 

Some dealers note that while the third-quarter figures may appear relatively bullish -- the market consensus calls for a 2.5% annual growth rate, unchanged from the second-quarter rate -- it would take a significantly stronger figure to alter market perceptions that the economy is softening. 

Some analysts reckon that the next quarter's figures will present a more accurate picture of the U.S. economy, showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors, including housing starts and equities.

As a presidential candidate in 1980, George Bush forthrightly expressed his position on abortion in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine published that March.
What did he think of the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion? 

"I happen to think it was right," Mr. Bush said flatly. 

A few months later, Mr. Bush became Ronald Reagan's running mate.
Suddenly, George Bush the pro-choice advocate became George Bush the anti-abortionist.
And the vacillation didn't end there. 

Just a month ago, Mr. Bush sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds, except to save a woman's life.
Then, two weeks ago -- declaring that "I'm not looking for any conflict over this" -- the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest. 

But only four days after that, Mr. Bush resurrected the veto threat. "I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother's life is threatened," he proclaimed, and finally vetoed the measure last weekend. 

So what does George Bush really believe?
The answer is so murky that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal, increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue.
The result is mistrust and criticism from all around. 

Anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally. "In all honesty if you ask me, `Is this man a true believer? ' I don't know," says John Fowler, head of the Washington-based Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc. Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical.
Douglas Gould, vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, calls Mr. Bush's position on the abortion-funding issue "extremely cruel," adding: "The guy hasn't done one thing about prevention.
He's totally geared to a punitive position." 

Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question.
For most of the past nine years, he has striven to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position.
But ever since the Supreme Court's Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue, the president seemingly has tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall. 

Many Americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion.
Mr. Bush's problem isn't so much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it.
The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it, experts insist. "If you have a position, you're better off to stick with it than to move around very much," says Republican strategist John Sears.
The need for consistency is especially acute for Mr. Bush, who, Mr. Sears maintains, lacks a strong ideological base. 

By his moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters, the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments.
Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House.
On many issues -- flag-burning, for instance -- his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts. 

But Mr. Bush and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue, failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would be aroused following last summer's Supreme Court decision to restrict those rights in the Webster case. 

"It was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes I've ever seen," says former Reagan pollster Richard Wirthlin. 

These days, when others raise the subject of abortion, the usually loquacious president can be close-mouthed almost to the point of curtness.
Ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance. "My position is well-known and well-stated," he replied. 

A close look at his record over the last 15 years suggests that Mr. Bush has well-stated his views -- on all sides of the issue. 

In 1974, as the U.S. representative to the United Nations, he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in Congress in expanding family-planning services for the poor.
Running for president in early 1980, he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. 

In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980, Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival, Ronald Reagan.
In addition to supporting the landmark Roe vs.
Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, Mr. Bush said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that Mr. Reagan was promising to promote. 

As Mr. Reagan's running mate, though, Mr. Bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position, endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.
He acknowledged only one difference with Mr. Reagan -- that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman's life. 

Throughout the early 1980s, Mr. Bush was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it.
In April 1986, then-Vice President Bush had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment, but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case.
At the GOP convention last year, he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape, incest and life endangerment. 

His rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office, affirming his "firm support of our cause" during an anti-abortion rally three days after his inauguration last January.
He again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion. 

But when the high court ruled in the Webster case in July, the president began to lower the volume.
When the ruling was handed down, the vacationing president dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself.
He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the District of Columbia's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund.
But in the months since then, while trying to drum up support for other issues -- such as an anti-flag-burning constitutional amendment -- he has shied away from talking about abortion.
What few comments he has initiated have been oblique, such as urging "greater efforts toward the protection of human life" at a meeting of Catholic lawyers in Boston last month. 

The White House has likewise avoided any involvement in Florida's recent special legislative session on abortion, which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions.
The session failed to enact any new curbs. 

Now, some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape.
Ken Ruberg, head of the Republican Mainstream Committee, a group of party moderates, observes: "The administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of." 

Birmingham Steel Corp. said that its Emeryville, Calif., minimill sustained only minor damage from last week's earthquake. 

Steelmaking resumed Oct. 18, but the company expects production to be hampered in the next few months by traffic disruptions around the plant and outages for repair to gas and electric power systems. 

Businessland Inc. said it purchased a major regional computer retailer, Data Systems Computer Centre Inc., Springfield, New Jersey.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

The purchase strengthens San Jose, Calif.-based Businessland's links to the large corporations who are among the biggest buyers of computers.
Data Systems has five retail stores in the northeast, but specializes in selling personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. to banks, brokerage firms and other big businesses based in the New York metropolitan area. 

John Fitzsimmons, chief executive officer of Data Systems, said the company was profitable and expected sales of nearly $100 million this year.
He said Businessland, which operates stores in 50 U.S. metropolitan areas, planned to absorb his firm's operations. 

A group including New York investors Douglas A. Kass and Anthony Pedone holds the equivalent of a 12.6% stake in H.H. Robertson Co. 's common shares outstanding, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Officials of Pittsburgh-based H.H. Robertson, which makes steel roofs, store fronts and building parts, declined comment.
As reported last month, Mr. Kass said he was interested in making an offer to buy H.H. Robertson for $13 a share. 

In the SEC filing, the Kass-Pedone group said it intends to acquire additional H.H. Robertson shares "with a view towards a possible change in control of the company." It has not, however, made a formal proposal. 

The group also is engaged in talks with third parties regarding obtaining financing to buy more shares, but no agreements have yet been reached, the filing said. 

The group controls 795,900 H.H. Robertson common shares, assuming exercise of an option it acquired from Executive Life Insurance Co. to buy 497,400 shares.
Its stake includes 106,100 shares bought in the open market from Aug. 30 to Oct. 18 for $10.375 to $12.125 a share. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, H.H. Robertson closed at $11.625, up 62.5 cents. 

House and Senate conferees agreed to continue production of Grumman Corp. 's F-14 and to provide more than $3.8 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative during the current fiscal year. 

Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill, hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over the past few days, provide a face-saving compromise for both the White House and House Democrats.
Although conferees are still putting the finishing touches on the package, the final agreement could be announced as early as tomorrow.
An announcement is more likely next week, though. 

President Bush and other supporters of SDI will be able to take credit for blocking House efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space-based antimissile system, which already has cost some $17 billion.
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) and other Senate conferees have opposed the House cuts, stalling for almost two months action on a number of big-ticket items in the Pentagon's budget. 

The Senate voted to authorize $4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year, but the House, reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program, earmarked only $3.1 billion.
Despite the widening gap between the two sides, conferees eventually followed the pattern set in previous years by opting to roughly split the difference.
That would hold spending on the program at about the previous year's level. 

The decision to keep the embattled F-14's production line running for at least another year is an important victory for the House, and especially for Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.).
As the head of the House conferees, Rep. Aspin has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject Senate provisions that would have abruptly cut further F-14 production. 

The package "provides a temporary, golden parachute for Grumman," according to one congressional aide familiar with the closed-door bargaining.
But as part of the overall agreement, Grumman and its outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill effectively will be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate over next year's budget. 

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and most senators contend that the Navy's F-14 is too expensive in an era of shrinking Pentagon budgets.
But the plane boasts a strong core of support in the House, where members are intent on saving Grumman jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier-based aircraft by the late 1990s. 

Conferees also agreed to Pentagon requests to earmark a total of nearly $1 billion for work on both mobile MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, according to congressional aides. 

And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that would give the Air Force nearly all of the $2.4 billion it wants for production of Northrop Corp. 's radar-eluding B-2 bombers, which cost $530 million apiece.
The final B-2 agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber's capabilities, but congressional aides said the accord won't include a House-passed provision that would have withheld production funds until Congress approves a cheaper, scaled-down version of the $70 billion fleet of 132 B-2s envisioned by the Pentagon. 

Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Association said it plans to restructure in the wake of a third-quarter loss of $7.7 million, or $1.01 a share, reflecting an $11 million addition to loan-loss reserves. 

The Portland, Ore., thrift said the restructuring should help it meet new capital standards from the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act.
A year ago, Benjamin Franklin had profit of $1.8 million, or 23 cents a share. 

In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Benjamin Franklin rose 25 cents to $4.25. 

The company said the restructuring's initial phase will feature a gradual reduction in assets and staff positions.
The plan may include selling branches, consolidating or eliminating departments, and winding down or disposing of unprofitable units within 18 months. 

Initially, the company said it will close its commercial real-estate lending division, and stop originating new leases at its commercial lease subsidiary. 

Details of the restructuring won't be made final until regulators approve the regulations mandated by the new federal act, the company said. 

Federal health officials are expected today to approve a program granting long-deferred access to the drug AZT for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 

Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services.
The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of AIDS to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease. 

The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status, a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval.
The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection. 

Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the drug's usage for adults in March 1987.
But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children, the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients.
As a result, many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and, for the few exceptions, insurance carriers won't cover its cost of $6,400 a year. 

So far, AIDS has stricken 1,859 children under age 13, with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms.
To date, 1,013 of those children have died, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. 

Mothers of young AIDS patients expressed somber satisfaction. 

"Thank goodness it's happening.
It should have happened sooner," said Elizabeth Glaser, a Los Angeles mother and activist who contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion, and transmitted it to two of her children.
One of them, a daughter Ariel, died a year ago at age seven after her parents unsuccessfully pleaded for the drug. 

"I could get AZT," says Mrs. Glaser, who bears her infection without any symptoms. "But my daughter couldn't, until she was too ill to take it.
To watch your child die is an inhuman experience." Her son, healthy and symptom-free, currently takes no medication. 

The delay in getting AZT to children has been blamed on a combination of factors.
Traditionally, the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses, because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape.
Secondly, critics have charged AZT's maker Burroughs Wellcome Co. with corporate inertia because children account for just 1% of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market. 

Wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead to compile the relevant data, and recently promised to develop a pediatric syrup form easier for youngsters to take. 

Still, all this comes nearly a year and a half after Philip Pizzo of the National Cancer Institute offered evidence that AZT could reverse the ravages of AIDS dementia, sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills.
Since then, roughly 50 pediatric patients have received the drug in his program. 

To some mothers, the expected FDA action is a poignant reminder of what might have been. 

"My first reaction is I don't understand why it's taken so long.
Why has it taken people so long for people to understand pediatric AIDS is a major problem?" asked Helen Kushnick, whose son Samuel died six years ago at age three, victim of a tainted transfusion. 

Similar sentiments were voiced on Capitol Hill. 

"While I'm pleased the FDA is finally releasing AZT for children, it's taken much too long to get to this point," said Rep. Ted Weiss. "Why did it take Burroughs Wellcome so long to apply" for treatment investigational new drug status? the New York Democrat asked. 

"Let's not forget this is the same company that has been profiteering with this drug for 2 1/2 years," Mr. Weiss added. 

Mrs. Glaser, who is a co-founder of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, based in Santa Monica, Calif., condemned neither bureaucratic nor corporate foot-dragging. 

"There's no finger to be pointed," she said. "The crucial thing is that we learn our lesson well, and to make sure other experimental drugs, like Bristol-Myers Co. 's DDI, don't follow the same frustrating course as AZT." 

AIDS dementia -- which gradually steals children's ability to speak, walk and think -- is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome.
For some patients, AZT has restored the ability to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles, giving back a piece of their childhood if only temporarily. 

"It's impossible to overstate how much this means to the families of these patients," said Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute and a main developer of AZT. 

The hottest rivalry in the computer industry intensified sharply yesterday as Digital Equipment Corp. announced its first line of mainframe computers, targeting International Business Machines Corp. 's largest market. 

IBM fired back with new mainframes of its own, extending the long-dominant 3090 line with a 7% to 14% power boost. 

Up to now, the intense competition between IBM and Digital has been confined largely to the broad midrange of the computer market, where Digital sought to exploit IBM's weaknesses in networking.
But Digital's move into mainframes will target IBM's home turf, where it has a commanding 70% share of the market. 

Digital, Maynard, Mass., insisted yesterday that its marketing focus would differ sharply from IBM's. "This is not your father's mainframe," said Allan McGuire, a Digital spokesman. "It's a whole new generation," he said. 

IBM, which gets about half its revenue and more than half its profit from mainframes, also announced upgraded operating system software that, together with the new hardware, lets customers do so-called batch processing as much as 60% faster.
Batch processing is the high-volume, single-job data processing that most mainframes typically chug through at night, such as updating accounts at banks. 

IBM said the 16 new J and JH models will generally be available immediately, though three won't ship until the third quarter of next year.
Prices on the larger models, which range as high as $13 million, generally won't change.
Small models, whose performance increased as much as 46%, will carry higher prices.
Upgrades to bigger models also will be costlier. 

Digital's VAX 9000 mainframes, which it claimed were among the fastest available, were priced from $1.2 million to $3.9 million, sharply lower than IBM models of comparable power.
The first models will ship in the spring, with the largest following in the fall.
Analysts were disappointed that Digital's new line apparently won't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year, which begins in July.
Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least some mainframe profit this year.
But he added that he expected to raise his estimate for fiscal 1991 at the same time. 

After the announcement yesterday, Digital shares gained $1.25 to close at $89.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
IBM shares closed at $103, down 50 cents, in Big Board trading. 

Analysts have predicted strong pent-up demand for the new line among Digital's customers.
Large Digital buyers say the new VAX will let them stay with Digital when they need the power of a mainframe, instead of turning to IBM. "I'm convinced there's a huge market for this machine," said Stephen Smith of PaineWebber Inc. 

Digital also plans to compete fiercely with IBM when the giant's customers are computerizing new aspects of their businesses.
Digital, however, doesn't expect to displace IBM mainframes that are already installed at big companies. 

In addition to commercial markets, Digital's new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market, when it's packaged with an optional supercharger, known as a vector processor. 

Digital's push into mainframes comes at a time when its mainstay minicomputer line is under growing pressure from smaller personal computers and workstations that operate on standard operating systems rather than on the proprietary systems that older minicomputers use.
Although Digital has staked out a major presence in the booming workstation market, profit margins in that market are much slimmer than for mainframes. 

The slow-growing mainframe market also has shown new signs of life lately.
IBM's mainframe sales have held up better than expected this year, with analysts estimating they have risen 10% to 12%. 

"Demand for these systems has been very, very strong," said Bill Grabe, a senior IBM marketing executive. "We have a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without" the systems that were announced yesterday. 

But the 3090 line is nearly five years old -- which is getting up there in mainframe years -- and its growth is expected to slow in 1990. 

IBM, Armonk, N.Y., said it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year.
The fourth quarter is always IBM's biggest by far, with most sales coming in December as customers seek to use budgets before year end. 

Still, Steve Cohen, an analyst at SoundView Financial Group Inc., said, "I don't see that this will be sufficient to give IBM a significant kick in the fourth quarter." 

IBM has already indicated it will have problems in the quarter, partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of IBM's overseas earnings when translated into dollars.
Some analysts have estimated IBM's fourth-quarter per-share earnings will fall 10% to $3.57 a share from $3.97 a share a year earlier. 

In addition to the new mainframe hardware and software, IBM announced a magnetic-tape system for data storage that it said occupies half as much floor space as older systems but can store five times as much data on a single cartridge.
That should help IBM address the damage that a resurgent Storage Technology Corp. has inflicted in that market. 

Philip Morris Cos., New York, adopted a defense measure designed to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. 

The giant foods, tobacco and brewing company said it will issue common-share purchase rights to shareholders of record Nov. 8.
Under certain circumstances, the rights would entitle Philip Morris holders to buy shares of either the company or its acquirer for half price. 

The board isn't aware of any attempts to take over Philip Morris, the company said.
As of Sept. 30, Philip Morris had 926 million shares outstanding.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Philip Morris shares closed yesterday at $43.50 each, down $1.

At a time when Jon Levy should be planning the biggest spring season in his dress company's 17 years, his work day is studded with intense moments of concern about one of his biggest customers, Campeau Corp. 

"The dress business has always been a gamble, but it's never been like this," says Mr. Levy, president of St. Gillian Group Ltd., which has become a hot name thanks to a campaign of sexy TV commercials. 

Every day, Mr. Levy checks orders from Campeau department store chains, trying to guess if he will be paid. "I'm now monitoring every major account." 

Campeau, owner of such retailers as Bloomingdale's, Bon Marche, and Jordan Marsh, sidestepped financial collapse last month after an emergency $250 million loan from Olympia & York Developments Ltd., a Canadian developer and a major shareholder in Campeau.
The need for the loan surprised many analysts and bond holders who had been told at the company's annual meeting in July that there weren't any major problems ahead. 

The risk of doing business with Campeau's Federated and Allied department store chains is about to increase greatly, not only for Mr. Levy but for hundreds of other small apparel makers, button suppliers, trucking firms and fabric houses. 

Next week, the country's top designers and manufacturers will begin showing fashions for spring 1990, the second most important selling season of the year.
And as the applause dies down in showrooms along Seventh Avenue and Broadway, stylishly clad Campeau buyers will begin writing orders. 

Orders from Campeau retailers used to be cause for celebration.
This is no longer true because of Campeau's massive debt load. 

"It's all anybody wants to talk about," says Richard Posner, executive vice president for Credit Exchange Inc., a leading credit service. "People wonder what's going to happen next." 

Many manufacturers are worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to Campeau stores.
But those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship spring goods to Campeau stores. 

"The few million dollars I could lose today is nothing against what I could lose on the spring line," says Mr. Levy, who estimates that Campeau stores will sell $25 million worth of his clothes this year. "I'm buying fabric right now for clothes which I may not be paid for until April or May.
What happens to me if Campeau collapses between now and then?" 

Some credit concerns, such as Bernard Sands Credit Consultants Inc., have told clients not to ship anything to Federated or Allied stores on credit. "This is especially true for spring merchandise," says Jim Rindos, credit manager at Bernard Sands. "Campeau has too much debt." 

Other credit houses, such as Credit Exchange and Solo Credit Service Corp., are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping. "Payments are good right now, but we aren't recommending any long-term lines of credit," says Richard Hastings, a retail credit analyst, referring to credit lines which make inventory purchases automatic. "The Campeau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze." 

Because of those concerns, some manufacturers say they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise. "We're being paid today, but we're worried about tomorrow and will want" letters of credit, says the sales director at one major dress maker who asked not to be identified. 

Howard Bloom, president of the dress firm Chetta B Inc., says: "It's big time chaos today.
I'm going to ship and hope I get paid.
If I need to ask for money up front later, I will." 

Carol Sanger, vice president, corporate communications at Campeau, says that all of the Federated and Allied chains are paying their bills in a timely manner. "They continue to pay their bills and will do so," says Ms. Sanger. "We're confident we'll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as well." 

Typically, manufacturers are paid 10 days after the month in which they ship.
If goods are shipped to Bloomingdale's between Oct. 1 and Oct. 20, manufacturers expect to be paid by Nov. 10. 

But manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods won't be paid until March, April or even May.
Some in the market question whether Campeau will be in a position to pay bills at that time. 

"Everybody is worried about the possibility of cancellations," says Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. "The buyers who work for the various Campeau chains may lose their jobs.
The stores they work for may be sold.
What that will mean for manufacturers is anybody's guess." 

Campeau's financial situation is complicated by an estimated $1.23 billion in debt due next spring.
This includes a working capital facility for Allied Stores of $350 million that matures March 15, 1990, and an $800 million bridge loan due April 30, 1990.
The company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its March 1990 payments.
In recent months, numerous retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including Bonwit Teller, B. Altman & Co., and Miller & Rhoads Inc.
Those filings, plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains, such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's and Bloomingdale's, have added to the anxiety. 

"Right now, Federated owes us a considerable amount of money," says Morris Marmalstein, president of David Warren Enterprises, a major dress manufacturer. "We expect they will be current with their debts by the end of the week, but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders." 

Mr. Marmalstein adds that his company is now holding some goods in anticipation of being paid in full. "It's become a day-by-day business," he says. "Business has never been this tough before.
Not only does your product have to be excellent, but you also have to be able to collect." 

Other manufacturers are equally cautious.
Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller Inc., says his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the Federated and Allied chains.
This limits his financial exposure, he says. 

"The branches are just warmed over, empty halls," says Mr. Konheim. "Why should I be part of that problem?
I've got limited production, and I can't give it to underperformers." 

Campeau's Ms. Sanger disputes Mr. Konheim's comments. "Many of the branches are very lucrative," she says. "That's just nonsense." 

As for Mr. Levy at St. Gillian, he says he will maintain his credit lines with the various Campeau stores unless they miss a payment. "If they slip for 10 cents for 10 minutes, I'll stop," he says. 

Dennis R. Mangino, a general manager of EniChem Americas, was named vice president of research and development, a new post at this steel company. 

The bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that TW Services, a group of restaurant chains, became the latest prospective issuer to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers. 

The good news -- to fans of stable credit, at least -- is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers.
Apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk. 

Coniston Partners, which with related entities controls 80% of TW, had been planning to sell $1.15 billion of junk bonds, among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares. 

But Coniston, a New York partnership managed by the firm of Gollust, Tierney & Oliver, yesterday announced that "in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets" the offering would be postponed and restructured.
What wasn't mentioned is that Coniston and its investment banker, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, just completed a two-week "road show" for the purpose of marketing the bonds.
And investors, at least for now, took a pass. 

TW's junk bonds weren't, as junk bonds go, unusually weak.
Its fast-food restaurants -- including Denny's, Hardee's, Quincy's and El Pollo Loco ("the only significant fast-food chain to specialize in char-broiled chicken") -- are stable, recession-resistant and growing.
But unless they continued to grow, TW, based in Paramus, N.J., would have run into trouble. 

Until recently, such buy-now, pray-for-growth-later deals were routine. "But people don't buy anything on expectation anymore," says Jack Utter, who manages the high-yield fund of IDS Financial Services. "Investors," he adds, "are getting religion." The TW buy-out may yet be financed. "There is nothing wrong with the company," says Coniston principal Paul Tierney.
The rub, he says, is that "the junk market isn't as deep" as before.
TW's stockholder meeting was postponed from tomorrow to Nov. 21.
By then, DLJ hopes to be able to sell less-junky junk bonds. 

Gollust, Tierney & Oliver is likely to contribute more than the $120 million in equity it had planned on.
Banks may contribute more senior debt.
And the total amount of junk financing will be reduced. 

A DLJ banker, putting a best possible face on it, asserts that "very few people said they didn't like the credit quality.
People said they didn't think a billion-dollar deal would trade." 

But trading risk stems from credit risk.
And by adding equity, DLJ would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern.
Indeed, the DLJ banker says, in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest "will meaningfully improve." As he sums it up: "We are listening to the market." 

What is it, to borrow a term from Coniston, that so unsettled the market?
Some of the same risks that were cited -- and seemingly ignored -- in dozens of previous junk offerings. 

The TW prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier, pretax earnings "would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges, including interest on debt securities," by approximately $62.7 million in the first six months of 1989.
TW notes, as many junk issuers do, that "adjusted to eliminate non-cash charges" TW would have run a cash surplus -- in this case, of $56 million over six months. 

But such calculations ignore the noncash charge of depreciation, taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french friers, deterioration of stores and the like.
In fact, DLJ says, the company envisions capital expenses of about $180 million a year. 

TW's pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have risen steadily and that people won't stop eating during a downturn.
But they won't necessarily eat at Denny's.
The fast-food business is "intensely competitive," notes Wertheim Schroder analyst John Rohs.
Prospective bond buyers noted that TW historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus. 

"We were concerned that they weren't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt," says a big investor in high-yield debt.
DLJ argues that TW could, if necessary, cut capital spending, since half of what it plans to spend is for "growth," rather than maintenance.
But investors noted that under the shelved offering, TW would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments.
Its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $52 million a year in interest on cash-deferred, or zero-coupon debentures -- which ultimately would have had to be paid. 

The prospectus notes "there can be no assurance" that future growth will continue at past levels.
In the recent past, bond buyers didn't seek such assurance.
Now, apparently, they do.

Bay Financial Corp., Boston, which has been reporting big losses and warning of a possible bankruptcy-law filing, said it was sued by a holder. 

The real estate investment trust said the "purported class action suit," seeks "damages and other remedies under federal securities law and state law." Gerald E. Wilson, corporate secretary and legal counsel, said the company wouldn't disclose further details.
He declined to name the shareholder, the plaintiff's lawyer or the court where the lawsuit was filed. 

Bay, which has substantial investments in the floundering Massachusetts market, reported a loss of $62 million, or $15.97 a share, for the fiscal year ended June 30.
It has said it might seek bankruptcy-court protection from creditor lawsuits if it can't renegotiate its borrowings. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Bay closed at $2.625, down 25 cents. 

Ford Motor Co. said it is consolidating control of its Asian operations under a new organization here that will be headed by W. Wayne Booker. 

Ford Asia-Pacific will coordinate the activities of Ford subsidiaries in Japan, Australia, Taiwan and New Zealand and work with Ford business associates throughout the region.
These functions are currently performed out of Melbourne, Australia, and at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. 

Mr. Booker, executive director of Ford's Latin America Automotive Operations since December 1988, was named vice president of Ford Asia-Pacific. 

Esselte AB, the Stockholm office supplies company, as expected, proposed to acquire the 22% it doesn't own of its U.S. unit, Esselte Business Systems Inc. 

The price in the proposal is $43.50 for each of the 4.9 million shares the parent doesn't own, or $213.2 million. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Esselte closed yesterday at $43.50 a share, up $1. 

A committee of outside directors for the Garden City, N.Y., unit is evaluating the proposal; the parent asked it to respond by Oct. 31.
The unit said it can provide no assurance a transaction will occur. 

Esselte AB sold the minority stake five years ago in a $40 million international share offering.
The unit, which is the holding company for Esselte's non-Swedish units, accounted for 58% of sales and 71% of operating profit last year. 

Separately, Esselte Business Systems reported third-quarter net income fell 5.9% to $9.5 million, or 46 cents a share, from $10.1 million, or 49 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
Sales rose 2.9% to $329.2 million from $320 million. 

THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY'S 1988 costs of fund raising and administration were $72.4 million, or 23.2% of its revenue.

AVON RENT-A-CAR & TRUCK Corp. said it declared a dividend of one warrant for each three shares of common stock.
Currently, Avon, based in Santa Monica, Calif., has 3.3 million common shares outstanding.
About 1.1 million Class C warrants were issued, the company said.
Each of the Class C warrants will enable the holders to purchase one share of common stock at $5.50.
The warrants may be exercised until 90 days after their issue date.
Avon also said it will issue an additional 243,677 of the Class C warrants to holders of its Class A, Class B and unclassified warrants.
Issuance of those warrants will be at the rate of one-third warrant for each warrant exercised. 

French consumer prices rose 0.2% in September from August, according to provisional estimates by the National Statistics Institute. 

The agency noted that because of a strike by Finance Ministry personnel the provisional estimate doesn't correspond exactly to the consumer price index usually published.
The agency noted, however, the estimate will likely be confirmed. 

The institute didn't estimate annual price growth in September, but a 0.2% rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9, up 3.3% or 3.4% from the year-earlier level of 173.1.
The index was 178.5 in August and is based on 1980 equaling 100. 

ITT Corp., its insurance business hurt by Hurricane Hugo, reported a 4% decline in third-quarter net income, despite a 4.2% rise in revenue. 

ITT also forecast a fourth-quarter blow to earnings from the California earthquake.
Except for insurance, however, ITT said it expects improved operating earnings "in all of our businesses for the full year." 

Third-quarter net income dropped to $221 million, or $1.55 a share, from $230 million, or $1.60 a share, in the year-earlier period.
ITT bought back 8.8 million shares this year, including 2.8 million during the third quarter. 

Third-quarter revenue rose to $4.9 billion from $4.7 billion. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, ITT common stock fell 62.5 cents to close at $58.75 a share. 

In addition to insurance and finance, ITT has interests in electronic parts, defense technology, automotive parts, fluid technology, pulp and timber, and communications and information services. 

"Hurricane Hugo losses and the continuing industrywide downturn in the property and casualty insurance business were the major factors affecting quarterly comparisons," said Rand V. Araskog, chairman and chief executive officer. 

ITT's Hartford Insurance Group had a $53 million quarterly pretax loss from Hurricane Hugo, ITT said.
Hartford expects to report a further pretax loss of about $30 million for the current quarter, as a result of the California earthquake this month, ITT added. 

The company also disclosed its financial operations had increased reserves for bankrupt accounts, resulting in a $40 million pretax charge for the third quarter.
This charge was partly offset, however, by $19 million in pretax capital gains. 

ITT also said its consumer finance unit agreed in September to settle a civil suit with the California attorney general over alleged improper lending and sales practices.
Anticipating this settlement, the company recorded a pretax charge of $24 million during the fourth quarter of 1988.
An ITT spokesman said the charge wasn't publicly reported at the time. 

"The company's product businesses, with the exception of electronic components, had higher operating earnings for the first nine months of 1989," the company said.
Elaborating on the exception, it said volume and margins were lower in semiconductor and power systems operations. 

Environmental Control Group Inc. said it expects to report "minimal" earnings or a loss for the third quarter. 

The environmental services company said that the discontinuation of unsuccessful product lines and an increase in baddebt reserves probably will result in charges of $2.5 million to $4 million, most of which will be taken against third-quarter results. 

In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of $2.2 million, or 35 cents a share. 

In a stunning shift in direction, Provigo Inc. said it will sell all its non-food operations to concentrate solely on its retail and wholesale grocery business.
The non-food operations accounted for about 27% of Provigo's 7.38 billion Canadian dollars (US$6.3 billion) in sales in the latest fiscal year. 

In a related move, Pierre Lortie, chairman and chief executive, resigned.
Mr. Lortie joined Provigo in 1985 and spearheaded the company's drive to grow outside its traditional food business.
He couldn't be reached for comment. 

Bertin Nadeau, newly appointed chairman and interim chief executive of Provigo, wouldn't say if Mr. Lortie was asked to leave. "Mr.
Lortie felt less pertinent," Mr. Nadeau said, given the decision to dump Provigo's non-food operations. "At this stage it was felt I was perhaps more pertinent as chief executive." Mr. Nadeau also is chairman and chief executive of Unigesco Inc., Provigo's controlling shareholder. 

At a news conference, Mr. Nadeau said the sale of the three non-food businesses, which account for nearly half the company's C$900 million in assets, should be completed in a "matter of months." The three units are a nationwide pharmaceutical and health-products distributor, a small sporting-goods chain, and a combination catalog showroom and toy-store chain. 

Investors and analysts applauded the news.
Provigo was the most active industrial stock on the Montreal Exchange, where it closed at C$9.75 (US$8.32), up 75 Canadian cents. 

"I think it's a pretty positive development," said Ross Cowan, a financial analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., of the decision to concentrate on groceries.
Mr. Lortie's departure, while sudden, was seen as inevitable in light of the shift in strategy. "The non-food operations were largely Mr. Lortie's creation {and} his strategy didn't work," said Steven Holt, a financial analyst with Midland Doherty Ltd. 

Provigo's profit record over the past two years tarnished the company's and Mr. Lortie's reputations.
For the six months ended Aug. 12, Provigo posted net income of C$6.5 million, or eight Canadian cents a share, compared with C$18.1 million, or 21 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales were C$4.2 billion compared with C$3.7 billion.
Last month, Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded Provigo's commercial paper and debentures because of its lackluster performance. 

Analysts are skeptical Provigo will be able to sell the non-food businesses as a group for at least book value, and are expecting write-downs.
Mr. Nadeau said he couldn't yet say if the sale prices would match book values.
He said all three non-food operations are profitable. 

Mr. Nadeau said discussions are under way with potential purchasers of each of the units.
He declined to confirm or deny reports that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit.
Mr. Roy couldn't be reached. 

Yvon Bussieres was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Provigo, a new position.
Mr. Bussieres was president and chief operating officer of Provigo's Quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit.
Mr. Nadeau said he intends to remain Provigo's chief executive only until the non-food businesses are sold, after a which a new chief executive will be named. 

Richard D. Sutton, 64 years old, chairman of this bank-holding company, was named acting president and chief executive officer of the company and its First National Bank of Toms River subsidiary.
Joseph W. Robertson, 61, was dismissed from those posts, the company said.
He couldn't be reached and a company spokesman wouldn't comment on the dismissal.
Mr. Robertson was also removed from the board of First National Bank of New Jersey-Salem County, another unit, and the Toms River bank. 

McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. must extend its offer for LIN Broadcasting Corp. because it has "not yet announced committed financing sufficient to complete" the bid, LIN said in New York. 

According to Securities and Exchange Commission rules, McCaw is required to keep its offer for the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern open for at least five business days after the announcement of the financing, LIN said.
McCaw's offer is scheduled to expire tomorrow. 

Last week, McCaw said it obtained "firm" financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its bid to control LIN Broadcasting.
The banks jointly committed $1.2 billion of financing, subject to certain conditions, McCaw said. 

A spokesman for McCaw said the company was "moving forward with our financing." He added that "hopefully LIN will conduct a fair auction." 

McCaw wants to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $125 each, or $2.75 billion, which would result in McCaw's owning 50.3% of LIN.
The offer is in limbo, however, because LIN has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with BellSouth Corp. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, LIN rose 50 cents, to $109.25. 

Fred D. Thompson, a 47-year-old attorney in private practice in Washington and Nashville, Tenn., was elected to the board of this engineering and construction company.
The board increased to 11 seats. 

Law firms that have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines. 

The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has reverberated through some of the nation's largest law firms. 

While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary, many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work, which has been so lucrative in the past.
Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour.
If deals take longer to complete and there are fewer of them to do, "you can't bill the same kind of premium as when deals took a few weeks from start to finish," says one lawyer at a large New York firm. 

"We're planning on a rip-roaring year in 1989, but next year we'll be another story," said Robert Freedman, a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. "We're settling down to a less active period." 

Lawyers at such firms as Sullivan & Cromwell; Willkie Farr & Gallagher; Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson all say they, too, have experienced a significant slowdown, particularly during the past few weeks. "Everyone is waiting to see if deals can be done at sensible prices and if money is available," said Jack Nusbaum, co-chairman of Willkie Farr. "It's hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical." 

Some lawyers say the slump, while more obvious in recent weeks, began earlier this year.
Dennis Block, a partner at the New York firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said that in the first eight months of this year, 89 hostile offers were launched, compared with 157 for the first eight months of 

What's more, he said, "transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing" and more stringent scrutiny by state courts.
Lawyers also say an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be proposed. 

Still, some lawyers say the mergers slowdown hasn't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones. "We just took another floor for our London offices," said Joseph Flom of the New York firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. 

Davis Polk & Wardwell also said its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy. "European companies are looking to buy American ones," said Henry King, the managing partner at that firm. "But the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions." 

MURDER THREAT charged in Haas Securities Corp. stock-manipulation trial. 

In the trial of former Haas Securities Chairman Eugene Laff, the defense accused one of the government's chief witnesses of threatening to kill Mr. Laff. 

Mr. Laff's attorney, John Lang, filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness, Henry Lorin, told a Haas stockbroker that Mr. Laff should be killed.
The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what Mr. Lang said was an effort to get Mr. Lorin to implicate Mr. Laff.
In his opening arguments last week in federal court in New York, Mr. Lang told the jury that Mr. Lorin was the "real master criminal" behind the stock manipulation, and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it. 

In March, Mr. Laff was indicted on 15 counts of conspiracy, mail and securities fraud, and obstructing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The government has charged that Mr. Lorin and Mr. Laff were part of a conspiracy to maintain the prices of certain stocks at artificially high prices.
Mr. Lorin, a stock promoter, pleaded guilty to the stock-manipulation charges in April and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation of Mr. Laff. 

During his cross examination of Mr. Lorin, Mr. Lang read from the transcripts of a conversation that was taped Oct. 20, 1988.
Stanley Aslanian, the Haas broker who agreed to carry a hidden microphone during the conversation, also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed to cooperate. 

According to the transcript, Mr. Lorin said Mr. Laff should be killed after Mr. Aslanian told him that information given to Mr. Laff by another conspirator could jeopardize the stock scheme.
Mr. Lorin then repeated the threat, and Mr. Aslanian urged him not to say such things. 

From the parts of the transcript read by Mr. Lang, it was unclear what exactly Mr. Lorin feared might happen.
When asked for a copy of the transcript, Mr. Lang said Judge Thomas P. Griesa had instructed him not to release it or the memorandum. 

During the trial, Mr. Lang asked Mr. Lorin whether he had been so upset "that you considered killing Mr. Laff? . . . Isn't it true that you were so worked up that framing Mr. Laff for this crime was the least that you planned for him?" Mr. Lorin responded, "No." When Mr. Lang asked Mr. Lorin whether he had taken steps to have Mr. Laff killed, the witness again said no. 

Peter Lieb, the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case, declined to comment on the trial. 

TRUSTEE WHO MONITORED settlement payments to Dalkon Shield claimants quits. 

Stephen A. Saltzburg, one of five trustees appointed to monitor payments to women injured by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine contraceptive, resigned, citing personal reasons. 

Mr. Saltzburg, who teaches evidence at the University of Virginia School of Law and was a deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Justice Department until August, submitted his resignation earlier this month to federal Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., in Richmond, Va.
Judge Merhige is overseeing the bankruptcy-law reorganization of A.H. Robins Co., the company that manufactured the shield.
In a letter Monday to Mr. Saltzburg, the judge said he would "reluctantly" accept the resignation. 

The $2.38 billion Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust was established as part of A.H. Robins' bankruptcy-reorganization plan to resolve injury claims arising from use of the shield.
American Home Products Corp. proposes to acquire the company. 

The remaining four trustees on the Claimants Trust have 60 days to nominate a successor to Mr. Saltzburg.
Judge Merhige will make the appointment. 

CHICAGO LAW FIRM recruits American Express Co. vice president: Coffield Ungaretti Harris & Slavin brought in Howard A. Menell as a partner in its Washington, D.C., office, which opened Oct. 1.
For the past six years, Mr. Menell, 43 years old, served as vice president for government affairs at American Express.
He previously was staff director and counsel for the Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs.
The other lawyer in the office is partner Robert A. Macari, the firm's legislative director. 

THE PHILADELPHIA law firm of Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll said three partners have joined its business and finance department.
John Ake, 48, a former vice-president in charge of legal compliance at American Capital Management & Research Inc., in Houston, will join Ballard Spahr's corporate-securities practice.
Kent Walker, 45, a former partner at the Philadelphia law firm of Mesirov, Gelman, Jaffe, Cramer & Jamieson, will specialize in antitrust, real estate and mergers and acquisitions.
Richard L. Sherman, 42, will advise midsized businesses.
Mr. Sherman is former deputy general counsel for SmithKline Beckman Corp., in Philadelphia, now SmithKline Beecham PLC, in London. 

Delmed Inc. 's top two officers resigned and were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent, Fresenius AG, a major Delmed holder that has been negotiating to acquire a controlling stake. 

In addition, Delmed, which makes and sells a dialysis solution used in treating kidney diseases, said negotiations about pricing had collapsed between it and a major distributor, National Medical Care Inc. 

Delmed said Robert S. Ehrlich resigned as chairman, president and chief executive.
Mr. Ehrlich will continue as a director and a consultant.
Leslie I. Shapiro, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, also resigned, the company said. 

Mr. Ehrlich was succeeded as chairman by Gerd Krick, a director of Fresenius, a West German pharmaceutical concern.
Ben Lipps, president of Fresenius USA, was named president, chief executive and chief operating officer. 

None of the officials was available for comment. 

In trading on the American Stock Exchange, Delmed closed at 50 cents, down 6.25 cents. 

Fresenius owns about 42% of Delmed's fully diluted common stock.
The two companies have been discussing a transaction under which Fresenius would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70% and 80% of Delmed's fully diluted common stock.
The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed. 

Under the proposal, Delmed would issue about 123.5 million additional Delmed common shares to Fresenius at an average price of about 65 cents a share, though under no circumstances more than 75 cents a share. 

Yesterday, Delmed said it "continues to explore the possibility of a combination with Fresenius USA." It added that it is apparent that any terms of a combination "would be substantially less favorable than those previously announced." 

While the discussions between Delmed and National Medical Care have been discontinued, Delmed will continue to supply dialysis products through National Medical after their exclusive agreement ends in March 1990, Delmed said.
In addition, Delmed is exploring distribution arrangements with Fresenius USA, Delmed said. 

Kennametal Inc. said it intends to acquire J&L America Inc. for $44 million plus a consideration of as much as an additional $12 million, payable over five years. 

Kennametal is a carbide-products and cutting-tools company.
J&L, whose principal offices are in Detroit, is a mail-order distributer of industrial tools and supplies. 

The acquisition is subject to approval by Kennametal's board. 

Spiegel Inc., citing continuing improvement in the apparel market, said third-quarter net income jumped 65% from the soft year-earlier period, on an 11% increase in revenue. 

The catalog retailer reported net income of $10.8 million, or 21 cents a share, up sharply from $6.6 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $372.1 million from $336.4 million. 

Spiegel said margins improved because its inventory position this year didn't need the costly markdowns required to trim last year's swollen levels.
A spokeswoman said the apparel market troughed in the first half of 1988, then began showing improvement in the second half of last year. "We've seen continued improvement in 1989," she said. 

The year-ago quarter's results were crimped by expenses associated with Spiegel's $260 million acquisition of catalog-clothing-merchandiser Eddie Bauer, Spiegel noted.
In addition, the company said ongoing cost-cutting efforts contributed to the latest period's earnings upturn. 

Spiegel is 84%-controlled by the Otto family of West Germany.
In national over-the-counter trading, the company's shares climbed 37.5 cents to $20.375. 

For the latest nine months, Spiegel's net climbed a solid 47% to $23.8 million, or 46 cents a share, from $16.2 million, or 34 cents.
Unlike the quarter's results, which were based on roughly equal shares outstanding, nine-month per-share figures reflect an increase in average common shares outstanding to 51.9 million from 47 million.
Nine-month revenue was $1.02 billion, up 22% from $841.5 million. 

Quickview Systems Inc. said it filed a lawsuit against Apple Computer Inc., claiming patent infringement in an element of Apple's popular HyperCard software program. 

The suit, filed in Minneapolis federal court, claims that Apple violated a Quickview patent that allows computer users to display "only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire contents of any given field." 

The HyperCard program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every Macintosh sold.
It's one of the most popular computer programs of all time, but analysts said the Quickview suit doesn't appear to bode major difficulties for Apple. 

The technology at issue "is not an underlying technology of HyperCard to my knowledge," said Danny Goodman, a San Francisco-area HyperCard program developer. 

Nonetheless, the suit seeks unspecified damages that an attorney for Quickview claimed could run into the millions of dollars. 

In Cupertino, Calif., Apple said that it believes the case has no merit, and that HyperCard does not infringe "any valid claims" of the Quickview patents.
It said it filed an action of its own in federal court in San Jose, Calif., seeking a declaration that Quickview's claims are invalid. 

PAPERS: Thomson Corp. 's Globe & Mail newspaper in November will begin transmitting an experimental edition to selected subscribers' facsimile machines.
The four-page news summary will be aimed at readers outside Canada or in Canadian locations where the national daily isn't available on the day of publication.
In the U.S., the Hartford Courant has a facsimile edition and some other newspapers are considering the idea. 

WHO'S NEWS: Michael T. Carr, advertising director of Playboy magazine, was named publisher of National Lampoon and Heavy Metal magazines, succeeding George Agoglia.
It was the first management change since film-makers Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson took control of National Lampoon Inc. in March.
They are looking for a new editor for National Lampoon and are trying to sell Heavy Metal. 

Delta Air Lines earnings soared 33% to a record in the fiscal first quarter, bucking the industry trend toward declining profits. 

The Atlanta-based airline, the third largest in the U.S., attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic, new international routes and reduced service by rival Eastern Airlines, which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began last spring. 

For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Delta posted net income of $133.1 million, or $2.53 a share, up from $100 million, or $2.03 a share, a year earlier. 

Revenue rose 15% to $2.17 billion from $1.89 billion.
During the quarter, Delta issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to Swissair, and repurchased 1.1 million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan. 

"The key to Delta's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth," said Thomas Roeck, chief financial officer.
Passenger traffic jumped 14% in the quarter, while profit per passenger grew 2%. 

Delta has benefited more than other carriers from the weakness of Eastern Airlines, which shares the Atlanta hub.
Although Eastern is back to about 80% of its pre-strike schedule now, the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter. 

Separately, America West Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., reported third-quarter profit jumped 45% to $5.8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $4 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest results include a $2.6 million one-time payment from a "foreign entity." America West wouldn't identify the entity, but said the payment was for the foreign company's use of certain tax benefits in connection with America West plane purchases.
Year-earlier results included an extraordinary gain of $1.6 million from a buy-back of convertible subordinated debentures. 

Revenue rose 21% to $243.4 million from $201.2 million.
For the nine months, America West posted earnings of $18.9 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with a loss of $9.7 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 27% to $715.1 million from $563.8 million. 

French chemicals group, Orkem S.A., said Wednesday it has made a bid for control of Coates Brothers PLC, a British manufacturer of inks and polyester resins. 

State-controlled Orkem already owns 40.6% of Coates.
The remainder is held by the public and by family interests, a spokeswoman for the French group said. 

Orkem declined to give details of its offer, saying only that the bid will be submitted for approval by the board of the British company. 

The White House called on Congress to attach the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction bill, but lawmakers seem likely to balk at the idea. 

Earlier this month, the White House endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that Congress could pass quickly a "clean" bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm-Rudman act. 

But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets, the White House said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill, on which Congress continues to work. "If that doesn't happen, then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote," said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 

On Capitol Hill, though, there doesn't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill.
Texas Rep. William Archer, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said, "I don't see how we have the votes" to place a capital-gains tax cut there. 

Meanwhile, President Bush stepped up his personal lobbying for the capital-gains tax cut.
The White House said he plans to hold a series of private White House meetings, mostly with Senate Democrats, to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut. 

The first meeting yesterday was with 10 Senate Democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax.
According to some who attended, the senators argued that the president should give the Democratic leaders in Congress a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue.
Issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending.
The president was said to have been noncommittal. 

International Technology Corp. and Davy McKee Corp., a unit of London's Davy Corp., said they were awarded a $55 million contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the closure of the Helen Kramer Landfill Superfund site in Mantua Township, N.J. 

International Technology, an environmental management concern, said the contract includes construction of slurry walls, gas collection systems, a multilayer cap and water treatment plant. 

Robert L. Wood, 37-year-old chief financial officer, was named chairman and chief executive officer of this independent power producer, succeeding Raymond L. Hixson, 63.
Mr. Hixson, who resigned effective Jan. 1 for health reasons, remains a director. 

NICHOLS INSTITUTE declared a 2-for-1 split of its common stock, payable Nov. 27 to stock of record Nov. 10.
The clinical testing services holding company is based in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. 

Italian car manufacturer Fiat said it isn't interested in partnership or industrial cooperation with Swedish auto and aerospace group Saab-Scania AB, which faces heavy losses in its car division. 

Fiat said it's only interested in technical cooperation with Saab. 

"We know that Saab is looking for a partner for industrial and financial cooperation," Fiat said. "But that partner isn't Fiat." 

The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab, but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy Saab's car division. 

Fiat's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company, which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49%, will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have turned down the offer. 

News reports said yesterday that Saab is trying to start negotiations with French automakers Peugeot and Renault. 

Amoco Corp. said it plans to install two platforms and drill as many as 22 wells to develop oil reserves it discovered in the Atlantic Ocean about 25 miles off the coast of Congo. 

Amoco, an energy concern, is the operator of the project with a 43.75% working interest, and other partners include Hydro Congo, the Congolese state oil company, with a 50% interest, and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. with a 6.25% stake.
Production is expected to be about 40,000 barrels of oil a day after completion of the drilling program. 

West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, seemed tethered again yesterday in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Widely expected to open 10 to 15 cents a barrel higher on the strength of statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, the December contract managed to start the session only eight cents higher. 

In the last hour of the trading day, December contract took a tumble to end the session 10 cents lower at $19.62 a barrel.
And now that the price has fallen below $19.65, which many had said showed considerable resistance, some traders and analysts figure there's little to stop the price from going lower on technical decisions. 

With no petroleum-related news or changes in the fundamentals to dictate price moves, "technicians are wanting to sell this stuff," said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp. "And short-term, the technicians may have their way." 

The market quickly discounted the weekly inventory report showing a 6.3 million barrel decrease in U.S. crude oil stocks as the legacy of Hurricane Jerry.
That storm hit the Gulf Coast Oct. 13, closing the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port for a time and preventing tankers from unloading.
Next week's report could very well show an increase in crude inventories. 

Dismissing the trade group's numbers left traders plenty of time to worry anew about the latest reports on OPEC production.
An AP-Dow Jones survey of integrated oil companies, independent refiners, and oil industry consultants indicates that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production to 22.2 million barrels a day in September.
Estimates suggest October's figure may be even higher. 

That level of production isn't of much concern as long as demand continues strong, analysts said.
But the first quarter of the year is generally the weakest and OPEC production doesn't seem to be slackening in anticipation of that.
Also, maintaining current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies. 

To top off the bearish factors affecting yesterday's trading, late October weather, especially in the Northeast U.S., continues to be very moderate, leaving heating oil futures trading lackluster. "We aren't seeing any cold weather here," Mr. Bolling said from New York. 

In other commodity markets yesterday: 

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends, as well as continued export strength.
A leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices.
Wheat futures prices fell, however, at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million bushels of wheat by commodity speculator Richard Dennis.
Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company, C&D Commodities, could be reached for comment.
As for corn and soybean futures, "a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying" supported prices in early trading, said Steven Freed, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
Soybean futures for November delivery gained 5.25 cents a bushel to close at $5.66 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
December corn futures added 2.25 cents a bushel to close at $2.4225 a bushel on the Board of Trade.
Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures prices. "Russian ships are arriving in the gulf and there isn't enough grain in the pipeline," said Katharina Zimmer, a futures analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York.
The Soviet Union has purchased roughly eight million tons of grain this month, and is expected to take delivery by year end, analysts said. 

COTTON: Futures prices rose modestly, but trading volume wasn't very heavy.
The December contract settled at 73.97 cents a pound, up 0.59 cent, but it rose as high as 74.20 cents.
Several cotton analysts said that the move appeared to be mostly technical.
Traders who had sold contracts earlier, in hopes of buying them back at lower prices, yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses.
Floor traders also said that the market could have been helped by rumors, which have been circulating for the past two days, about China purchasing cotton.
The rumor, which has been neither confirmed nor denied, has China buying 125,000 to 200,000 bales for near-term delivery.
One floor trader said that if there were Chinese purchases, they should have had a bigger effect on the market.
Another said that if China was a buyer, it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the 1979-80 crop year, and thus would be a bullish sign.
This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists, who see higher prices ahead, and the technicians, who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range, around 71 cents, and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents.
This trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able to exceed 75.75 cents.
He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1, 1990, are currently projected at 3.3 million bales, the smallest end-of-season supply since 1985. 

COCOA: The modest sell-off, which started on Tuesday, continued.
The December contract ended at $999 a metric ton, down $15.
The market is drifting, at least partly, because of a lack of crop information out of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, the two largest African producers.
Harry Schwartz, a soft commodity specialist for Cargill Investors Services in New York, said the only report Ghana has issued about the arrival of cocoa from the interior was for 7,839 metric tons as of Oct. 12.
By this time last year, he noted, arrivals totaling 33,270 tons had been announced.
A similar situation apparently exists in the Ivory Coast with no figures released yet this year, compared with 55,000 tons as of this time a year ago.
He said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports, shipping delays could result.
This is the worry that probably brought steadiness to the market earlier in the week, he said.
There was also some fear that without Ivory Coast cocoa a large French cocoa merchant, Cie.
Financiere Sucre et Denrees, might not be able to deliver cocoa against the contracts it had sold earlier for December delivery in London.
However, the French merchant has about 200,000 tons of old crop Ivory Coast cocoa stored in the Netherlands from an agreement it had negotiated with the Ivory Coast last spring.
Cargill thinks that even though the merchant has a contract stating that it won't bring this cocoa to market until after March 1991, there is some evidence the contract has been modified.
This modification, apparently, would permit the French merchant to deliver this cocoa, if necessary, against existing short positions. 

Keith A. Tucker was named a director of this insurance and financial services concern.
Mr. Tucker, 44 years old, is president of Trivest Securities Corp. and senior vice president of Trivest Inc., closely held investment companies based in Miami.
His selection increases the size of the board to 12 members.
Torchmark also said that Samuel E. Upchurch Jr., 37, vice president and general counsel, was selected to serve the remainder of the term vacated by John S.P. Samford, who resigned as director. 

StatesWest Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., said it sent a more detailed merger proposal to much-larger Mesa Airlines. 

Farmington, N.M.-based Mesa has consistently rejected StatesWest's offers, and early this week said its board wouldn't give the proposal further consideration, calling it "vague and ill-defined" because it didn't describe the source of funds or the specific terms of StatesWest securities which were part of the offer. 

The new letter purports to do this, saying that in addition to $7 a share in cash, StatesWest would offer one share of new 6% convertible preferred stock of StatesWest it values at $3 a share.
It also said the cash portion of the transaction would be financed with StatesWest's own cash and short-term investments, plus debt and other financing arranged through Hibbard Brown & Co., the company's investment banker. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Mesa closed at $7.25, up 25 cents. 

StatesWest asked Mesa to repond by Oct. 31.
Mesa President Larry Risley said his board had received Stateswest's most recent offer and was reviewing it. 

Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said business failures fell 17.8% to 11,586 in the third quarter from 14,099 in the year-earlier period. 

In the first nine months of this year, business failures dropped 15.6% to 37,820 from 44,796. 

Except for a few spots, notably Georgia, Virginia and Michigan, failures declined almost across the board, according to the business information services company.
D&B defines a business failure as a company that closes with losses to creditors. 

The current decline in failures continues a trend begun in late 1987, D&B said.
The drop accelerated in this year's third quarter, underscoring an overall lack of stress in the U.S. economy, the company said. 

Failures in seven of nine regional areas fell more than 10% in the nine months.
The South Atlantic States were the only region to report an increase in bankruptcies, up 5.3% to 5,791 from 5,502.
This occurred partly because of more competition as the number of new businesses surged. 

The only industry sector to report more business failures for the nine months was the finance, insurance and real-estate sector, where bankruptcies grew 8.1% to 2,046 from 1,892.
The troubled savings-and-loan industry and subsequent stress in real-estate businesses fueled bankruptcies in this sector, D&B said. 

Eastman Kodak Co. of Rochester, N.Y., said its Lehn & Fink Products subsidiary was restructured to form two operating groups, one for household products such as cleaners and disinfectants and the other for do-it-yourself products such as wood finishes and stains. 

The Montvale, N.J., unit said the new operating structure "creates a more focused and responsive organization geared to effectively managing the size and scope of the unit's current business." 

The consumer brands unit was absorbed by the photographic, pharmaceutical and chemical concern last year when it acquired Sterling Drug Inc. 

In a related matter, Peter Black, president of consumer brand Minwax, was named group vice president for the household products operating group.
Kenneth M. Evans, president of Thompson & Formby brand, was named group vice president of the do-it-yourself operating group. 

Wall Street would like UAL Corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent.
But what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company's two most powerful and fractious unions: the pilots and machinists. 

Some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous $6.79 billion buy-out, if anything, may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups.
As a result, both may now have virtual veto power over any UAL transaction. 

One reason: banks -- likely to react to any new UAL deal with even more caution than the first time around -- probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a less-ambitious recapitalization plan. 

"United pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike," said an executive at Fuji Bank, one of UAL's large lenders. "If you have both {labor} groups on strike, you've got no revenue and that's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at." 

Just this past week, a leading Japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists' union leaders to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible. 

Another reason: Emboldened by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction, the machinists are likely to be more aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs. 

The two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts.
That gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work. 

Thus, even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key. "There's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions' cooperation and wage concessions," said Richard Nye, of Baker, Nye Investments, a New York takeover stock-trader.
Mr. Nye thinks the UAL board should be ousted if it doesn't move soon to increase shareholder value. 

Both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they don't like. "The pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here," pilot union chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky declared yesterday.
But whether the pilots can team up with their longtime adversaries, the machinists, is another question. 

The pilots' Mr. Dubinsky says his union would like majority ownership for employees.
At the very least, the pilots want some form of control over the airline, perhaps through super-majority voting rights. 

On the other hand, the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle, saying they don't think employees should be owners. 

Still, in recent days, machinists' union leaders have shown some new flexibility. "We may be able to reach a tradeoff where we can accommodate {the pilot union's} concerns and ours," said Brian M. Freeman, the machinists' financial adviser. 

Mr. Freeman said machinists' union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders, an employee stake and, perhaps, an equity investment by a friendly investor. 

If a compromise can't be reached, the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists.
But at this point, that may just be wishful thinking. 

The machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from UAL pilots and management for the company.
Their opposition helped scare off some Japanese banks. 

The pilots' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve. "Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots' union?" asks Candace Browning, an analyst at Wertheim Schroeder & Co. "Who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots?" she adds. 

Ms. Browning says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots relent on their demand for control.
She also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now, they still could come back at a later time and try to take control. 

Another possibility is for the pilots' to team up with an outside investor who might try to force the ouster of the board through the solicitation of consents.
In that way, the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake, or to consider the labor-management group's latest proposal. 

The group didn't make a formal offer, but instead told UAL's advisers before the most-recent board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between $225 and $240 a share.
But again, they may need the help of the machinists. 

"I think the dynamics of this situation are that something's got to happen," said one official familiar with the situation.
The board and UAL's management, he says, "can't go back" to business as usual. "The pilots won't let them." 

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. 's Jacobs International unit was selected to design and build a microcomputer-systems manufacturing plant in County Kildare, Ireland, for Intel Corp. 

Jacobs is an international engineering and construction concern.
Total capital investment at the site could be as much as $400 million, according to Intel. 

The 150,000-square-foot plant will be constructed on a 55-acre site near Dublin.
Jacobs Engineering officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

Motorola is fighting back against junk mail.
So much of the stuff poured into its Austin, Texas, offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it.
Now, thousands of mailers, catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash. 

"We just don't have the staff to {deliver} it, nor do we have the space or the time," says a spokesman for the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics company, which has 5,000 employees in the Austin area. "It's the overload problem and the weight problem we have." 

Motorola is in good company.
Businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail, and some are saying they just aren't going to take it anymore -- literally.
While no one has tracked how many company mail rooms throw out junk mail, direct-mail advertising firms say the number is growing. 

General Motors earlier this year said it wouldn't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its Flint, Mich., office, while Air Products & Chemicals, Allentown, Pa., says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing. 

Why the revolt?
Anybody with a mailbox can answer that: sheer, overwhelming, mind-numbing volume.
According to the Direct Marketing Association, total direct mail -- to both businesses and consumers -- jumped 50% to 65.4 billion pieces in 1988 from five years earlier.
Though direct mail to businesses isn't broken out separately, the association says it's growing even faster. 

The deluge has spurred cost-conscious companies to action, with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it. 

The direct-mail industry, not surprisingly, is fuming at the injustice of it all.
After all, this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect, that is the butt of so many jokes that television's "L.A.
Law" portrays direct-mail-mogul David as short, bald, intensely nerdy, and unremittingly boring. 

The practice of businesses throwing out junk mail "is a commonly known problem, and it's increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board," right down to the mail-room level, says Stephen Belth, a list consultant and chairman of the Direct Marketing Association's business-to-business council. "But it's like biting the hand that feeds them, because every one of these companies uses direct marketing." 

It's almost impossible to track the number of companies trashing junk mail, since the decision is usually made in the mail room -- not the board room.
And the practice often varies from location to location even within a company.
But industry executives say businesses seem especially inclined to dump mailers sent to titles rather than to individual names. 

Motorola's Austin operation was one of the first to lose patience, deciding a few years ago to junk any bulk mail that wasn't addressed to an individual.
Magazines aren't delivered at all, even if an individual's name is listed; employees who want their magazines have to pick them up from the mail room or the company library -- and are told to change the subscriptions to their home addresses. 

At Air Products, meanwhile, the mailroom staff opens junk mail and often throws it away -- even if addressed to an individual. "If they get 50 packets of something, they open one, see what it says, throw 48 away and send two to people or departments they think are appropriate," a spokesman says. 

Direct marketers were especially alarmed when General Motors -- one of the country's largest companies and a big direct-mail user itself -- entered the junk-mail battle.
As of March 1, its Flint office, with about 2,500 employees, stopped delivering bulk mail and non-subscription magazines.
Employees were told that if they really wanted the publications, they would have to have them sent home instead.
The reason: overload, especially of non-subscription magazines. 

Direct-mail executives see GM's stand as an ominous sign -- even if the junk-mail kings did bring it on themselves. "Why anyone would want to close themselves off {from direct mail}, a priori, doesn't make any sense," says Michael Bronner of Bronner Slosberg Associates, a Boston directmail firm. "It smacks of big brotherism.
They're going to decide what their employees can or cannot read." 

The practice is, however, legal in most cases.
Jack Ellis, a U.S. postal inspector in New York, says the Postal Service's only job is to deliver the mail to the mail room; once it gets there, a company can do with it what it wishes. 

The junk-mail titans, ever optimistic, are looking for ways around the problem.
So far, they say, it hasn't had any noticeable effect on response rates.
And before it does, they're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place.
Among other things, the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications. "We're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter," says Jack Miller, president of Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., business-to-business mail-order company.
But then again, mailing less and smarter won't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway. 

New Hyundai Campaign 

Hyundai Motor America, fighting quality complaints, declining sales and management turmoil, yesterday unveiled its 1990 ad strategy, tagged "We're Making More Sense Than Ever." 

The ad campaign, created by Saatchi & Saatchi's Backer Spielvogel Bates agency, is an extension of the auto company's "Cars That Make Sense" campaign, which emphasized affordability.
TV ads plugging the company's new V-6 Sonata and its souped-up Excel subcompact will begin appearing Monday. 

One spot shows a Sonata next to a rival midsized car, and an announcer says, "Listen to what they're saying about the Hyundai Sonata." As the announcer reads favorable quotes about the model from Motor Trend and Road & Track magazines, the other car, which is white, slowly turns green. "No wonder the competition's green with envy," the announcer says. 

Ad Notes. . . . 

ACQUISITION: EWDB, formed by the merger of Eurocom and Della Femina McNamee WCRS, said it agreed to buy Vizeversa, an agency in Barcelona.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

HOLIDAY ADS: Seagram will run two interactive ads in December magazines promoting its Chivas Regal and Crown Royal brands.
The Chivas ad illustrates -- via a series of pullouts -- the wild reactions from the pool man, gardener and others if not given Chivas for Christmas.
The three-page Crown Royal ad features a black-and-white shot of a boring holiday party -- and a set of colorful stickers with which readers can dress it up.
Both ads were designed by Omnicom's DDB Needham agency. 

Senate Democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax aren't ready to line up behind the leading Senate proposal. 

Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut, which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year, when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the House. 

Nevertheless, Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking GOP member on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary. 

Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds, perhaps as soon as today.
Mr. Packwood all but conceded defeat, telling Mr. Mitchell: "I sense at this stage you may have the votes." 

The two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion, violating usual Senate decorum.
Their tone was good-natured, with Mr. Packwood saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and Sen. Mitchell saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again. 

Although the proposal, authored by Mr. Packwood and Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), appears to have general backing by Republicans, their votes aren't sufficient to pass it.
And Democrats, who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains-tax cut, are finding reasons to say no, at least for now.
A major reason is that they believe the Packwood-Roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run. 

The Packwood-Roth proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held.
It also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes, including retirement, medical expenses, first-home purchases and tuition. 

"A number of us are not going to touch capital gains, IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction," said Sen. Charles Robb (D., Va.), who is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats who the Bush administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains. 

President Bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with Democratic senators at the White House.
And at a luncheon meeting Tuesday of Democratic senators, there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year, according to participants. 

The trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success. "There is a one-out-of-three shot of getting it this year," said Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, a leading Democratic proponent of cutting the capital-gains tax.
He called the battle "uphill." 

Other Democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic. "There will be no capital-gains bill this year," said Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.). "I'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal.
The IRA portion (of the Packwood-Roth plan) is irresponsible." 

Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Mitchell.
Mr. Mitchell has made clear to his wavering colleagues that the issue is important to him personally. 

Today, Sen. Mitchell and other leading Democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal.
Estimates requested by Sen. Mitchell from the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $13 million each in 1985, the last year for which figures are available. 

White House officials acknowledged yesterday that Democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the Packwood-Roth capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck Sen. Mitchell.
As a result, the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with Senate Democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut. 

Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of "tinkering" with the Packwood-Roth proposal, suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back, one official said. 

In addition, White House aides think that there are numerous other important measures Democrats badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with Democrats.
A capital-gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage.
Other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage. 

If they can't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan, administration officials also aren't ruling out making a deal with Congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future, even next year.
But the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the House and the Senate.

Japanese immigration authorities said they found 658 more Chinese among Vietnamese boat people, bringing the number of Chinese trying to enter Japan by posing as Vietnamese refugees this year to 1,642. 

Japan plans to send the Chinese back home and is negotiating with the Chinese government, a Justice Ministry official said.
The Chinese were among 3,372 boat people supposedly from Vietnam who arrived in Japan this year, compared with 219 for all of 1988, the official said. 

The 658 Chinese, who have been in a refugee-assistance center, were sent to immigration facilities yesterday pending deportation to China, the official said. 

On Sept. 13, Japan began a policy of screening boat people, accepting only those deemed to be political refugees. 

Francoise Verne, 52-year-old former deputy director of France's mint, faces prison for her theft of some 67 rare coins from the mint's collections.
Second in command from 1979 to 1984, Mrs. Verne told a Paris court that the "great disorder" that reigned at the agency led her into temptation.
Before an inventory in 1984 that showed the "disappearance" of 944 coins valued at about 2.9 million French francs (about $465,000), there hadn't been any stock-taking since 1868.
Tony Lambert, Mrs. Verne's successor, says the mint's losses from the theft run into the hundreds of thousands of francs. 

El Salvador is destroying more than 1.6 million pounds of food that had rotted in government warehouses, government officials said.
The state Supply Regulator Institute is to burn rice, corn and beans that spoiled because of neglect and corruption in the previous Christian Democrat government, a statement from the information service SISAL said.
During the past administration the foodstuffs were first bought by the institute, then sold at low prices to "unscrupulous businessmen" who resold them to the institute at inflated prices, the statement said. 

A black-draped cruise liner sailed into Naples yesterday bringing 800 Libyans threatening vengeance if Italy refuses to pay compensation for more than 30 years of colonial rule.
Another 250 Libyans were already in Italy to stage a day of mourning for victims of Italy's colonial rule between 1911 and 1943, when Tripoli says Rome kidnapped 5,000 Libyans and deported them as forced labor.
Libya's revolutionary Committees have threatened attacks on Italians if Rome doesn't pay compensation.
But officials in Rome say the issue was legally resolved by a settlement between Italy and King Idris, deposed by Col. Muammar Gadhafi in 1969. 

Canadian Indians are taking five countries to court in a bid to stop low military flights over their homes, the Dutch Defense Ministry said.
Representatives of the Inuit and Cree peoples living in Quebec and Labrador in northeastern Canada told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting, a ministry spokesman said.
They also wanted to prevent a NATO training base being built in the region, he said.
The action, in the Canadian Federal Court, will be against Canada, the Netherlands, West Germany, Britain and the U.S., the ministry spokesman said. 

Japan suspended imports of French mushrooms after finding some contaminated by radiation, an official of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said.

Since then, the ministry has announced 50 bans on food imports from European countries, including Italy, Spain, Turkey, Greece and the Soviet Union. 

The Venice city council is battling plans to tap huge gas fields off the coast that it says will speed up the city's slow sinking into its lagoon. 

AGIP, the state-owned energy giant, made the announcement about the gas field last month.
Located six miles northeast of Venice, the field contains 875 billion cubic feet of methane gas-one-tenth of Italy's reserves. 

Alarmed councilors say the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop, or slow down, the subsidence that makes Venice subject to regular and destructive flooding.
The council unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has yet to reply. 

AGIP refused to reconsider and says drilling is due to start early next year. "It's unlikely extracting the gas will cause subsidence," says a spokeswoman. 

Thieves stole a 12th century fresco from an abandoned church in Camerino, Italy, by removing the entire wall on which the work had been painted, police said. . . . West Germany's BMW commissioned the Nuremberg post office to test a prototype battery-powered car.
The vehicle has a top speed of 65 miles an hour and requires recharging from a standard wall socket every 100 miles. 

A proposed conflict-of-interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high-technology new ventures, say financiers, researchers and university administrators. 

The National Institutes of Health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses -- or lose their government money.
Among other concerns, the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new drugs.
As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years, governmental fear of abuse has risen. 

But the guidelines could "make it impossible to commercialize research," says Kenneth Smith, associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15.
After that, it will make a final decision on the policy. 

The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc., a Salem, Mass., start-up, says Robert Daly, a managing partner of TA Associates, a venture-capital firm.
With $2.3 million, he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego. 

The researchers, who are being financed by the Lithox funds, will receive a royalty, or percentage of sales, if their research yields a commercial product.
But because the University of California, like many other universities, shares its royalties with researchers, it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines, Mr. Daly says. 

The high-tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect.
For instance, Commonwealth BioVentures Inc., a venture-capital concern, last month invested $600,000 to launch Amira Inc., a Worcester, Mass., concern that will produce pharmaceuticals.
Scientists Rima Kaddurah-Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
While Ms. Kaddurah-Daouk left MIT to head Amira, Prof.
Schimmel will continue to work at MIT, serve on Amira's board and own a small equity stake in the company. 

The Amira transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research.
While universities develop the basic research, "venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization," says Gloria W. Doubleday of Commonwealth. "This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities." 

But the new guidelines could prevent scientists like Prof.
Schimmel from being involved with start-ups such as Amira, venture capitalists point out.
And if that happens, the entire process of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed, they say. 

The stakes in the controversy are large.
Last year, venture capitalists spent an estimated $600 million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses, according to the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group.
Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties. 

In many of these deals, "venture capitalists had the inside track," says Lawrence Bock of Avalon Ventures, La Jolla, Calif.
Investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because "we had exclusive rights to those technologies," he adds. 

But under the proposed guidelines, all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work. "Without the exclusivity, most venture capitalists won't have the incentive to invest in such deals," Mr. Bock says. 

Last year, for example, Avalon and others invested $14 million in Athena Neurosciences Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain.
But before Athena was able to get an exclusive license to the technology, the Federal Register published most of the details, "giving all of the company's potential competitors a chance to exploit it," Mr. Bock says.
Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it.
But, says Mr. Bock, "It was a close call." 

The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce capital, entrepreneurs say.
If start-ups can't have early access to research being conducted at institutions, "we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research," says Ruth Emyanitoff, manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., concern.
Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up, Ms. Emyanitoff says. 

For its part, NIH insists that its guidelines "should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use." Universities such as Harvard and MIT should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists, says Katherine Bick, who oversees the huge NIH grants program as its deputy director for extramural research. 

NIH staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures.
Not long ago, scientists holding stock in Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc. were accused of falsifying research to boost the stock.
Many officials are also concerned about companies getting a "free ride" on government-sponsored research.
A congressional subcommitee has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies exploiting their research. 

Among other provisions, the NIH guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research. 

Ms. Bick, the NIH administrator, says the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be "ideas for discussion." The predictions of doom are "premature," she says. 

But when agencies like the NIH circulate guidelines, they've often already formulated policy, veteran scientists say.
Indeed, institutions already are taking note.
On Sept. 14, Harvard began circulating a conflict-of-interest policy statement that, in effect, would follow the NIH guidelines faithfully. 

The University of California at San Francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business.
In many other institutions, scientists are shunning contacts with venture investors until the NIH policy is settled. 

Says Mr. Daly, the venture capitalist: "It doesn't matter whether they call it guidelines or policy.
The damage is already done." 

Call Jim Wright's office in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, these days and the receptionist still answers the phone, "Speaker Wright's office." 

The former congressman, who resigned as speaker of the House after an investigation of his financial dealings, is ensconced in his district office, maintained by taxpayers on a $200,000 allowance.
He is negotiating a rich book contract to boot. 

One of the hottest tickets on Washington's social calendar this fall was a charity benefit honoring former Congressman Tony Coelho, who landed a million-dollar job on Wall Street after resigning over a controversial junk-bond investment last summer. 

Michael Deaver, the former White House aide, has become the most recent addition to the teeming ranks of fallen politicians and officials earning their way as lobbyists and consultants here.
Mr. Deaver has reopened a public-relations business. 

Surviving scandal has become a rite of political passage at a time when a glut of scandal has blunted this town's sensibility.
Let the president demand strict new ethics rules: With four sitting House members accused of sexual misdeeds, amid the unfolding HUD scandal and after the Wright debacle, "people are slightly dulled by scandal," says political humorist Art Buchwald. "It now takes something really weird to inspire public outrage." 

Not all the scandal-tripped have enjoyed soft landings.
But many have. "These people bounce back more resiliently than regular people," says Washington writer Suzanne Garment, who is working on a history of post-Watergate scandal. 

Given their own penchant for book writing, it is surprising that none of the masters of scandal survival have yet published a guide to the art.
For there is an emerging protocol -- indeed, an etiquette -- to it.
Among the rules: 

Pretend Nothing Happened 

As if he were still in his old job, Mr. Wright, by resigning with his title instead of being forced from his job, by law enjoys a $120,000 annual office expense allowance, three paid staffers, up to $67,000 for stationery and telephones and continued use of the franking privilege.
Not to mention a generous federal pension.
There is also a busy schedule of speaking engagements at $10,000 a pop, at tony places including the Yale Political Union. 

"He's as busy as he was as speaker," reports Mr. Wright's administrative aide, Larry Shannon. 

Atone 

On the edge of fashionable Georgetown, in a chic office with a river view and a number of corporate clients whom he won't name, Mr. Deaver is trying to reclaim his reputation as one of the savviest image makers in town. 

There are few mementos of his days as White House deputy chief of staff and confidant of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.
The former $3 million-a-year lobbyist now frequents shelters for the homeless and devotes a third of his time counseling other recovering alcoholics. "I feel better than I ever have in my life," he says. 

Mr. Deaver confessed to his alcoholism during his trial on perjury charges.
He is also a recovering workaholic, relaxing with his family and creating topiary, or garden-shrub sculpture, a fashionable pursuit for which he developed a passion during his three-year legal ordeal.
One sign of Mr. Deaver's renaissance: an appearance on ABC's "Nightline" for a show on pack journalism.
Host Ted Koppel introduced him as "the media master of the Reagan Administration," with nary a mention of Mr. Deaver's conviction in 1987 on perjury charges. 

Finding God 

"When someone says, 'I've turned to God, ' everybody lays off," observes Frank Mankiewicz, an old Washington hand and former aide to Robert Kennedy.
Thus have Charles Colson and Jeb Magruder launched successful post-Watergate careers at the pulpit. 

But it doesn't always work so smoothly.
After allegations surfaced in a 1985 divorce contest that he had beaten his wife, SEC enforcement chief John Fedders retreated to a Trappist monastery in rural Virginia.
He is now in solo law practice in Washington, but his fees have been meager and he failed in efforts to win a chunk of his ex-wife's royalties on her tell-all book.
From time to time he returns to the monastery for prayer, meditation and pro bono legal work. 

Mr. Fedders is philosophical about his travails. "This whole experience has been an opportunity for internal growth," he says.
He sees a psychoanalyst five mornings a week. "I've surrendered to the circumstances," Mr. Fedders says. "The word surrender has a precise psychoanalytic meaning.
My universe has changed.
I'm enjoying my life and who I am today.
The aspect of being a mega-lawyer isn't as important." 

Don't Linger 

"The best thing you can do is get off the screen," says Mr. Buchwald.
Nobody proved that more masterfully than Mr. Coelho, the former Democratic majority whip.
Declaring that there was life after Congress, he resigned almost immediately after media reports questioned the propriety of a 1986 junk-bond investment, before any official investigations took hold. 

Among the glitterati who turned out in bipartisan black-tie force to benefit the Coelho Epilepsy Fund last month were Sen. Robert Dole, Rep. Newt Gingrich, and other kingpins of Congress.
Dan Rather served as emcee.
From his new, million-dollar-a-year perch on Wall Street as a managing director of Wertheim Schroder & Co., Mr. Coelho reports that many of his former colleagues have contacted him to find out how they, too, can pursue investment banking careers. 

It Helps to Be Male 

Male scandal victims invariably fare better.
Anne Burford, the former EPA chief who resigned under fire in 1983 during a flap with Congress, was kayoed in the confrontation, even though she was never charged with official wrondgoing.
She worked part-time as a consultant and wrote a book, but never restarted her high-powered legal career.
It didn't help when, in 1986, she was charged (and then cleared) on allegations of public drunkenness. 

"I cut my losses and ran," she says, from her new home in Colorado, where she is busy remodeling.
Mrs. Burford remains bitter over the overwhelming legal expenses involved in clearing her name. "My husband was instantly impoverished by the very act of marrying me," she says. 

Another former EPA official, Rita Lavelle, is still struggling after her conviction in 1983 on perjury charges. "There's nothing she could do to bring herself back to where she was," says her lawyer, James Bierbower. "You could say she survived, but it wasn't easy on her." 

No book contracts have been dangled before Deborah Gore Dean, the reigning queen of the HUD scandal.
Donna Rice of Gary Hart fame failed to obtain a book contract and lost her modeling contract for "No Excuses" jeans.
Fawn Hall, Oliver North's former secretary, has yet to launch a hoped-for television news career, according to her lawyer. 

Rita Jenrette, the former wife of Abscam-indicted Rep. John Jenrette, has yet to hit it big in Hollywood, although with roles in such movies as "Zombie Island Massacre" and "Aunt Ida's Bikini Shop," she is doing a lot better than her former husband.
He was back in jail over the summer on shoplifting charges. 

Be the Star 

Central figures -- such as Richard Nixon -- usually fare better than those with supporting roles.
Richard Secord, the retired Air Force general felled in the Iran-Contra scandal, is all but ruined -- forced to sell his Virginia home and pull his kids out of college, according to a recent fund-raising appeal sent out on his behalf.
Yet his co-defendant in the case -- also a former military officer by the name of Oliver North -- has been busily and profitably burnishing his involvement in the affair. 

What accounts for the difference?
During the televised Iran-Contra hearings, Mr. North came off as a patriot from central casting.
Mr. Secord's performance was decidedly less inspiring. 

Mr. North remains in heavy demand as a speaker, for fees reported in the $20,000 range.
Even in the wake of Hurricane Hugo 750 people turned out in a remote Virginia town in September for a "family tribute" to Mr. North given by two dozen conservative members of Congress. 

If Sex Is Involved, All Bets Are Off 

Sex scandals make people look careless and silly, and one of the worst sins in Washington is to be laughed at. "You can be wicked, but not foolish," says Mr. Mankiewicz. 

Nevertheless, Rep. Gerry Studds of Massachusetts was handily re-elected because of the candor with which he handled revelations that he had sex with a male congressional page in 1983. 

Former Rep. Robert Bauman, a Maryland Republican who lost his seat in 1980 after he was caught soliciting sex from a 16-year-old boy, has never regained his professional footing as a lawyer.
Mr. Bauman, a conservative, says he was deserted by the right wing. "Conservatives shoot their own," he says. 

If the political establishment is reluctant to forgive sexual misadventures, the private sector sometimes will.
John Tower was accused of womanizing and boozing during his unsuccessful bid to win confirmation as secretary of defense earlier this year.
Now he is writing a book, serving on an elite foreign policy advisory board and consulting for an array of corporate clients, including British publishing mogul Robert Maxwell. 

Become a Lobbyist 

When all else fails, Gucci Gulch -- the fabled halls of the Capitol inhabited by lobbyists and their imported shoes -- offers a welcome environment for fallen officials.
Former Rep. Fernand St Germain, brought down by the savings-and-loan crisis, now represents -- you guessed it -- savings-and-loans associations. 

Some become pseudo-lobbyists.
John Mack promptly quit his job last spring as an aide to Speaker Wright amid public outrage over Mr. Mack's violent attack on a young woman when he was 19 years old.
After a few weeks in seclusion, Mr. Mack opened a consulting firm, but not to enable him to directly lobby; that would require him to disclose his clients by registering as a lobbyist.
Still, Mr. Mack says he talks to "30 members of Congress a week." Misery Loves Company 

Other scandal survivors are sometimes the best source of solace.
Raymond Donovan, the New Jersey construction executive who was forced to resign as labor secretary and indicted in 1985, only to be acquitted of fraud charges, often calls other scandal-tossed public figures to offer a sympathetic ear.
Each time a new scandal hits, he says, "it pulls the scabs off your knees." 

One of the first people to come to the Deaver home after his troubles erupted was former Nixon aide John Ehrlichman, whom Mr. Deaver scarcely knew. "He reassured me that the hurricane would end," Mr. Deaver recalls. 

Mr. Bauman received an encouraging letter from the recognized master of scandal survival, Richard Nixon.
Says Mr. Bauman: "If things get really tough, I can always auction it off at Sotheby's." 

Merksamer Jewelers Inc., a fast-growing jewelry store chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain. 

The filing, made yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, follows an agreement by L.J. Hooker Corp., Merksamer's owner, to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price.
GE Capital Corp., a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co., is providing Merksamer management with $15 million in financing. 

L.J. Hooker, based in Atlanta, filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention to sell its B. Altman & Co. department store chain.
L.J. Hooker is owned by Hooker Corp., Sydney, Australia, which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator. 

L.J. Hooker's planned sale of Merksamer is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 

Rumors to the effect that the Merksamer chain would file for Chapter 11 arose last week in the jewelry industry.
At that time, Sam Merksamer, president of the chain, angrily denied that his company was about to file.
Mr. Merksamer is leading the buy-out. 

According to executives close to the situation, Merksamer filed for Chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain.
One executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of L.J. Hooker Corp. had frozen in place all of L.J. Hooker's assets. 

The Merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement. "By filing for Chapter 11, the Merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale, not the hundreds of unsecured creditors," said this executive. "The cash from the sale will go to L.J. Hooker, but the company itself will belong to Sam Merksamer." 

Mr. Merksamer and Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker, were unavailable for comment.
In a statement, Mr. Merksamer described the filing as a "legal technicality," but also said that "our inability to obtain trade credit, combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for the Christmas season, necessitated our filing Chapter 11." 

The jewelry chain, which is based in Sacramento, Calif., had revenue of $62 million and operating profit of $2.5 million for the year ended June 30. 

Financial markets took a midweek break from their recent wild gyrations with stock prices falling modestly, bond prices posting tiny gains and the dollar almost unchanged. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 5.94 points to 2653.28 in moderate trading.
Long-term Treasury bonds rose slightly despite the arrival on the market of $4.52 billion in 30-year bonds offered by the Resolution Funding Corp. as part of the government's bailout of the savings and loan industry.
The dollar was barely changed against the West German mark and up marginally against the Japanese yen. 

Yesterday's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the rearing and plunging of stock prices Tuesday after the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. once again collapsed.
Traders said the stock market's lurching moves have prompted many investors to head for the sidelines until it regains some semblance of stability. 

Although bond prices weren't as volatile on Tuesday trading as stock prices, traders nevertheless said action also was much slower yesterday in the Treasury market.
Bond investors paid close attention to comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was testifying before a congressional hearing, but weren't able to extract many clues about the future course of the Fed's monetary policy.
Many analysts are expecting the Fed to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year. 

Investors now are awaiting today's release of the preliminary estimate of third-quarter gross national product.
Economists predict the report will show economic growth of about 2.5% in the third quarter, which would have little effect on financial markets.
But an unexpected deviation either way could roil bond and currency markets. 

In major market activity: 

Stock prices slipped lower in moderate trading.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 155.7 million shares.
But advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 784 to 700. 

Bond prices inched higher.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue rose less than an eighth of a point, or less than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount.
The yield on the issue stood at 7.88%. 

The dollar was virtually unchanged.
In late New York trading the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen, compared with 1.8355 marks and 141.45 yen Tuesday. 

In a corner of the cavernous, new Nippon Convention Center sits Mazda Motor Corp. 's advanced-technology display.
The highlight: a "fragrance control system." 

With the touch of a button, drivers can choose from lavender, jasmine, mint or perfume scents, all blown in through the car's air-conditioning system.
The soft, wafting aromas will "improve ride comfort," the display attests, and a proud employee says Mazda hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two. 

Welcome to the 28th Tokyo Motor Show.
Here you can find Mitsubishi Motors Corp. displaying a "live fish transporter," a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels, and Nissan Motor Co. with its "keyless" Boga, whose doors unlock upon recognizing the owner's fingerprints.
Suzuki Motor Co. 's Escudome sport vehicle features a pop-out rear tent and invites drivers to go "back to the nature." 

But this biennial event, the world's largest display of cars and trucks, has its serious side, including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle-suspension systems.
It's also the prime showcase for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged, and therein lies the draw. 

Even the biggest auto shows in the U.S. are largely regional affairs, but the Tokyo show is international.
Virtually every automotive analyst in New York showed up.
Detroit-to-Tokyo flights were booked solid this week as Motor City executives, including Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E. Petersen and Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, flocked to see the future.
Even the Soviet Union came, for the first time in 24 years, to show off its Lada Niva sedan and its futuristic dark-blue "Kompakt" model. 

Here's a firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported, and what the foreign visitors saw. 

New Technology 

The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps, potholes and other rigors of the road.
These "active suspension systems" electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car's ride.
Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces, but active suspension provides power to counter the jolts. 

Nissan, in a 34-page tract, modestly compares its "hydraulic active suspension" to a cheetah, and equates the various parts to the animal's heart, brain, nerves and blood vessels.
Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension's inner workings. 

Nissan says it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan, and Toyota's Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring.
But drivers in the U.S. must wait: The Japanese, for now, are keeping active suspension for domestic use only.
And Detroit's Big Three auto makers say their systems are still under development. 

In the engine department, several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today's engines and yet take up only half the space, allowing for shorter hoods.
In the so-called two-stroke engines, which are expected to get sharply higher gas mileage, each piston goes up and down only once to provide power.
By contrast, the pistons in conventional four-stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle. 

The two-stroke engine displays by Toyota and Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, drew plenty of interest from U.S. auto executives, who are rushing to develop two-stroke engines. 

Honda Motor Co. shows a more conventional five-cylinder engine in the new Accord Inspire model, which made its debut just this month -- in Japan only.
Honda says the five-cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel-economy of a four-cylinder, and the power of a V-6.
It is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury Acura line in the U.S., but Honda officials wouldn't comment. 

Odd Cars, Funny Names 

There's plenty of whimsy here, but it isn't always clear whether it's intentional.
The show's symbol is a woman riding on a snail, not your usual metaphor for speed and agility.
But the sponsors have an explanation: "Through the character associated with a snail," they say, "important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought." 

Japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names, but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high -- or low.
Honda has a tiny motorcycle called the Monkey, and a slightly larger cousin, the Gorilla.
Mitsubishi has a futuristic delivery truck called the Guppy.
Mazda has the Bongo truck and, under its Autozam nameplate, a "microvan" called the Scrum.
Its buglike Carol minicar is "designed with softness, gentleness and warmheartedness." 

But the court jester appears to be Japan's smallest car maker, Daihatsu Motor Co.
One of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike Sneaker, which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear.
Daihatsu also has the Fellow 90, the Leeza Spider and the Hijet Dumbo. 

The jokes aren't just on the Japanese, though.
Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, the French auto maker, has a concept car called the Megane.
The name is supposed to connote feminine grandeur, but in Japanese it means "eyeglasses." 

Foreign Presence 

Foreign auto makers are taking the Tokyo Motor Show more seriously than ever.
AB Volvo invites passers-by to play "the role of the test dummy" by hopping in a car that simulates a crash to show just how its seat-belt tightener works.
Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea has its first-ever exhibit in Tokyo. 

General Motors Corp. is sponsoring its first independent display in 10 years, and it includes a boxy Buick station wagon with wood-grain side panels.
Ford and Chrysler also have exhibits, although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less-popular automotive parts section. 

"We've got to get out of the Detroit mentality and be part of the world mentality," declares Charles M. Jordan, GM's vice president for design, in explaining his pilgrimage to the Tokyo Show. 

Even so, traditional American cockiness isn't terribly endangered.
Ford officials, for example, crowed about their first-ever Tokyo Grand Prix racing victory.
True, Ford was declared the winner Sunday, but only after the Honda driver who crossed the finish line first was disqualified because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds. 

Mr. Jordan of GM, meanwhile, still criticizes Japanese styling. "It's hard for the Japanese," he says, "to get a feeling in a car, to get a passion in a car, to get emotion in a car." 

Wilson H. Taylor, president and chief executive officer of this insurance and financial services concern, was elected to the additional post of chairman.
Mr. Taylor, 45 years old, succeeds Robert D. Kilpatrick, 64, who is retiring, as reported earlier.
Mr. Kilpatrick will remain a director. 

Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, paid Massachusetts $9.1 million in taxes, bringing to an end a 10-month-long corporate tax chase. 

Officials at the Department of Revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court.
But "the check arrived in the mail," said Stephen Kidder, Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue. 

Mercedes-Benz, which had said it didn't owe taxes to Massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a dock in Baltimore and not in Massachusetts, didn't explain its change of heart. 

Last month, Mercedes-Benz executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press, the commissioner said.
The dispute was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in August. 

The amount covers taxes, interest and penalties owed from 1966, when the state began collecting corporate taxes, to 1985.
Mercedes-Benz also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years 1986 through 1988, Mr. Kidder added. 

Under Massachusetts tax laws, corporations must pay 9.5% of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities, including warranties, customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships. 

(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

TAX SHELTERS CALLED Individual Retirement Accounts, or "IRAs," were created without fanfare on Sept. 2, 1974, but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving. 

That Labor Day, in his first major act after succeeding the resigned Richard Nixon as president, Gerald R. Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
Pension reform was its main thrust.
Labor and business leaders, quoted at the White House Rose Garden rites, hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits.
IRAs were like stepchildren there. 

The IRA's conception is murky.
In 1972, then Treasury Secretary George Shultz, with the key support of Sen. Carl Curtis, sought some form of pensions for the uncovered.
That year a four-man group headed by William Lieber in the Legislation and Regulations division of the Office of the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service, was assigned the task of designing a plan. 

They used the 1962 Keogh Plan, a pension plan created by a New York congressman for the self-employed, as a partial model.
This team initially called its new model Personal Retirement Account, or "PRA." But it didn't sing.
So they opted for IRA, naming it after Ira Cohen, a brilliant IRS actuary who helped them.
Ira, himself, confirms this account. 

IRA rules have been changed over the years.
One in 1981 raised to $2,000 a year from $1,500 the amount a person could put, tax-deductible, into the tax-deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans.
This caused an explosion of IRA promotions by brokers, banks, mutual funds and others.
But in 1986 Congress sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and IRA tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth. 

IRA account assets have grown to about $400 billion from $393 billion last year and just $26 billion in 1981. 

Eugene A. Miller, 52 years old, was elected a director of this electric utility company, filling a vacancy.
He is president and chief executive officer of Comerica Inc. in Detroit. 

Marsh & McLennan Cos. said it agreed to acquire the rest of Gradmann & Holler, a leading West German insurance brokerage firm in which it has held a 15% stake for 15 years. 

The transaction, for cash and stock, would represent the biggest European takeover since 1980 for New York-based Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker.
It's also the first major sign of the long-awaited consolidation in the European insurance industry as the European Community Commission moves toward a single market by 1992. 

Protective barriers will start coming down within the insurance industry next summer, when big industrial companies will be able to buy insurance from carriers in any other EC country for the first time.
That's why "we have been working hard to develop a single, more unified presence in Europe," said A.J.C. Smith, Marsh & McLennan's president, at a London news conference yesterday. 

Analysts speculated that Marsh & McLennan would spend between 250 million marks ($136.4 million) and 350 million marks for the rest of Gradmann & Holler, or roughly 25 to 30 times the private firm's estimated earnings. "This is paying a big price to maintain their virility as the world's leading insurance broker," said Philip Olsen, an analyst at Kitcat & Aitken, a U.K. brokerage firm. 

Earlier this year, New York Life Insurance Co. agreed to acquire Windsor Group Ltd., a first step toward establishing a presence in the European market ahead of 1992.
But most U.S. insurers haven't rushed to change the way they do business in Europe because they believe the European market will still be dominated by a handful of domestic companies. 

Under the proposed combination, Marsh & McLennan would gain a majority stake in Gradmann & Holler that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining 85%.
The three managing general partners would receive a "significant" number of Marsh & McLennan shares, said Walther L. Kiep, a partner who would also join Marsh & McLennan's board. 

Mr. Kiep said he sought the combination because "all our large clients in Germany are becoming European companies or multinational companies and they expect an insurance broker" to serve them as well in Paris as in Germany.

Many small investors are facing a double whammy this year: They got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market, and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money. 

These people invested in "leveraged" junk bond mutual funds, the publicly traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk. 

It's a good strategy in a rising market, where a 25% leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have 125% of their money working for them.
The strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio. 

Trouble is, junk bond prices have been weak for months.
Thus, the leverage has amplified the funds' portfolio losses.
And shares of leveraged junk funds this year have been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds they hold. 

"That's really where the leverage hurt," says Thomas Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment manager who specializes in closed-end funds. "Share prices performed even worse than the funds' asset values because fear has taken hold" in the junk market, he says. 

Leverage is never a problem for the traditional "open end" mutual funds, which aren't publicly traded and aren't allowed to use leverage at all.
Leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds. 

The usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock, using the proceeds to buy additional bonds.
The fallout for investors lately has been painful. 

Consider the New America High Income Fund.
With a leveraged position of about 45%, the fund's share price has plunged 28.5% so far this year.
That's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio, whose total return (bond-price changes plus interest) has amounted to a negative 6.08%. 

Such problems may not be over.
Leveraged funds in particular "are still extremely vulnerable, because we're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market," says George Foot, a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates in Northampton, Mass. 

Many investors are unaware their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market. "If someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold," says Gerald Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago, they might shy away. 

In a typical leverage strategy, a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money.
If the market surges, holders can make that much more profit; the leverage effectively acts as an interest-free margin account for investors. 

But when the market moves against the fund, investors lose more than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified by the amount the fund is leveraged. 

Fund managers, for their part, defend their use of leverage.
Carl Ericson, who runs the Colonial Intermediate High Income Fund, says the fund's 25% leverage has jacked up its interest income. "As long as I am borrowing at 9.9% and each {bond} yields over that, it enhances the yield," he maintains.
Mr. Ericson says he tries to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund's portfolio. 

Yet some funds have pulled in their horns.
New America High Income Fund recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $5 million in preferred stock and notes from investors.
The fund made a similar move earlier this year. 

"We are trying to increase our flexibility," says Ellen E. Terry, a vice president at Ostrander Capital Management, the fund's investment adviser.
She declined to elaborate and wouldn't disclose the fund's recent purchases, sales or cash position. 

Ms. Terry did say the fund's recent performance "illustrates what happens in a leveraged product" when the market doesn't cooperate. "When the market turns around," she says, "it will give a nice picture" of how leverage can help performance. 

Several leveraged funds don't want to cut the amount they borrow because it would slash the income they pay shareholders, fund officials said.
But a few funds have taken other defensive steps.
Some have raised their cash positions to record levels.
High cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls. 

Prospect Street High Income Portfolio, for instance, now holds about 15% in cash and equivalents, nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year, says John Frabotta, portfolio co-manager.
He says the fund, which is 40% leveraged, has maintained a "substantial cushion" between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio's bonds. "I don't want to be in a position to have to sell," Mr. Frabotta says. 

Other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash.
At the 50%-leveraged Zenith Income Fund, portfolio manager John Bianchi recently dumped Mesa Petroleum, Wickes and Horsehead Industries, among others, to raise his cash position to a record 15%. 

"That's a problem because cash isn't earning us very much money," Mr. Bianchi says.
He concedes: "This is the most difficult market that I've been involved in." 

Because of the recent junk-market turmoil, the fund is considering investing in other issues instead, including mortgage-backed bonds. 

"We're looking at the leverage factor every day," says Robert Moore, president of Bernstein-Macaulay Inc., a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit and the fund's adviser. "At some point, if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost -- and at the moment we're right on it -- we're going to have to make a move." 

Dominion Textile Inc. holders adopted a shareholder-rights plan at the annual meeting. 

The so-called poison pill took effect Aug. 9 pending ratification by holders.
Rights attached to the company's common shares were issued that are triggered if a hostile bidder acquires more than 20% of the shares outstanding.
Once triggered, the rights allow holders to buy additional shares at 50% of the then current market price or, at the board's discretion, to receive securities or assets. 

Separately, Dominion Textile posted net income of 4.7 million Canadian dollars ($4 million), or 12 Canadian cents a share, for the fiscal-first quarter ended Sept. 30.
The company had a net loss of C$2.3 million, or 14 Canadian cents a share, a year ago.
Sales were C$348.2 million compared with C$307.2 a year earlier.

ALAMCO Inc. said its board has approved a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.
The Clarksburg, W.Va., producer of gas and oil, said it wants shareholders to approve the split because it would "enhance the marketability" and trading of the stock.
If approved at a shareholder meeting in December, the number of shares outstanding would decrease to five million from 50 million, and par value would rise to 10 cents from a penny. 

Cineplex Odeon Corp. directors said the company's chairman and chief executive, Garth Drabinsky, is considering bidding 780.6 million Canadian dollars (US$666 million) to acquire the company. 

The board said Mr. Drabinsky and Vice Chairman Myron Gottlieb are negotiating financing before offering C$16.40 a share to acquire all of Cineplex's shares outstanding.
The directors added that the two executives haven't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders. 

The directors said if Messrs.
Drabinsky and Gottlieb mail an offer to shareholders by Nov. 22, it will reimburse them a maximum of C$8.5 million for expenses related to a bid. 

"We consider that his bid is an acceptable bid," said Sandra Kolber, spokeswoman for the independent directors' committee appointed last May to solicit and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between Mr. Drabinsky and Cineplex's major shareholder, MCA Inc. 

MCA and Cineplex's other major shareholder, Montreal-based financier Charles Bronfman and his associates, have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by Mr. Drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder.
MCA holds half of Cineplex's equity and 33% of its voting rights through restricted voting shares, while Bronfman interests hold about 24% of the company's equity. 

Ms. Kolber said the committee had received other bids.
She declined to identify other bidders but said Mr. Drabinsky's offer "is all cash, and it's for all of the company." Several Cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only part of the company. 

"All this has really established is that MCA and the Bronfmans have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out," said Jeffery Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon in Los Angeles. "If a bid materializes at that price, shareholders will have every reason to be glad, but the question of financing still remains." 

Last April, Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30.2% of Cineplex for C$17.50 a share from Bronfman associates.
Mr. Drabinsky, who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years, said the purchase, subsequently rejected by regulators, was aimed at consolidating his control of the company.
MCA strongly opposed the Drabinsky group's move. 

The directors didn't indicate the source of financing for Mr. Drabinsky's new proposal, but said MCA and the Bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $57 million and then lease back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City, Calif., if Mr. Drabinsky succeeds in an offer. 

"This is being done at the suggestion of {Mr.
Drabinsky} and to accommodate him, to facilitate his financing arrangements," Ms. Kolber said. 

In addition, the directors said if a bid by Mr. Drabinsky is successful, Cineplex expects Rank Organisation PLC to acquire the 51% of Cineplex's Film House unit it doesn't own, and provide Mr. Drabinsky with additional loan financing. 

Michael Gifford, Rank's chief executive, said the British theater chain's total involvement "wouldn't exceed $100 million" but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed Film House purchase. 

Cineplex shareholders responded coolly to yesterday's announcement.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed at $11, down 25 cents, with more than a million shares changing hands.
On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed at C$12.875, off 37.5 Canadian cents, well below the C$16.40 level. 

"Where's the bid?" asked Pierre Panet-Raymond, an analyst and broker with Toronto securities dealer McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd. Mr. Panet-Raymond said he doesn't think Messrs.
Drabinsky and Gottlieb are "anywhere close" to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again. 

Mr. Drabinsky couldn't be reached for comment. 

In the bidding war for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, United Illuminating Co. raised its proposed offer to one it valued at $2.29 billion from $2.19 billion, apparently topping all other bidders. 

The bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court supervising PS of New Hampshire's reorganization.
They are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of New Hampshire, where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization. 

Each of the four parties bidding for PS of New Hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state. 

The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for Judge James Yacos, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, because the company's stockholders, unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans.
In addition, some of the proposals are so close, that non-financial issues such as timing may play a more important role. 

The unsecured creditors agreed in principle to support New Haven, Conn.-based United Illuminating's new bid.
They previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by PS of New Hampshire. 

All of the bidders contemplate full payment including interest to secured creditors.
United Illuminating's plan, however, offers more for unsecured creditors. 

Geoffrey Kalmus, counsel to the official creditors committee, said that under the United Illuminating plan, unsecured creditors would be paid in full credits and interest of about $855 million, accrued before PS of New Hampshire's Jan. 1988 filing for bankruptcy court protection.
In addition, they would receive some $200 million in payments for interest since then.
Mr. Kalmus said that by next July they would have accrued unpaid interest equal to $350 million.
Other plans generally wouldn't pay unsecured creditors' interest accrued since the filing. 

Under United Illuminating's plan, a new holding company would be formed to own the two companies.
It would be 72%-owned by United Illuminating holders and 28%-owned by current holders of PS of New Hampshire preferred and common stock.
PS of New Hampshire preferred holders also would get certain debentures and preferred stock.
United Illuminating said the preferred holders total package would equal about 60% of their claims.
Common shareholders would end up owning about 6.4% of the combined company. 

As previously reported, Northeast Utilities, Hartford, Conn., Monday filed a bid it valued at $2.25 billion.
That offer was endorsed by the shareholders committee. 

The other bidders, New England Electric System, Westboro, Mass., and PS of New Hampshire, didn't change the value of their bids, although PS of New Hampshire changed its rate proposal.
New England Electric values its offer at $2 billion and PS of New Hampshire values its reorganization plan at $2.2 billion. 

The bankruptcy judge has ruled that federal bankruptcy laws could be used to circumvent state regulation.
However, creditors and bidders alike concede that the state plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it didn't like. 

The state has endorsed the New England Electric plan, which promises to limit rate increases to 4.8% annually for seven years.
Northeast Utilities' plan proposes 5.5% annual increases. 

PS of New Hampshire amended its plan to call for two years of 5.5% rate increases followed by five years of 4.5% increases.
Fuel cost adjustments could change the effective rate increases, however.
Previously it had proposed seven years of 5.5% increases. 

United Illuminating also amended its rate plan.
The new offer assumes just five years of 5.5% rate increases, to be followed by state-approved increases under the usual hearing procedure.
Previously United Illuminating had also called for seven years of 5.5% increases. 

The bids and rate proposals generally assume the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which is completed, will go into operation.
Most of the plans have reduced bids in case the plant fails to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 

In New York Stock Exchange trading, PS of New Hampshire's 17 1/2 debenture due 2004 closed yesterday at $82.50, up $2.
The utility's stock closed at $4 a share, up 37.5 cents, in composite trading on the Big Board. 

In a separate development, PS of New Hampshire gave 60 managers severance agreements that would pay one to three years' salary if their jobs were changed or they were dismissed in the wake of a takeover.
It said the maximum cost of the plan would be $9.7 million. 

Legal controversies in America have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case.
They speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment. 

It has always been so.
In the 1920s, a young schoolteacher, John T. Scopes, volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature.
The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the "smart set," whose spokesman was H.L. Mencken, and the religious fundamentalists, whom Mencken derided as benighted primitives.
Few now recall the actual outcome: Scopes was convicted and fined $100, and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under Tennessee law. 

So it was with the Hiss case a generation later, when Alger Hiss became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the Cold War and conflicting attitudes toward the New Deal he had served.
His trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather banal secrets he allegedly had passed to Soviet intelligence. 

And so it seems to be with the case of Elizabeth Morgan, the Washington, D.C., plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter.
Dr. Morgan has just emerged from the D.C. jail after more than two years' confinement for contempt of court, a heroine to her many supporters. 

To the rest of us, the case is a puzzle.
It is what lawyers call "fact intensive." It presents no great issue of legal principle, no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt.
Instead, it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of "who did what to whom." It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy.
Certainly I do not. 

So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has exerted over the minds of many, not just in Washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world.
I suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of Dr. Morgan. 

The first is that it represents an intense battle in what James Thurber used to caricature as "the war between the sexes." But although Thurber did so gently and lightheartedly, many of Dr. Morgan's supporters have taken Thurber's memorable title "The Male Animal" quite literally.
The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that Thurber accepted as an eternal part of the human condition. 

A second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the Morgan case.
Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the "best" schools.
As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan, does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated, black, working-class woman, Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her?
Or that the president would have hurried to sign the bill "out of compassion for her plight"?
To ask those questions is to answer them. 

Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government.
The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons, and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts as other people in the area do.
Bashing the D.C. government is risk-free for members of Congress, who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it. 

Congress is paralyzed from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit.
Yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed Congress with almost unimaginable speed, before the judicial process had run its course, and, indeed, while the Morgan case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court. 

The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan's particular situation.
It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence.

Western European leaders who favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their arsenal: the dizzying political changes under way in Eastern Europe. 

French President Francois Mitterrand, European Community Commission President Jacques Delors, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the East to the need to speed up changes in the West.
They are stressing that the best way for the West to help the East is to move faster towards Western European economic and monetary unity.
This would make the market-oriented system more attractive to Eastern countries, they argue, and allow greater economic aid and technological know-how to flow from West to East. 

"The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the East," Mr. Mitterrand told the European Parliament in Strasbourg yesterday, "is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the European Community." Mr. Mitterrand proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the EC allowing a European central bank, and that the treaty be ratified by 1992.
Mr. Mitterrand also proposed a separate "Bank for Europe" that would channel development money to the East. 

One basis for linking change in the East and change in the West is the notion that integrating 110 million Eastern Europeans with 320 million Western Europeans is primarily the task of Europeans, despite the U.S.'s obvious strategic and economic interest.
Says a European strategist: "The U.S. tends to look at Eastern Europe {not including the Soviet Union} as Europe looks at Latin America: important but far away.
But for us in Western Europe, these are Europeans next door." 

A reintegrated Europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies.
There is likely to be a natural division of labor, says Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union, and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East. 

The designation at July's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step.
In part, this division is dictated by economics: West Germany is a net exporter of capital while the U.S. isn't.
While American aid efforts have been limited by budget problems, yesterday France announced a three-year, four billion French franc ($650 million) aid plan for Poland. 

Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation, some Western European leaders, especially British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, remain skeptical about European political and economic unity, and are unlikely to let East-West concerns change their minds.
But British analysts are beginning to link the issues. 

"We need a Western Ostpolitik," says John Roper, of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, referring to West Germany's longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the East. "For Poland and Hungary we need to think about a stick-and-carrot economic approach that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers." He notes that the Marshall Plan of U.S. aid to Europe "didn't just throw money at post-war Europe, it also liberalized and opened up those markets." 

The French analysis goes further. "Most of the West's leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika {Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of economic restructuring} to succeed," says Hubert Vedrine, security adviser to Mr. Mitterrand. "But they haven't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions." 

He adds that with communism collapsing and Mr. Gorbachev scrambling to rejuvenate the Soviet economy, "Our interest lies in a controlled transformation, a contained nuclear reaction, so we need to help him, and not just with words." Managing change, he adds, will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the EC, especially in dealing with the question of German reunification. 

Thierry de Montbrial, director of the French Institutue for International Relations in Paris, says it isn't clear what, exactly, West Germany wants.
Any push for a Gorbachev vision of a "common European home," implying the eventual dissolution of the EC, a Soviet-German partnership and the withdrawal of U.S. forces, "would be a very, very serious problem," he says.
He doubts a Bismarckian super state will emerge that would dominate Europe, but warns of "a risk of profound change in the heart of the European Community from a Germany that is too strong, even if democratic." 

He adds: "We, and the rest of the EC have to talk to the Germans, now, frankly and raise these future risks with them." 

While many commentators, particularly French ones, worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the East might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized Europe or the speeded-up withdrawal of American troops, Mr. Roper in London sees a more positive scenario. "There seems to be a message from Moscow there's a deal on offer," he says. "They want reassurance we won't try to undermine or destroy the Warsaw Pact. . . . In return, the U.K. and France could keep their nuclear weapons.
He adds: "Once both sides feel comfortable, it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the East." 

Parker Hannifin Corp. said it agreed to sell its three automotive parts divisions to a management-led investor group for $80 million. 

The buy-out group is headed by Paul R. Lederer, president of Parker's automotive group, and includes several other executives of the three divisions. 

The units are the Edelmann, Ideal and Plews divisions.
Net sales for the units for the fiscal year ended June 30 were $135.6 million. 

Parker officials said the company is selling the units to focus on its other businesses. 

Ohbayashi Corp. agreed to buy E.W. Howell Co., the U.S. subsidiary of Selmer-Sande AS, of Norway, for about $7 million. 

Howell, a Port Washington, N.Y., construction concern, was established in 1891.
It has three U.S. branches. 

Ohbayashi officials said the purchase was undertaken to participate in ventures in and around New York City.
They said Howell is particularly successful there because of its membership cooperation with local unions. 

Ohbayashi is Japan's second largest construction company.
Until now, its inability to form membership ties with organized labor has kept it from penetrating the lucrative New York metropolitan area construction market. 

The company also hopes the latest acquisition will help secure large construction orders from Japanese concerns with U.S. operations. 

Ohbayashi cited industry publications crediting Howell, currently capitalized at $2.2 million, with receiving orders valued at $225 million in 1988. 

The Japanese company received orders totaling 12.44 billion yen ($87.9 million) from its U.S. business activities during the fiscal year ended in March. 

Hale Milgrim, 41 years old, senior vice president, marketing at Elecktra Entertainment Inc., was named president of Capitol Records Inc., a unit of this entertainment concern.
Mr. Milgrim succeeds David Berman, who resigned last month. 

Regarding your Sept. 28 Politics & Policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding IRAs: Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process? 

The Republicans maintain that a 30% capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment, while the Democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings. 

This is a classic example of the old saying, "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts." It's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $50,000 to pay the same 28% incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of $250,000.
The 33% bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level, not just the 5% rate adjustment amount.
It's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement-savings tax incentive.

HEALTH CLUBS gear up for a graying clientele. 

Although their ads picture curvy young people in skimpy outfits, club owners know the future lies with the lumpier over-40 set. "It's a misconception that physical fitness is something for the young and middle-aged," says Michael Pacholik, sales manager of the LA Fitness club, Diamond Bar, Calif.
About 10% to 15% of members at Atlanta's Holiday Espre Center are elderly, says Gerald Williams, fitness consultant. "Most want cardiovascular conditioning . . . the No. 1 way of reducing risk of heart disease." 

The Association of Quality Clubs, which puts 1988 industry revenue at $5 billion, surveyed the health-conscious over-40 market and found that 43% exercise regularly.
Michael Hays, head of ProBody Fitness, notes an industry "wash" is in progress. "Clubs need to be run like restaurants where every square foot makes a dollar," he says.
Older people help profits by filling in "downtime." He adds: "The medical market and the fitness market parallel each other and are going to cross real soon." 

People on fixed incomes get a break at Espre; over 55 wins a 45% discount at Anaheim Imperial Health Spa. 

"HOT" TOPAZ sparks regulator, jeweler concern over import of irradiated stones. 

A committee of gem dealers investigates the source of some "hot" blue topaz stones recently reported by a Hong Kong jewelry manufacturer.
In the U.S., radiation limits are set and monitored by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses reactors that process the topaz.
The agency is working on licensing importers but doesn't currently monitor imports.
Topaz, a translucent mineral that is often whitish when taken from the ground, can be turned blue by irradiation, which transforms it into a gemstone that looks like an aquamarine. 

"The {stones} that were irradiated in the U.S. are safe," says John Hickey, chief of the NRC operations branch, Washington. "We believe that the vast majority of imported material is safe.
But there is a small risk that some were imported with high radiation levels." Mr. Hickey added that the stones found in Hong Kong are thought to carry double the U.S. radiation limit, although he noted that double or even triple the U.S. limit is "still in the range of safe levels." Some jewelers have Geiger counters to measure topaz radiation. 

CAPITAL TRAVELS to Europe as 1992 unification nears. 

Boston's Advent International raises $230 million from U.S. pension funds and other institutions to invest in Europe.
Other venture capitalists are already there: MMG Patricof Group and its Alan Patricof Associates, New York; Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co., Boston; and San Francisco's Hambrecht & Quist have about $800 million to invest in European companies. 

European venture capital funds total about $14 billion and are expected to continue growing 35% annually.
Continentals believe that the strongest growth area will be southern Europe.
Spain and Italy are most often mentioned as the future economic hot spots.
Favored ventures include media, telecommunications and retailing.
Most popular acquisition method: the leveraged buy-out. 

Family-owned firms that need cash to grow are attractive, says John Turner of Matuschka Gruppe, Munich.

RADIO MALAISE draws the ear of the Federal Communications Commission. 

AM radio, which has been losing listeners to FM channels since the 1970s, approaches the 1990s with a diminished voice.
But it may have a good listener in Washington.
The FCC plans to hear a day of testimony Nov. 16 on the plight of AM radio.
The commission believes that improving AM service would broaden listening selections and increase options for advertisers.
The issues are also thought to be important to the FCC's new chairman, Alfred Sikes, a former AM broadcaster in his native Missouri. 

The FM radio band, considered technically superior because it can carry stereo broadcasts, has cornered the airwaves for delivering music.
AM stereo remains largely undeveloped because it lacks a uniform delivery system.
The National Association of Broadcasters in June adopted an agenda for revitalizing AM radio that includes, among other things, pursuing further FCC action on selecting an AM stereo standard and seeking a law requiring all stereo receivers to include AM stereo. 

Listeners turned to radios run on batteries for news when the San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo cut power lines. 

BRIEFS: A Modern Healthcare magazine article says 40% of surveyed executives admitted falling asleep during formal presentations. . . . Lee Co., the jeans maker, celebrates its 100th anniversary with a hardcover yearbook featuring photos of its 10,000 employees. 

Adolph Coors Co. said its Coors Brewing Co. unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the West beginning early next year. 

The move, which was expected, marks the first time since Prohibition that Coors has sold a non-alcoholic beverage, and marks the company's entry into a crowded, but fast-growing market that generated about $2.2 billion in sales last year. 

Coors is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide.
Perrier, sold by Perrier Group of America, a unit of Source Perrier S.A. of Paris, and Evian, sold by a U.S. unit BSN of France, are distributed to urban areas nationally, but are less available in rural communities.
Coors, with its large beer-distribution network, could penetrate more markets. 

The company said the water will be called Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in Coors beer.
The company said it will sell the water plain and with lemon-lime and cherry flavors and will package it in 28-ounce bottles and 6.5 ounce bottles as part of six-packs. 

The test markets, though not specified, will be in northern California, Arizona and Colorado, some of the hottest bottled-water markets. 

Rochester Telephone Corp. said it agreed to buy Viroqua Telephone Co. of Viroqua, Wis.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Rochester will exchange shares of its common stock for all shares outstanding of Viroqua Telephone, a family-owned company. 

Viroqua serves about 3,000 access lines in western Wisconsin. 

The amount of blood surgical patients can donate and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug, EPO. 

EPO, or erythropoietin, is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells.
A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by Amgen Corp. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., recently has been marketed by the Ortho Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson & Johnson.
A competing version of EPO is being developed by Genetics Institute Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
The drug is being used primarily to treat anemias. 

A new experiment, reported in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, involved giving injections of Amgen's EPO to 23 patients who wanted to store units of their own blood. 

The patients began receiving EPO injections about a month before their scheduled surgery.
They then began donating blood twice a week, receiving an EPO injection each time.
If tests indicated a low number of red cells, blood wasn't taken. 

The EPO-treated patients donated an average of 5.4 units of blood each compared with only 4.1 units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a placebo injection.
The volume of red cells donated by the EPO-treated patients was 41% higher per donor, the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported. 

A merchant bank and investment fund have agreed to co-sponsor a reorganization plan to bring Sharon Steel Corp. out of Chapter 11 proceedings and to acquire the company's steel-related assets in a transaction valued at more than $300 million. 

Castle Harlan Inc., a New York merchant bank, and Quantum Fund said they would acquire the assets for a combination of cash and the assumption of certain of Sharon's liabilities.
The balance of the company's assets and liabilities would be transferred to a new company that would be owned by Sharon's creditors.
Quantum said it has agreed to purchase as much as $50 million in equity in the new company, if necessary, for the confirmation of the plan. 

Castle Harlan and Quantum said the plan is expected to be filed within 60 days with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Pittsburgh.
The agreement is subject to certain conditions, including obtaining financing.
Castle Harlan said that such financing is already being sought and that a formal proposal would be made to Sharon's Chapter 11 trustee and other Sharon creditors over the next few days. 

Sharon, based in Farrell, Pa., filed for protection from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code in April 1987.
The company had been one of the maninstays of Miami Beach financier Victor Posner's empire.
Mr. Posner resigned as president and chief executive officer of Sharon in April 1988.
He remains chairman, but wields little power at the company. 

Quantum Fund, based in New York, is a $2.1 billion investment fund managed by Soros Fund Management.
Quantum is Sharon's largest unsecured creditor.
The Castle Harlan group includes Walter Sieckman, former chief operating officer of Sharon, and Wolfgang Jansen, former executive vice president. 

Executives at Sharon declined to comment on the proposal.
The company's trustee, F.E. Agnew, was unavailable for comment. 

Brooks Armored Car Service Inc. never wanted to get into money laundering. 

But July 5, a thunderstorm in Wilmington, Del., caused Shellpot Creek to rise 15 feet, pouring 1.3 million gallons of water into basement vaults.
The water destroyed about $75 million in currency and caked $4 million of coins with mud, rendering them dangerous to counting machines. 

The $75 million in paper money, although moldy, mildewy and smelly, was exchanged through the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia without incident.
But Brooks was unable to reach a coin-cleaning agreement with the government. 

"We kind of got caught between bureaucracies," says President William F. Brooks Jr.
The U.S. Mint wouldn't take the coin because it wasn't mutilated, and the Federal Reserve Bank accepts only clean coins, he says. 

The Philadelphia Fed says it is merely an "agent" for coins, responsible only for storage and distribution. "We issue paper money; we destroy paper money," says Jane Hinkle, a Philadelphia Fed spokeswoman. "The coin is their problem." 

A Mint official says the agency offered to clean the coins for its "bare-bones" cost of $17,000 plus certain other expenses.
But Brooks declined, figuring that transporting the mucked up money to Washington would cost the company thousands more. 

So Brooks gave the dirty work to Coin Wrap Inc., which came up with an unusual solution. 

For eight hours a day for the past two weeks, in aggregates of as much as 27,000 pounds (equaling $20,000 in pennies), Coin Wrap has been pouring money into a cement-mixing truck.
A giant heater, working like a blowtorch, causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers.
After clanging around for an hour or so, the shiny, hot money pours out of the cement chute, where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers.
After cooling, the coins are then rewrapped. 

Brooks expects to pay Coin Wrap a total of about $20,000 -- a cost that insurance won't cover.
And while the job is half done, Brooks is still bitter.
In fact, there's only one person involved who's happy, and that's Floyd String, president of Coin Wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck solution.
Not only did his company find $20,000 worth of work, but when the approach was suggested, Mr. String says, Brooks officials "didn't laugh at me or anything." 

H. Marshall Schwarz was named chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Trust Corp., a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $17 billion. 

Mr. Schwarz, 52 years old, will succeed Daniel P. Davison Feb. 1, soon after Mr. Davison reaches the company's mandatory retirement age of 65.
Mr. Schwarz, who is president of U.S. Trust, will be succeeded in that post by Jeffrey S. Maurer, 42, who is executive vice president in charge of the company's asset-management group. 

U.S. Trust, a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the U.S., has faced intensifying competition from other firms that have established, and heavily promoted, private-banking businesses of their own.
As a result, U.S. Trust's earnings have been hurt. 

But Mr. Schwarz welcomes the competition in U.S. Trust's flagship businesses, calling it "flattery." Mr. Schwarz says the competition "broadens the base of opportunity for us." Other firms "are dealing with the masses.
I don't believe they have the culture" to adequately service high-net-worth individuals, he adds.
U.S. Trust recently introduced certain mutual-fund products, which allow it to serve customers with minimum deposits of $250,000.
Previously, the company advertised at the $2 million level. 

"We have always taken smaller accounts, but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow," Mr. Schwarz says. "Our bread and butter is still the $2 million to $20 million account," he says.
The new services allow U.S. Trust to cater to the "new wealth," Mr. Schwarz says. 

Quarterly net income this year has risen just over comparable periods in 1988, when year-end net was below the 1987 level.
In this year's third quarter, for example, net was $10.5 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with $10.3 million, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier.
Assets as of Sept. 30 fell to $2.46 billion from about $2.77 billion. "We will have a reasonably flat year this year," Mr. Schwarz says.
Mr. Schwarz also said costs associated with U.S. Trust's planned move to midtown Manhattan from Wall Street will continue to be a drag on earnings through 1990. 

Mr. Schwarz's great-grandfather founded the New York toy store F.A.O. Schwarz, but his family no longer has ties to the company.
Mr. Schwarz's father was a U.S. Trust trustee until 1974. 

U.S. Trust also created a four-member office of the chairman, effective Feb. 1.
It will include Messrs.
Schwarz and Maurer.
Donald M. Roberts, 54, treasurer, and Frederick S. Wonham, 58, who takes responsibility for the funds-service group, were named vice chairmen and will serve in the office of the chairman.
Mr. Roberts continues as treasurer, and Mr. Wonham remains responsible for the offices of comptroller, planning, marketing and general services. 

Frederick B. Taylor, 48, also was named a vice chairman and chief investment officer, a new post.
He previously held similar responsibilities.
Mr. Taylor also was named a director, increasing the board to 22, but is not part of the new office of the chairman. 

James E. Bacon, 58, executive vice president, who has directed the funds-service group, will retire. 

I read the exerpts of Wayne Angell's exchange with a Gosbank representative ("Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails," editorial page, Oct. 5) with great interest, since the gold standard is one of my areas of research.
Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union's large gold reserves would give it "great power to establish credibility." During the latter part of the 19th century, Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100% of its outstanding currency, but no one outside Russia used rubles. 

The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30% of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world.
The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain.
By contrast, in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose, much as it would in today's Soviet Union. 

The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law, rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency.
It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914, when the Bank of England was an independent private bank, the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended, but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England, the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined. 

The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency.
One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws.
Unless the laws determining the noteholder's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes, however, a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars.

For all of this year's explosive run-up in stock prices, Renaissance Investment Management Inc. 's computer sat on the sidelines.
Now it's on the fence. 

Renaissance, a Cincinnati-based money manager, began buying stocks again this week with half of the $1.8 billion that it oversees for clients, according to people familiar with the firm's revised strategy.
It was the first time since January that Renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning. 

Renaissance declined to confirm the move, but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday, timed to coincide with the maturity this week of Treasury bills owned by the firm.
The other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in Treasury bills for the time being. 

Wall Street executives said they believed that Renaissance's $900 million buy program was carried out by PaineWebber Inc.
As reported, PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift, although the broker's client was said then to have been Japanese.
Yesterday, PaineWebber declined comment. 

When it owns stocks, Renaissance's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues; to make buy or sell moves, the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance, looking for the best package price to carry out the trades.
The broker winning the business doesn't charge commissions, but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price. 

That puts the broker at risk if it's trying to buy stock in a rising market.
In Tuesday's gyrating session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 80 points early in the day, but finished with less than a four-point loss. 

Renaissance's last portfolio shift, carried out by Goldman, Sachs & Co., was a highly publicized decision last January to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy Treasury bills.
The sell signal, which sent a bearish chill through the stock market, came when Renaissance's computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and Treasury bills. 

At the time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at about 2200.
The Dow average now stands more than 20% higher, while Renaissance's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6% through the first three quarters of the year.
The computer's miscalculation has been painful for Renaissance.
Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results, while Renaissance has played it safe with Treasury bills. 

So why does Renaissance's computer like stocks with the Dow at 2653.28, where it closed yesterday, when it didn't with the Dow at 2200? 

"With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates, stocks are representing a better value all the time," Renaissance President Frank W. Terrizzi said yesterday. 

Three-month T-bill yields have fallen to 7.8% from about 9% at the start of the year.
Stock prices, meanwhile, are about 140 points lower than the peak of 2791.41 reached on the Dow industrial average Oct. 9.
Are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks? 

Mr. Terrizzi won't say specifically, explaining that if there was such a move, it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction.
During that time, a buyer with the clout of a Renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand. 

But everything is relative to Mr. Terrizzi, so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or T-bills, even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in January. "Our {computer} model has a certain trigger point," he said.
When the computer says switch, Renaissance switches. 

The firm has made 17 previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10-year history.
Almost all have involved at least half and often the firm's entire portfolio, as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category, following a money-management style called tactical asset allocation. 

Competing asset-allocation firms march to their own computer models, so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while Renaissance has sat on the sidelines.
As a result, competitors say Renaissance has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market, rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in Treasury bills. 

Mr. Terrizzi confirms some clients have left Renaissance, but no major ones, and the firm has added new accounts. 

Chandler Insurance Co. said it expects to report third-quarter net income jumped 97% to $2.8 million, or 51 cents a share. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the automobile and trucking insurer had earnings of $1.4 million, or 48 cents a share on a restated basis, on revenue of $16.5 million.
In an interview, W. Brent LeGere, chairman and chief executive officer, said he expects revenue in the latest quarter to total about $28 million.
The earnings-per-share figures reflect a 25% stock dividend in June 1989. 

Mr. LeGere attributed the earnings increase to growth in the company's longhaul trucking insurance lines and the ability to keep premium rates firm.

WASHINGTON -- United Technologies Corp. won an $18 million Army contract for helicopter modifications and spare parts. 

The company will modify one UH-60A Blackhawk transport helicopter to the prototype MH-60K configuration for use by military special forces. 

Ingalls Shipbuilding Inc., a division of Litton Industries Inc., was given a $15.5 million extension on a contract for shipyard services. 

Some of America's biggest trading partners gave a quick thumbs-down to a U.S. proposal to liberalize world trade and reduce farm-product subsidies. 

In Geneva, where world trade talks are being held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, the European Community called the U.S. proposal "a step backward." And Japan's minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries told a committee of Japan's parliament that Washington's proposal was impractical and that Tokyo would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers. 

The U.S., in a far-reaching plan submitted to the Geneva meeting Tuesday, proposed curbing price support subsidies within 10 years and eliminating export subsidies within five years.
U.S. officials said the plan was flexible, and was intended as a pragmatic approach for gradually removing trade-distorting subsidies. 

But the EC reacted defiantly, arguing that the proposal's main aim is to destroy the Common Agricultural Policy, the EC's $28 billion-a-year price support program. "The American proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation," the EC said in a statement. 

EC officials say they are irked that the U.S. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the "elimination" of export subsides, not just reduction.
EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry said the U.S. plan "calls into question" the agreement reached by world negotiators last April in Geneva seeking "substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection." 

U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Jules Katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the April accord.
He said he was surprised by the EC's reaction, calling it "vehement, even frenetic." 

The U.S. proposal also was criticized by food-importing developing countries, who said that the U.S. made no special allowances for poor nations.
While many experts argue that food-importing nations would eventually become self-sufficient in a free-market system, the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime. 

Ambassador Katz said the U.S. was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries. 

The U.S. administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the free-trade goals would be achieved.
The U.S. argues that its plan would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by converting certain non-tariff barriers into tariffs that, together with existing tariffs, then would be phased out over 10 years.
But the EC is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs. 

The new U.S. package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.
It would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily. 

Seeking to allay European concerns, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in Washington that the new U.S. plan wouldn't "put farmers out of business" but would encourage them to "grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants." 

The EC, with a population of 320 million, has 8.5 million farmers, while the U.S., with a population of about 245 million, has only two million farmers. 

Japan's objections to the U.S. plan center around its desire to stay self-sufficient in rice, a staple food, even though foreign producers are far more efficient. 

This has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official American policy toward Moscow.
It has also been a week when inside-the-beltway Washington has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President Reagan's multimillion-dollar junket in Japan.
The latter may seem oddly irrelevant, if not downright trivial, given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation's capital has done nothing to dispel that impression.
In fact, however, Mr. Reagan's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something.
Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal. 

Those events continue to move at a rate, and in a direction, which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake.
Earlier this week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and, to put it bluntly, "engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty" by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk.
Hungary is no longer a "Socialist Peoples" republic, the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R.'s Congress of Peoples Deputies and Egon Krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as East Germany's new maximum leader.
All of that is just for starters, or so the hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding. 

Of like, though lesser, note, Secretary of State James Baker put the administration four-square behind perestroika and glasnost, and therefore behind Mikhail Gorbachev, in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past week or so.
And, last but not least, President George Bush now views the changes in Eastern Europe as "absolutely extraordinary" and believes that Mr. Krenz "can't turn the clock back" in East Germany because the change is too inexorable," as he told the New York Times's R.W. Apple Jr. (In other words, after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences, the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are witnessing from Berlin to Siberia is a good thing to be welcomed, rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with suspicion.) 

All of this is what history will note, assuming that events don't make it seem a bad joke, when the record of this time is put down.
For journalists, however, who write what they fondly view as history's first draft, this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to Ron and Nancy's sales appearance in Japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder.
It has been a well-paid transaction, this bartering away of the prestige of the republic's highest office.
The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $2 million, the Japanese government has put up just about as much, or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $7 million. 

All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon, as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC's "Nightline." Punching away, we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow, but at the end of the affair, there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target.
As one of his defenders so aptly put it, President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election (and some would say thereafter as well).
He was performing for pay, and why should anyone expect anything more? 

Primarily because there's more to the matter than Ronald Reagan's personal values, or lack of them.
Selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so much a devaluation from the norm of public life today as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards.
The theme song for the 1980s has been, "Anything Goes," and it has been whistled with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism. 

There are those who say that this is nothing new, that America has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced.
There is evidence to support that view.
Eighty-three years ago, William James wrote to H.G. Wells: "The moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success . . . that, with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word success, is our national disease." 

But if it was the national disease in 1906, it is today the national commonplace.
If there is no law against it, do it.
If the law leaves loopholes, use them.
If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it, full speed ahead.
And if you are caught or if people complain, simply argue that "everyone does it" or "no one said I shouldn't " and brazen it out.
As a last recourse, when all else has failed and you are pinned, apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong. (See, for instance, Jim Bakker's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful.) Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the Iran-Contra affair.
The Soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government "violated norms of behavior" in Afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station.
We have people in high place still lying through their teeth about Iran-Contra, and that apparently isn't going to change.
For that matter, those long ago identified as liars are still given respectful hearings in the press. 

That is the key to the current "national disease." No one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrowest construction of the law.
The occasional media witch hunt about some politician's private peccadilloes notwithstanding, the general inclination is to offer a version of the old refrain, "Who am I to judge?" Thus, no standards, no judgment and no values. 

"You are mad because he's making so much money," say President Reagan's defenders.
No, we ought to be mad because he has demeaned the office we gave him, enlisting it in the service of private gain, just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth, play disingenuous games about their activities or, to steal a phrase, make public service a private trough. 

"I'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this, President Bush told Mr. Apple in this week's interview.
He was referring to the "absolutely extraordinary" events in Eastern Europe, and it is a defensible position.
But there is no defense at all for the ethos of the 1980s.
We didn't stampede into it, we slithered and slipped down the long slope, and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah.
Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the United States of 1989: Everything for sale; nothing of real value. 

Mr. Carter is a political commentator who heads a television production firm. 

In a rare package sale of its real estate, K mart Corp., Troy, Mich., has sold 17 of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led by New York developer Philip Pilevsky, according to sources familiar with the transaction.
They estimate the value of the transaction at close to $100 million. 

K mart officials and Mr. Pilevsky wouldn't comment on the sale. 

K mart previously had announced it would report its third consecutive decline in quarterly earnings for the period ended yesterday, the same day the real estate deal was completed. 

Analysts are estimating third-quarter earnings will drop between 13% and 20% to about 50 to 55 cents per share, compared with 63 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.
It is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have on earnings. 

K mart developed the centers, which range in size from about 150,000 square feet to just over 250,000 square feet.
Most are anchored by a K mart store.
The retailer reportedly will lease its stores back from the developer, who plans to expand the small centers. 

The centers comprise a total of about 1.6 million square feet of retail space.
They are spread around the country and include locations in California, Florida, Washington and Arizona. 

Mr. Pilevsky, who heads Philips International Holding Corp., a New York-based real estate company, owns more than a dozen other shopping centers in which K mart is a tenant.
The company is active in office and residential development in New York.
However, nationally, Mr. Pilevsky controls through limited partnerships about 85 shopping centers with about 17 million square feet. 

K mart runs 2,200 K mart stores, primarily in leased facilities.
The company typically sells the centers it develops, but has usually sold only one or several at a time. 

Troubled SCI Television Inc. proposed to restructure much of its $1.3 billion in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations. 

The leveraged buy-out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which owns 46% of the common equity of SCI TV, indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to 15%, giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring. 

KKR also signaled to the company's creditors that Henry Kravis and other KKR directors of SCI TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting rights. 

Holders of SCI TV's $507 million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to forgive a lot of debt in exchange for taking a 39% equity stake in SCI TV.
They immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company's problems. 

"I think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done," says analyst Craig Davis of R.D. Smith & Co. here. 

Investors interpreted the KKR move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of SCI TV.
But a spokesman for KKR says that with only a 15% equity stake, it wouldn't be appropriate for KKR to keep board representation. 

KKR already has made about $1 billion of gains from earlier transactions with SCI TV, thus it isn't significantly affected by the company's troubles. 

SCI TV, which is controlled by Nashville, Tenn., entrepreneur George Gillett, owns six TV stations, including several CBS Inc. affiliates.
It is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in 1987 for a leveraged buy-out. 

Through investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., SCI TV is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar.
KKR would give up a 31% equity stake to bondholders, while Mr. Gillett would surrender an 8% stake.
While one big SCI TV investor thinks that's pretty generous, many junkholders had been hoping that KKR and Mr. Gillett would invest new money in SCI TV.
Those investors think SCI TV needs new equity to survive. 

SCI TV's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $153 million of bank debt.
It also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds that have fallen due; the grace period for paying the bill expires Nov. 16. 

At the same time, investors estimate the restructuring would cut the company's annual cash interest bill from about $90 million to $85 million.
Yet to pay that interest bill, analysts say SCI TV will only produce about $80 million to $90 million of cash flow a year. 

C. Hyde Tucker will become president and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic International Inc., a unit of this telecommunications concern, effective Jan. 1.
Mr. Tucker, 56 years old, is currently vice president and chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic's C&P Telephone unit.
Mr. Tucker will succeed Salvatore J. Barbera, 64, who will hold the newly created position of chairman of the international unit until his retirement April 1. 

The average unemployment rate in the 15 biggest industrialized democracies was steady in August at the 6.1% rate of the two previous months, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. 

The August rate was 0.6 percentage point lower than in the like month a year earlier, reflecting the pickup of activity in the 15 countries. 

The OECD said that most of the improvement occurred in the second half of last year; since February of this year, unemployment has been steady at around 6.2% of the labor force. 

PWA Corp. said it plans to sell by spring 1992 all 15 passenger planes it acquired earlier this year in its 248 million Canadian dollar (US$211.6 million) purchase of Wardair Inc. 

PWA, which recently merged Wardair's operations with those of PWA-owned Canadian Airlines International Ltd., Canada's second-biggest airline, said the proposed sale is part of a revised five-year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt. 

PWA wouldn't estimate the value of Wardair's aircraft, which include 12 Airbus A310-300s and three Boeing 747-100s.
But James Ireland, a Miami-based technical analyst with Avmark Inc., an aircraft evaluation firm, estimated the total "half-life" value of the 15 planes at about $650 million or more. 

Mr. Ireland said 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA also said it plans to sell, beginning in 1992, have a current half-life value of about $34 million each, or a total $374 million, raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $1.02 billion. 

Mr. Ireland said current demand for used aircraft is strong, partly because surging orders for new aircraft have lengthened waiting lists.
He predicted that PWA would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers. 

Under its revised fleet plan, PWA said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994, and add four more Boeing 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year.
PWA said two of the Boeing 767-300ER aircraft scheduled for delivery in 1990 would be leased out for two to five years. 

PWA didn't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul, but a Toronto-based analyst estimated it at about $450 million (US), excluding replacement costs for the 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA plans to sell, and purchase costs for as many as 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft that PWA previously ordered. 

"I don't see this as a debt reduction exercise.
It's focused on streamlining" PWA's fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft servicing costs, the analyst said.
PWA's long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to C$1.24 billion at the end of the second quarter, nearly double the year-earlier figure, reflecting debt absorbed under the Wardair purchase. 

PWA said it also expects to announce by Tuesday whether it will take delivery of all 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft it previously ordered.
The first five leased units were to be delivered in 1991. 

This year is the 75th anniversary of the Federal Reserve System, and some members of Congress think it's time to take a fresh look at the nation's central bank.
After 75 years there may be a few things that are worth reexamining. 

The regional Federal Reserve Bank setup, for instance, may be out of date.
In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond, Va., a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank, but times have changed.
Maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism; the Fed, after all, is a national central bank. 

Some of the would-be reformers, however, want to restore an arrangement we once had -- or, at least, part of it.
In the beginning, the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board.
But in 1935, when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression, it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board. 

Carter Glass, a former treasury secretary who was then back in Congress, probably influenced the decision.
He said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and, somehow, he didn't think that was a good thing. 

Times have changed.
Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) has introduced a bill in Congress, co-sponsored by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), that would put the treasury secretary back on the board.
There is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least Congress, as in 1935, would be doing something.
So far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board. 

Nicholas Brady, the incumbent treasury secretary, is of course aware of the proposal, and he doesn't like it much.
Mr. Dorgen has changed tactics, dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea.
That may have pleased the secretary, but H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the power he needs. 

Like most treasury secretaries, Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters, of course.
He was, in fact, taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury.
After the October 1987 market crash, Mr. Brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it.
One of the commission's recommendations was that a single agency, probably the Federal Reserve, should coordinate regulation of all financial markets. 

This recommendation might have encouraged a turf-hungry bureaucrat to try to expand his power, but so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hasn't made a pitch for the job.
The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well.
Mr. Brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions, but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago. 

In recent weeks, moreover, Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates.
The urging admittedly has been gentle.
In an interview with the Washington Post in early October, the secretary said the Fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is, while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth. 

At least some economists, of course, would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis.
Earlier this month the St. Louis Fed held a conference to assess the system's first 75 years.
Allan Meltzer, a Carnegie-Mellon University economist, noted that the Fed's record included the longest, most sustained, peacetime inflation in our history, dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989.
The inflation-growth argument is an old one, but Mr. Brady, on the board or off, is surely trying to influence Fed policy. 

Equally importantly, the treasury secretary has spearheaded the administration effort to bring the U.S. dollar down by shopping avidly for West German marks and Japanese yen.
The treasury can do something on its own, but to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed.
The central bank has been helping, but apparently not especially eagerly. 

The Fed has been intervening in foreign currency markets, all right, but through August, at least, it appeared to be "sterilizing" the intervention.
In other words, it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market. 

Now, sterilized intervention may have some effect.
When traders see the Fed is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully, for fear of what the central bank may do.
But it's generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values.
After August the Fed may have stopped sterilizing, but it's hard to see much impact on the dollar.
The dollar is still highly volatile.
The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly, but whether the main reason was dollar intervention, the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment, or the Friday 13 market drop, only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know. 

Earlier this year, Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, argued forcefully that a government that wants steady, stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies.
Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level, he said, "would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation." 

The more we think about it, the more we suspect Mr. Brady does indeed have enough power where he already is. 

Sears, Roebuck & Co. signed a contract with Bob Vila, the former host of the popular public television program "This Old House," to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer. 

The do-it-yourself show, slated to start airing by June 1990, marks Sears's entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products.
In recent months, sales of home improvement items have sagged, along with sales of other big ticket durable goods. 

The show also signals Mr. Vila's return as a television celebrity.
Earlier this year, public television station WGBH in Boston fired Mr. Vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements. 

With Mr. Vila as host, "This Old House" became one of the Public Broadcasting Service's top 10 programs, airing weekly on about 300 of the network's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers. 

But Home Depot Inc., an Atlanta-based home center chain, objected when Mr. Vila started doing commercial endorsements for Rickel Home Centers, a New Jersey building supply company that competes with Home Depot in some markets. 

"I'm ecstatic about the change," said Mr. Vila, whose new syndicated program is called "Home Again with Bob Vila." In an interview, Mr. Vila criticized his old show, which is continuing with a new host. 

"Public TV is in fantasy land," he said. "Last season, we did a story that involved spending $700,000 in converting a two-family house into a bed and breakfast." In the new show, he said, "we're going to spend $60,000 building a start-up house" for a young couple. 

While Sears wouldn't comment on the brouhaha over Mr. Vila's commercial endorsements, it appears to be building a fence around Mr. Vila's affections.
His contract makes him "exclusive" spokesman for Sears's home improvement marketing campaigns.
Ogilvy & Mather in Chicago, a unit of WPP Group PLC, will handle the advertising account and syndication. 

The only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of Time-Life home improvement and repair books.
His other agreements to promote products have expired.
Little matter for Mr. Vila, who complains that "public TV never paid me more than $40,000 a year." He said his compensation under the Sears contract is "a multimillion dollar deal." 

Alvin W. Trivelpiece, director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tenn., was elected a director of this optical-products concern.
Mr. Trivelpiece, 58 years old, succeeds William Bolger, who died in August. 

Two West German chemical companies announced steps that apparently are designed to boost the chemical industry's standing among environmental groups and the general public. 

Hoechst AG's Chairman Wolfgang Hilger said the company wants to have a substitute product to completely replace ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons by 1995.
In April, Hoechst, the largest producer of CFCs in West Germany, said it wanted to reduce production of the product by 50% by 1993. 

Mr. Hilger said Hoechst will invest 50 million marks ($27.2 million) in a plant to make a substitute product it has developed that it says is unchlorinated.
The company hopes the new plant, likely to be built in Frankfurt, will be able to produce 10,000 tons a year.
This year, Hoechst will produce about 62,000 tons of CFCs in factories in Frankfurt, Spain and Brazil. 

Of Hoechst's 40.9 billion marks in group sales in 1988, 200 million marks came from sales of CFCs. 

Also, BASF AG, another large chemicals company, said it formed a separate division that will study the environmental impact of plastics and will investigate all possibilities of recycling plastics. 

Calgon Carbon Corp. said it will build a $40 million plant for producing granular activated carbon.
The maker of water-treatment chemicals and equipment said it will select the plant site early next year, and production is expected to begin in 1991. 

Furukawa Electric Co. said it plans to increase production of computer memory devices on a large scale in the U.S. and Japan. 

As part of the move, its affiliated U.S. company, International Components Technology Corp., purchased a Mexican plant formerly belonging to KSI Disc Products Inc.
The price wasn't disclosed. 

Together with two existing plants in the U.S., Furukawa said it will expand its current local monthly production of memory disks to 1.4 million sheets from 800,000.
In Japan, Furukawa said it will raise production at a plant outside Tokyo to 300,000 sheets monthly from 100,000. 

Furukawa said the U.S. market is strengthening as related computer technology gains in sophistication and quality. 

A few years ago, I was on a panel of journalists that discussed the "image" of intercollegiate athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others.
We scribblers quickly concurred that not only was the bad rep of big-time college sports richly earned, but also that it could be corrected.
Competition could be maintained -- and stadiums probably would remain full -- if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students, we said.
Comments from the audience reflected widespread, if wistful, agreement with those conclusions. 

As the session broke up, I was approached by a man who identified himself as the alumni director of a Big Ten university. "I'd love to see sports cut back, and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools, but everybody's afraid to make the first move," he confided. "It's like the U.S. and the Russians: Nobody wants to disarm first." 

And so our institutions of higher learning lurch from scandal to scandal on gridiron and basketball court, while the casualties mount.
Three new books make the point that one large price of the glittery college-sports show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it.
They are: "A Payroll to Meet: A Story of Greed, Corruption and Football at SMU" (Macmillan, 221 pages, $18.95) by David Whitford; "Big Red Confidential: Inside Nebraska Football" (Contemporary, 231 pages, $17.95) by Armen Keteyian; and "Never Too Young to Die: The Death of Len Bias" (Pantheon, 252 pages, $18.95) by Lewis Cole. 

The pick of the group is "Payroll"; it should be required reading for every college president.
It chronicles how, over a period of a dozen years, Southern Methodist University bought its way to football respectability in the Southwest Conference, only to find itself trapped and strangled by the athlete-payoff system it created.
The school was the first, in 1987, to receive the NCAA's "death penalty" -- two years without football -- for repeated rules violations.
Given current headlines about the University of Florida, it may not be the last. 

The man who brought the bribe to the Dallas school was Ron Meyer, a flashy sort who came in 1975 to rescue a woebegone program, Mr. Whitford writes.
Mr. Meyer's personal style was illustrated by his pinning a $100 bill to a high-school bulletin board on which other coaches tacked their cards.
One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $10 and $20 bills that prospects sang "Here Comes Santa Claus" when he approached. 

Paying players at SMU was no casual operation.
It involved the athletics director, two different football coaching staffs, and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody, it seemed, but Donald Shields, the university's president.
There's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields, having finally learned of the practice, expresses his outrage to Bill Clements, then a university governor (and now the governor of Texas!) and oil man Edwin Cox, chairman of the board of trustees. 

"You stay out of it," author Whitford quotes Mr. Clements as saying. "Go run the university." Which was about what Mr. Shields did, and quietly, until he resigned a few years later, pleading ill health, when the stuff hit the fan. 

Mr. Whitford drew on voluminous news media coverage of the SMU scandal, and on a university internal investigation.
Mr. Keteyian had to do most of his own digging on University of Nebraska football, which is, to date, high and dry as far as the NCAA is concerned.
Unfortunately, he gets low grades as an investigative reporter, relying heavily on what Chicago's late mayor, Richard J. Daley, called "insinuendo." 

Discrepancies go unexplained in "Confidential" (one ex-player claims he received $4,000 to $5,000 for his season football tickets while others said theirs brought only a few hundred dollars), and when Mr. Keteyian can't nail down something, like who really owned a car driven by Husker tailback Doug Dubose, he simply reprints his notes. 

There are gratuitous references to supposed romantic liaisons between Husker players and a low-level female university employee.
A serious charge -- that star flanker Irving Fryar "threw" the 1984 Orange Bowl game by intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone -- is included, even though the Nebraska assistant coach quoted denied making it. 

Still, the book produces more smoke than a smoldering sofa, along with a few flames, especially concerning the use of steroids.
Dean Steinkuhler, a spectacularly bulked-up former lineman, confesses that he used 'em, and says other Huskers did too.
It's a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of Nebraska coaches.
Probably, it didn't. 

"Never Too Young" is a different sort of work, focusing on the 1986 death from cocaine ingestion of Bias, a University of Maryland basketball star ticketed for sure pro stardom.
While the university was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other student, it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath. 

Bias's coach, Lefty Driesell, ordered the room in which Bias died to be cleaned before the police could arrive (the order wasn't carried out), and the school's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of Bias and other players.
Those, of course, were the responses of people with something to hide.
One wonders how other college athletic officials would behave under the same circumstances. 

Tomorrow's "On Sports" column will look at another aspect of the college sports mess. 

An investment company said it offered to acquire Arby's Inc., the fast-food operator, for $205 million. 

The proposal, however, was immediately rebuffed by Arby's parent, DWG Corp. "Arby's isn't for sale," said Renee Mottram, senior vice president at DWG. 

The new suitor, Stevric Equity Ventures Inc., of Mineola, N.Y., characterized its proposal as the "first truly independent offer which does not pit one interest group against another within the Arby's franchisee community." 

In September, DWG, a Miami Beach, Fla., holding company controlled by financeer Victor Posner, rejected an offer from a group of Arby's franchisees to acquire Arby's for $200 million.
Since then, a second group of franchisees has banded together to try to wrestle control of the unit from Mr. Posner.
Arby's is the marketing, franchising and service company for the 2,100 restaurants in the chain. 

Stevric's principals, Richard and Steven Buckley, said they led the acquisition group that acquired the Nathan's Famous Inc. restaurant chain and subsequently served as the top officers of the company.
Richard Buckley said Stevric's acquisition of Arby's "would allow seasoned franchisers and food-service operators, with no conflicts of interest, to stabilize franchisee relations and properly refocus the company's energies toward growth." 

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing "circuit breakers" to halt program trading at volatile times. 

Mr. Breeden, in his first testimony to Congress since taking the SEC post, said the agency is studying the Friday the 13th market plunge, including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following Monday.
After the study, the SEC would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine-tuning the current ones, he added. 

Circuit breakers, designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements, curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points.
At certain points during the Friday the 13th drop, circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market, slowing trading at times.
A circuit breaker that would have closed down the New York Stock Exchange wasn't tripped. 

Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb "turmoil" in the marketplace.
He argued that program-trading by roughly 15 big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors. 

Mr. Breeden didn't reject the proposal.
After the SEC study of the drop is completed, he said, "I'm perfectly happy to work with this committee . . . in identifying whether we need other devices," such as a program-trading curb. 

Mr. Breeden backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the SEC brought to the subcommittee last year under then-chairman David Ruder.
The measure is expected to move through this Congress.
But the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress. 

Mr. Breeden contended that uncertainty over when the SEC might act could worsen volatility in the markets.
He argued that the current circuit-breaker system allows investors to know "precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last." 

Mr. Breeden offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill.
One would force brokerage houses to provide the SEC detailed information about loans made by their holding companies.
Such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs, and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms. 

He also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a systematic basis.
That information, he argued, is critical to reconstructing sharp market moves, such as the one nearly two weeks ago. 

Burmah Oil PLC, a British independent oil company, said its West German subsidiary Castrol has a 49% share in Explonaft G.m.b.
H., a new Polish lubricants company. 

The remaining 51% of the joint venture will be controlled by Polish lubricants manufacturers, refiners and technical institutes.
Explonaft will develop application guidelines for lubricants, sell high-quality mineral oils, and offer services in industrial cleaning and related fields. 

Burmah, which has a strong market position supplying marine lubricants and metal-working fluids in Poland, described the joint venture as "fairly small." It didn't provide details of setup costs. 

NORTH SIDE SAVINGS BANK directors declared an initial dividend of 10 cents a share, payable Dec. 5 to stock of record Nov. 21.
The Floral Park, N.Y., thrift has a strong capital-to-assets ratio, said Vice President Michael D.N. Confer.
At Sept. 30, the thrift, which converted to a stock form of ownership from a mutual form in April 1986, had more than four million shares outstanding. 

Sun Microsystems Inc., snapping back to profitability after its first quarterly loss as a public firm, said it earned $5.2 million, or seven cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter. 

Sun, a maker of computer workstations, reported sales of $538.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 29, up 39% from $388.5 million a year earlier.
In the 1988 period, the company earned $20.6 million, or 26 cents a share. 

Sun's results were slightly better than expectations.
Earlier this month, the company said it expected to break even for the quarter on sales of $530 million. 

In a statement, Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive officer, said the company's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April.
One of those new computers, called Sparcstation 1, accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter, he said.
More than two-thirds of the systems shipped, meanwhile, were products introduced in April. 

But problems in manufacturing, forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for Sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer.
These problems also resulted in Sun reporting a $20.3 million loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30. 

Mr. McNealy said the issues that hurt Sun's performance earlier this year are now "largely" behind the firm, and he indicated that Sun's profitability should increase throughout the fiscal year. 

Sun also reported a record backlog of orders.
While this indicates continued strong demand for the company's desk-top computers, Sun faces increasing competition from Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Recently, analysts have said Sun also is vulnerable to competition from International Business Machines Corp., which plans to introduce a group of workstations early next year, and Next Inc. 

Compaq Computer Corp. said that its net income rose 51% in the third quarter, bolstered by unusual gains from its investment in a disk-drive maker and reflecting continued growth in its European operations. 

The computer maker said net jumped to $87 million, or $2.02 a share, from $58 million, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier.
Sales increased 36% to $683 million from $502 million.
The latest quarter's results, however, included a pretax gain of $13.7 million, or 20 cents a share, in the carrying value of the company's investment in Conner Peripherals Inc. and a $7.6 million gain, or 11 cents a share, from the sale of one million Conner shares. 

Net for the nine months was $254 million, or $5.94 a share, up 56% from $163 million, or $4.06 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 50% to $2.1 billion from $1.4 billion.
Net for the year-earlier nine months also included a gain of $9.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the carrying value of the Conner investment. 

Michael Swavely, president of Compaq's North America division, attributed the company's third-quarter performance to continued increases in international sales, which accounted for 43% of the company's sales, a 74% increase from a year earlier. 

"Over the next couple of years we would not be surprised to see Europe and international {sales} represent 50% of the company's revenues," he said. 

During the third quarter, Compaq purchased a former Wang Laboratories manufacturing facility in Stirling, Scotland, which will be used for international service and repair operations.
Mr. Swavely said the new space will allow Compaq to increase the manufacturing capacity of its plant in Erskine, Scotland. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Compaq shares fell $1.625 to $108.625. 

The Canadian government, with a view to becoming more politically active in Latin America, is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join the Organization of American States, a Washington-based regional agency. 

The expected Canadian move has been welcomed by the Bush administration even though Canada has opposed such U.S. actions as the trade embargo against Cuba, the invasion of Grenada and the military support for Nicaragua's Contra guerrillas. 

Latin American countries have long urged Canada to join the OAS in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to the U.S., which for many years tended to dominate the 32-nation organization. 

Even though the U.S. also has supported Canadian membership, it hasn't been a Washington priority. "The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why Canada's membership in the OAS hasn't been, over the years, an item high on the U.S. agenda," said Allan Gotlieb, former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. 

The Canadian application is expected to be announced in San Jose, Costa Rica, by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy. "Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere," Mr. Mulroney said recently. 

Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada's joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization. "Canada could do plenty of things to get serious about Latin America without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire" between the U.S. and Latin American members of the OAS, said Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist in Toronto's Globe & Mail newspaper. 

Canada, at times, could be an awkward OAS partner for the U.S. if its United Nations voting record is an indication.
In U.N. General Assembly votes last year, Canada voted the same as the U.S. only 63% of the time.
France voted the same as the U.S. 76% of the time, West Germany 79% and Britain 83%. 

Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal research group, said that Latin American countries would be "profoundly disappointed" if Canada were to follow the U.S. lead in the OAS. "Latin Americans see Canada as a non-interventionist power that respects their sovereignty," he said. 

The OAS, which tries to promote peace and economic development within the Americas, is attempting to find a settlement of the current Panama political crisis.
Cuba has been suspended from OAS membership, but the organization's members are discussing Cuba's reinstatement. 

One day after Delmed Inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie, its stock didn't trade and the company forecast a "significant" drop next year in sales of its core product. 

That disclosure came, a Delmed spokeswoman said, after the American Stock Exchange alerted the company that trading wouldn't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided. 

In addition to the forecast, the company also said it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead.
The spokeswoman said the exchange would resume trading of Delmed stock today. 

Delmed, which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease, on Tuesday announced the resignations of Robert S. Ehrlich, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and of Leslie I. Shapiro, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.
They were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent, Fresenius AG, which owns about 45% of Delmed. 

At the same time, the New Brunswick, N.J., company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the U.S., National Medical Care Inc. Following that announcement Tuesday, however, company officials were unavailable to elaborate. 

Yesterday, the spokeswoman said sales of Delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with National Medical accounted for 87% of Delmed's 1988 sales of $21.1 million.
The current distribution arrangement ends in March 1990, although Delmed said it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to National Medical, the spokeswoman said. 

Nonetheless, "Delmed currently expects that 1990 sales . . . will be significantly below their 1989 level," the company said in a statement. 

Delmed said yesterday that Fresenius USA would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels.
In any case, supplies to patients won't be interrupted, the company added. 

Fresenius, a West German pharmaceutical concern, has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70% and 80%.
The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed. 

But the plan now is being "reformulated," Delmed said, declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination.
Said the spokeswoman: "The whole structure has changed.
The value of the company has changed." 

Delmed did say that the proposal still would infuse cash into Delmed but less than the $10 million originally expected.
Delmed also would receive the North American rights to certain Fresenius AG products. 

Another option for Delmed, the company said, is that it could sell its plant in Ogden, Utah.
It added that no discussions about such a sale are under way. 

C.B. Rogers Jr. was named chief executive officer of this business information concern.
Mr. Rogers, 60 years old, succeeds J.V. White, 64, who will remain chairman and chairman of the executive committee.
Mr. Rogers, who was president and chief operating officer of Equifax, will retain his position as president.
The company said a new chief operating officer won't be appointed. 

William C. Ballard Jr., 48 years old, was elected a director of this distilled beverages concern, expanding the board to 11 members. 

Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole named a mediator to help resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the United Mine Workers and Pittston Co. 

W.J. Usery Jr., labor secretary during the Ford administration, was named to mediate talks to settle the six-month strike by the UMW. 

Previous talks between Pittston, of Greenwich, Conn., and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful. 

The union called the strike in April after Pittston refused to sign the UMW's national labor pact.
Pittston seeks changes in health and pension benefits, among other things.
No schedule for formal talks was set, but meetings are expected to begin soon. 

A volcano will erupt next month on the fabled Strip: a 60-foot mountain spewing smoke and flame every five minutes. 

The man-made inferno will tower over a man-made lagoon with more than four acres of pools, grottoes and waterfalls.
Visitors, whisked from the Strip on a moving walkway, will glide over a habitat for rare white tigers, which will star in performances by the famed illusionist team of Siegfried & Roy.
Nearby, six dolphins will frolic in a 1.5 million-gallon saltwater aquarium. 

At the core of all this stands a hotel.
In the lobby behind its nine-story, orchid-strewn atrium, a 20,000-gallon aquarium will come alive with sharks, stingrays, angelfish, puffers and other creatures of the deep. 

And oh, yes.
There's a casino, the financial heart of it all. 

This is the Mirage, a $630 million island-fantasy hotel-casino now being completed for opening in November by Golden Nugget Inc.
It's the most stunning example of Las Vegas's concerted effort to transform itself into a world-famous vacation resort for families as well as gamblers.
Las Vegas has seen nothing quite like it before. 

Not for 15 years has a big new hotel-casino opened here.
Now the Mirage and Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. 's $290 million Excalibur are going up.
The Excalibur, with a castlelike hotel, jousting tournaments and other Arthurian attractions, will be able to handle up to 30,000 visitors a day when it opens in 1990. 

If MGM Grand Inc. proceeds with its plan for an amusement park -- a $700 million movieland resort with a working studio, casino and 5,000-room hotel that would become Las Vegas's biggest -- the investment in the three properties will total some $1.6 billion.
MGM Grand has agreed to buy a 117-acre site for the resort for $93 million in cash plus stock currently valued at nearly $30 million. 

Smaller projects swell the figure to at least $2.5 billion.
Still other projects that have been announced but not yet started could put expenditures above $3 billion over the next few years. 

Stephen A. Wynn, who owns 29.4% of Golden Nugget's shares, says the Mirage and other projects will help Las Vegas attract a whole new generation of visitors. "If you create a wonderment, if you create something so exciting that the public dreams of being part of it, then they'll come," he says.
The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 75,500.
By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room, Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs.
The county at the end of 1988 had 307,000 jobs, 95,400 of them in the tourist industry.
Projects in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further 48,000 rooms. 

Hotel-casino operators play down the possibility of a labor shortage.
After all, 40,000 newcomers a year are settling in the Las Vegas Valley.
But Nevada state labor economists think a shortage is probable. 

Nobody yet seems to have calculated the total number of slot machines, crap tables or roulette wheels Las Vegas will add to the enormous store that Lady Luck already guards here, much less the ultimate impact of the growth on schools and municipal services. 

"Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau.
City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44% of Las Vegas tourists who fly here.
This year, by one means of transport or another, more than 18 million people will visit the city. 

The expansion will set off a marketing war among the big hotel-casinos.
Las Vegas promises, or threatens, to become a giant carnival, with rooms to be had for $45 a day or less, for visitors uninspired solely by gambling.
Amid a riot of jousting knights, circus clowns, gold-leaf centurions and creatures of the wild, lesser competitors will fall. 

Caesars World Inc. plans to defend its august reputation by sinking $190 million into its opulent Caesars Palace, next door to the new Mirage, and adding a $100 million shopping area reminiscent of Rodeo Drive.
The Palace, with its marble fountains and toga parties for high rollers, is already well-known for its Caesarean theme.
The Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace, Frontier and others are pouring millions of dollars into facelifts, new room towers and casino floor space just to keep up. 

Where's this huge amount of investment capital coming from?
Golden Nugget, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's first casino client, has borrowed on more than $600 million worth of mortgage notes, mostly sold to private investors by Drexel, to build the Mirage.
Other casino owners, Circus Circus among them, are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as First Interstate Bank of Nevada. 

Will the investments pay off?
The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will.
Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high.
Last year, the tourists left $3 billion with the area's casinos, nearly 10% more than in 1987.
The people with a stake in Nevada's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade. 

"If you build a better mousetrap, it will catch more mice," says Fred Benninger, chairman of MGM Grand.
Ellen Cokely, a tourist from Alton, Ill., seems inclined to agree. "I'd love it if my daughter had something else to do here," says Ms. Cokely, watching seven-year-old Kristin on the water slide at the Strip's Wet `n' Wild water park. 

"Two generations ago, Dad came to Las Vegas by himself for a little diversion," says Van Heffner, executive vice president of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association. "One generation ago, Mom joined Dad.
Now, in the `90s, we're headed toward a total resort environment." 

Only a decade or so ago, casino managers balked at in-room TV sets and other fripperies that distracted from gambling.
Casinos today offer bowling alleys, water parks, golf courses, tennis courts, lush swimming pools and other diversions, and more such facilities are being designed. 

Despite the new emphasis on the family trade, however, tourists in search of naughtier fun than gambling seem certain to find it, with Las Vegas call girls remaining on the scene. 

A serious economic downturn, pessimists observe, could hurt the expansionists.
For now, however, the naysayers' voices are drowned by the roar of cement mixers and the clanging of construction cranes along the Strip.
This is no place for pedestrians, but at 7:30 on a recent morning, when construction choked traffic at the famous Four Corners intersection to one lane, a taxi passenger found it faster to abandon the cab and walk to her destination. 

The ferocious competition probably will drive some poorly managed properties into bankruptcy or new ownership.
It has happened before.
The Dunes, the Aladdin and the Riviera were all acquired by the present owners from bankruptcy proceedings spawned by the last recession, in the early 1980s. 

Yet that hasn't discouraged investors.
Some have bought big chunks of Strip property for what may turn into another wave of building.
Atlantic City casino owner Donald Trump is scouting the Las Vegas market with an eye toward building an appropriately spectacular place. 

Even before the huge new projects began, the Strip's recent expansion squeezed smaller competitors.
Many blue-collar customers of downtown's no-frills gambling spots have been lured to the Strip or to Laughlin, Nev., a Colorado River town catering to snowbirds and the recreational-vehicle crowd.
Hotel expansion and an influx of more-discriminating tourists have hurt motels.
Since 1979, the number of motel rooms has fallen by 17,000. 

Many people here expect a room-rate war as the new projects open. "There's probably going to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over the next year, but after that you should see the market return to 80%-plus occupancy and regular rates," says Paul Rubeli, casino executive at Ramada Inc., which runs the Tropicana. 

Skeptics wonder whether mega-resorts such as the Mirage will be able to squeeze a profit from their cash flow.
The Mirage will cost at least $1 million a day to operate.
Mr. Wynn seems confident that it will produce a healthy profit, but some securities analysts doubt it.
Competitors and analysts say that among large existing properties Bally Manufacturing Corp. 's Bally Grand hotel-casino probably will be hardest hit among major properties.
Bally officials decline to discuss the situation. 

Bally bought the former MGM Grand hotel-casino from Kirk Kerkorian four years ago.
Only now is it undergoing a badly needed facelift.
Its parking lot is inconvenient, the MGM lion's-head logo still appears in places, and customers still call it the Grand, rather than the Bally Grand.
It has a "great location, but they're going to have some real problems when everyone around them opens," says Daniel Lee, a Drexel analyst.
Older properties that still have a 1950s image are also vulnerable. 

Any hotel-casino without a strong identity will get whacked by the new competition, says Glenn Schaeffer, senior vice president of Circus Circus. "If you don't know what you are, bigger won't make you better," he says. "But it'll sure make you poorer." 

Circus Circus's flagship casino has become the envy of competitors for its ability to vacuum cash from the pockets of vacationing families.
The Circus Circus lures them with low room rates, inexpensive buffets and entertainment for children at no extra charge.
The company's Excalibur will also appeal to families, of course.
Its castle, Mr. Schaeffer says, will be "the most compelling piece of folk architecture ever built." 

Some casino owners have resisted the temptation to add rooms.
Instead, they are spending to reinforce the identity that they believe attracts their customers. "More rooms aren't the answer for us," says Caesars World chairman Henry Gluck.
While his company's hotel is building a retail complex in Beverly Hills style and redoing existing rooms, it has decreased the number of its rooms.
Some have been combined into suites for the high rollers. 

Caesars has made a specialty of catering to high rollers from abroad, who are also being aggressively courted by the Mirage, the Las Vegas Hilton and others.
Other, smaller concerns are also pursuing market niches -- Hawaiian tourists, for example, or the local trade. "There's still room for boutique properties," says James Barrett, president of MarCor Resorts Inc. Off the Strip, MarCor is building the Rio, a hotel-casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites. 

Despite the proliferation of tourist distractions, Las Vegans haven't forgot that gambling is still what the town is all about. "The days when when the thrust of casinos was all high rollers, with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor, are gone," Mr. Sain of the visitors' bureau says. "But 93% of tourists still come for gambling.
We can't lose sight of that." 

PRIMERICA Corp., New York, raised its quarterly 14% to eight cents a share, from seven cents, payable Nov. 24 to stock of record Nov. 6.
The financial services company, which has about 98.8 million shares outstanding, noted its "continued confidence in the ongoing strength of the operations." 

George L. Manzanec, 53 years old, senior vice president of Texas Eastern Corp., was elected a group vice president of this natural-gas-pipeline concern.
Mr. Manzanec, who succeeds retiring Richard C. Dixon, will be responsible for gas supply, regulatory affairs, and marketing and transportation and exchange for Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., Trunkline Gas Co., Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.
All of the companies are units of Panhandle Eastern Corp., which acquired Texas Eastern Corp. earlier this year. 

The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements.
The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block, for up to 50 days, any bid for 15% or more of a U.S. airline, even a straight cash purchase.
Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner, who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U.S. carriers, now says the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets.
Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett, who has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district, says the bill is "good politics, but bad law." It is ironic that at a time when America's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from New Zealand to Ethiopia, so many in Congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline, Aeroflot. 

Bell Atlantic Corp. said it agreed definitively to acquire one of Control Data Corp. 's computer-maintenance businesses.
Terms of the accord weren't disclosed. 

Control Data's third-party maintenance unit services products primarily made by Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.
The unit has 6,000 customers and, according to one analyst, had 1988 revenue of about $85 million. 

Under the agreement, which had been widely expected, Bell Atlantic would be buying Control Data's customer base and its approximately 100 U.S. maintenance facilities in about 33 cities.
However, Control Data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its Cyber product line. 

The unit represents a small portion of Minneapolis-based Control Data's overall computer-servicing business, which last year posted sales of about $400 million.
Earlier this year, the company sold a similar unit in Europe for about $25 million. 

Lawrence Perlman, Control Data's president and chief operating officer, said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company's "strategy to be a data solutions company." 

Thomas Vassiliades, president of Bell Atlantic's customer services division, said the acquisition would give the company's Sorbus computer-maintenance unit added expertise in "the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies." 

National Convenience Stores Inc., trying to shake the doldrums in the convenience-store business, said it will rearrange the merchandise in all of its stores in the next 18 months to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores. 

As part of the plan, the Houston-based company's 1,100 Stop 'N Go stores will be refocused to target black, Hispanic, upscale or core middle-class customers.
Stores in upper-income neighborhoods, for instance, will carry high-priced wines, publications such as Vanity Fair, gourmet pasta sauces, oat bran cereals and Weight Watchers and Pritikin products.
Stores in Hispanic areas will stock an assortment of Spanish-language magazines, Mexican cooking items and candies.
Stores in the company's core middle-class market will get more frozen and quick-to-prepare foods and a greater selection of bottled water. 

V.H. Van Horn, National Convenience president and chief executive officer, said the move reflects the company's realization that the industry's poor performance stems from its failure to give customers what they want -- rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and 24-hour grocery stores. "Convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences," he said in a speech at the company's annual shareholders meeting. 

Analysts and competitors said the move reflects a growing need by the stores to expand their customer base beyond the traditional blue-collar worker who pops into a convenience store for a sandwich, cigarettes, soda or beer. 

"There are an increasing number of people out there who are time-poor," said Chris Vroom, retail analyst with Alex.
Brown & Sons of Baltimore. "Those are primarily white-collar workers, a customer segment that has historically proved elusive for convenience stores." 

National Convenience's move is likely to be echoed by other chains, though analysts note that Southland Corp., owner of 7-Eleven stores, and Circle K Corp. are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort.
Still, Southland said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years, and that the company has begun to follow suit. 

For instance, Southland has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh sandwiches in some outlets.
Several months ago, it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores, a spokeswoman said. "We certainly see an increasing trend toward that," she added. 

National Convenience said it has tested its new merchandise mix in 100 stores, with favorable results.
Analysts said the company's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put point-of-sale scanners in 200 stores, allowing National Convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that aren't. 

To promote its new strategy, National Convenience said it plans to spend about $12 million on advertising for the year ending June 30, up from about $10 million in fiscal 1989. 

Regarding your Oct. 4 page-one article "Bad Blood" on the generic-drug battle: The Epilepsy Institute is not just a patient-advocacy organization.
It is primarily a certified outpatient treatment facility providing comprehensive services to people with epilepsy and their families.
The institute's advocacy efforts are based on the needs of the population it serves and represents. 

In 1985, the Medical Tribune reported that a growing number of critics are challenging the FDA bioequivalence-therapeutic-equivalence equation. "They contend it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests," the Tribune said. 

In 1986, some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another.
In addition, neurologists were beginning to report these observations as well.
Call it anecdotal if you will.
But no ethical physician would switch patients who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point. 

We do not depend on pharmaceutical companies for our support.
The institute has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services; collects patient fees; receives money through contributions from individuals, foundations and bequests.
The funds received from pharmaceutical firms are used to offset physician symposiums, and these symposiums do not stress any particular medication or manufacturer. 

The Epilepsy Institute's reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people we treat and care about daily.
This perhaps was perceived as a "bold" stance, and thus suspicious.
But let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for people's health care or for the cost.
For whom is the saving?
Surely not to people with epilepsy who depend on the same levels of medication in their bloodstream daily to maintain seizure control.

Robert H. Knight's Oct. 5 editorial-page article bemoaning violence in comedy movies ("Hollywood, You Slay Me") is interesting, but somewhat off-base. 

As a fan of older movies from the 1920s on, I do not find modern comedies contain violence, sex and foul language to any greater degree than other recent movies.
Older movies have plenty of violence, though it is portrayed in keeping with the more restrictive social conventions of the time.
For example, one of my favorite movies is the 1949 British comedy "Kind Hearts and Coronets," in which the entire comedy is based on actor Dennis Price's murdering eight titled relatives (all played by Alec Guinness) because they snubbed his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title.
Similarly, one of the most popular comedy genres of the 1930s and '40s was the "murder mystery/ comedy." The "Thin Man" series of movies, as well as many others, based their entire comedic appeal on the star detectives' witty quips and puns as other characters in the movies were murdered. 

Further, I think Mr. Knight made a poor choice in picking "A Fish Called Wanda" as an example of the deplorable state of modern comedy movies.
The specific scene he mentions in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat reminiscent of the continual plights that befall the coyote in the old Warner Bros. "Road Runner" cartoons.
There is no slow-motion close-up, blood-and-guts portrayal of the animal's demise.
Keep in mind that this is the same movie in which a character is flattened by a steamroller only to pop right back up and peer in the window of a Boeing 747 -- from the outside -- as it takes off. 

I will be the first to agree that there is much to be found wrong with modern movie making.
Many modern scriptwriters seem to be incapable of writing drama, or anything else, without foul-mouthed cursing.
Sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant to the script, and high-tech special effects are continually substituted for good plot and character development.
In short, we have a movie and television industry that is either incapable or petrified of making a movie unless it carries a PG-13 or R rating.
Hence copious amounts of gratuitous sex, violence and gutter language are included as a crutch.
However, these faults are not the exclusive property of modern comedies, and I believe Mr. Knight errs when he attempts to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making.

Two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and biography.
These decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars, and from journalists as well. 

Russell Miller's "Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard" is a biography of the founder of the Church of Scientology.
Mr. Hubbard, who died in 1986, bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church, which licensed them to New Era Publications, a Danish corporation.
In 1988 New Era sought a permanent injunction to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from publishing "Bare-Faced Messiah" on the ground that Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard infringed the copyrights.
The publisher argued in response that the "fair use" statute permits quotation "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, . . . scholarship, or research." 

District Court Judge Pierre Leval denied the injunction on the ground that New Era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine lawyers call "laches." As for the merits, Judge Leval said that Mr. Miller had written "a serious book of responsible historical criticism." Verbatim quotation, the judge believed, was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about Mr. Hubbard -- mendacity, bigotry, paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. Hubbard's own words. "The biographer/critic," Judge Leval wrote, "should not be required simply to express . . . conclusions without defending them by example." In such circumstances, free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner. 

But Judge Leval felt constrained by an earlier decision of the Second Circuit Court forbidding a biographer of J.D. Salinger to quote from Mr. Salinger's personal letters.
He distinguished the two cases: In Salinger, Judge Leval noted, the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject.
Still the Salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials.
Judge Leval reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard's unpublished writings, because they were not necessary to prove historical points, failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright.
But the proper remedy, Judge Leval said, lay in a suit for damages, not in an injunction. 

The case went on appeal to the Second Circuit.
In a decision in April of this year, Judge Roger Miner, joined by Judge Frank Altimari, agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that "Bare-Faced Messiah" was a serious work but rejected Judge Leval's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright. "We conclude," the two judges wrote, "that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction." Had the suit been filed in time, they said, "Bare-Faced Messiah" would have been suppressed. 

This was too much for James Oakes, the court's chief judge.
In a powerful separate opinion, Judge Oakes further distinguished the Salinger case by pointing out that a living person, like Mr. Salinger, had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man, like Mr. Hubbard. "I thought that Salinger might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us.
This case realizes that concern." 

Decisions by the Second Circuit itself, Judge Oakes continued, had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use.
And the injunction Judges Miner and Altimari would so readily have granted had New Era sued in time?
Suppression of the book, Judge Oakes observed, would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the First Amendment. 

Moreover, and here Judge Oakes went to the heart of the question, "Responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources, letters, diaries, and memoranda.
Indeed, it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information." 

Now, scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation.
And of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers, whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to libraries.
But in the "Bare-Faced Messiah" case the author found most of his material in court records or via the Freedom of Information Act.
And when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials, copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points. 

Judges Oakes and Leval understand the requirements of historical scholarship.
Judges Miner and Altimari do not appear to have a clue.
Yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law.
As matters stand, the Salinger ruling, torn from context and broadly construed, is controlling.
If an author quotes "more than minimal amounts" of unpublished copyrighted materials, as the Salinger decision had it, "he deserves to be enjoined." The courts have not defined "minimal amounts," but publishers, I understand, take it to mean about 50 words.
The "Bare-Faced Messiah" decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise.
A second decision, handed down in August by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is another blow against scholarship.
Janet Malcolm, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the New Yorker, later published in book form by Knopf under the title "In the Freud Archives." The articles were largely based on interviews Ms. Malcolm had taped with Jeffrey Masson, a psychoanalyst who had served as projects director of the Freud Archives. 

Mr. Masson then brought a libel suit against Ms. Malcolm, the New Yorker and Knopf.
As a public figure, Mr. Masson had to prove malice and, as proof of malice, Mr. Masson contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by Ms. Malcolm were in fact fabricated.
The quotes could not be found on the tapes, and the two judges who decided the case for Ms. Malcolm and her publishers conceded that, for the purpose of their decision, "we assume the quotations were deliberately altered." 

For all historians and most journalists, this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the Malcolm articles.
But Judge Arthur Alarcon, joined by Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall, took the astonishing position that it is perfectly OK to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks. 

In his eloquent dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski observed that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said, the reader assumes that these are the speaker's precise words or at least his words purged of "uh" and "you know" and grammatical error.
While judges have an obligation under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of the press, "the right to deliberately alter quotations is not, in my view, a concomitant of a free press." 

Ms. Malcolm, for example, wrote that Mr. Masson described himself as "the greatest analyst who ever lived." No such statement appears on the tapes.
The majority cited Mr. Masson's remark "It's me alone . . . against the rest of the analytic world" as warrant for the Malcolm fabrication.
But, as Judge Kozinski noted, the context shows that Mr. Masson's "me alone" remark referred not to his alleged pre-eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else. 

Ms. Malcolm had Mr. Masson describing himself as "an intellectual gigolo." Again, no such statement appears on the tapes.
The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson's description of himself as a "private asset but a public liability" to Anna Freud and that in any case it was not defamatory.
Judge Kozinski found the derivation entirely strained and writes that "for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is . . . a devastating admission of professional dishonesty." 

These were only two of a series of fabrications that had, in Judge Kozinski's words, the cumulative effect of making Mr. Masson "appear more arrogant, less sensitive, shallower, more self-aggrandizing, and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements." As Robert Coles wrote in a review of Ms. Malcolm's book, Mr. Masson emerges "as a grandiose egotist . . . and, in the end, a self-destructive fool.
But it is not Janet Malcolm who calls him such: his own words reveal this psychological profile." We now know that the words were not always his own. 

"There is one sacred rule of journalism," John Hersey has said. "The writer must not invent." Should the green light Judges Alarcon and Hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice, it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians -- and for citizens.
As Judge Kozinski put it: "To invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else has said is to assert the right to lie in print. . . . Masson has lost his case, but the defendants, and the profession to which they belong, have lost far more." 

The historical profession will survive these decisions.

Canadian manufacturers recorded a 0.8% decline in August in their backlog of unfilled orders, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said. 

The August drop was the fourth decline in five months.
Most of the August decrease was attributed to lower order backlogs in the primary metal and electric and electronics-product industries. 

Manufacturers' shipments rose 0.3% in August following two months of declines.
Inventories fell 0.3% in August. 

"Parenthood," this summer's successful and amusing movie about parents and children, apparently was only the beginning.
It seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother's death, or adoption, or aging parents, or pregnancy.
And why not?
Some of our best and most idiosyncratic film makers -- from Truffaut to Fellini to Woody Allen -- have taken a cue from Chekhov: When it comes to compelling drama, there's no place like home. 

Yet too many people working in Hollywood today seem to suffer from the delusion that the drama played out in every home will be interesting to people who live somewhere else.
This is not the case.
Some diaries simply aren't worth snooping in. 

Yet there will be people who will sob at "Immediate Family," a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption.
These are the sensitive souls who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other people's troubles, no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told. 

Written by Barbara Benedek, co-author of "The Big Chill," "Immediate Family" takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children.
The film makers have couched this offensive idea in pretty packaging.
Everyone is very nice and good-looking -- the adoptive parents (Glenn Close and James Woods) and the teen-age couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption (Mary Stuart Masterson and Kevin Dillon). 

Linda and Michael (Ms.
Close and Mr. Woods), who seem to be pushing 40, live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban Seattle.
All of their friends have children and they can't, so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment.
The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them, since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats, in therapy by age five. 

Having exhausted all modern aids to fertility, Linda and Michael decide to adopt.
The actors wear pained expressions to indicate their genuine longing for a little one -- or maybe they're not-so-subtly commenting on the inadequacy of the script, and Jonathan Kaplan's ("The Accused") dull direction.
Or maybe they are disgusted by the literal-minded musical score; when a character arrives at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of "I Can See Clearly Now." The adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother, so Linda and Michael pay for pregnant Lucy's (Ms.
Masterson) bus ticket from Ohio. (Why in these movies is the unwed pregnant woman always from Ohio?
I ask this not necessarily as a native Ohioan.) Lucy, of course, is pretty and smart, though uneducated.
Everyone falls in love with everyone else.
There is some pain, when Lucy has the baby and "didn't know she would feel like this" and wants to keep the baby.
But in the end, everything turns out for the best, in the film makers' warped view.
Like lawyers in the hostile takeover field, the baby goes where the money is. 

At the other end of the life cycle is "Dad," Gary David Goldberg's adaptation of the William Wharton novel.
This picture is about a middle-aged son who makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old man dies. 

The glib emotional style Mr. Goldberg has perfected on television's "Family Ties" doesn't benefit from magnification.
His characters practically scamper through a vast range of human emotions, like travelers doing 10 cities in eight days.
They pause only to register little whimpers of distress and sighs of satisfaction, like tourists cataloging the sights they've seen from the window of a bus.
Not even Jack Lemmon's expert doddering makes this trip worth taking. 

So it's entirely possible that "Look Who's Talking" isn't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the turgid other films opening now.
But by comparison, this fluffy comedy seems like a gem.
It starts with conception, taking the sperm's point of view, then progresses to the baby's point of view.
Bruce Willis's best attribute as an actor is his coy, lazy voice, and that's all you get of him here, speaking for the baby. 

Finally, there is one family movie that quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion -- only its stars are bears.
For the second time, in a movie called "The Bear," French director Jean-Jacques Annaud demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be. ("Quest for Fire" was the first time.) To be sure, one wonders what kind of man is this, who feels compelled to try to understand the most primitive longing and instinct in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of visual storytelling.
Supposedly, he proposed the movie to his producer, Claude Berri, in four lines: "An orphan bear cub.
A big solitary bear.
Two hunters in the forest.
The animals' point of view." 

But then, even a great many words couldn't summarize the extraordinary pull of this movie about an orphaned bear who adopts a parent. 

Video Tip: One of the best movies about the child-parent thing in recent years was "Raising Arizona," the 1987 Coen brothers' comedy that definitely was not about the folks next door. 

Computer Sciences Corp. said it received a U.S. Postal Service contract that will have a value of at least $33 million. 

Computer Sciences will perform data processing work for the Postal Service under the three-year contract, which also includes two additional option years for which compensation hasn't yet been fixed.
Computer Sciences said its work will improve mail-processing efficiency. 

For its fiscal year ended March 31, Computer Sciences had revenue of $1.3 billion. 

Du Pont Co. reported that third-quarter profit grew a robust 19% from a year ago on the strength of the company's operations in various chemicals and fibers, and in petroleum. 

Du Pont also raised its quarterly dividend to $1.20 a share from $1.05, a change that will increase the annualized payout to shareholders by some $140 million. 

Du Pont, unlike companies hurt badly by sharp price declines for basic chemicals and plastics, is benefiting from its broad range of businesses.
The profit gain was made despite a weakening in the housing market, for which the company is a supplier, and a strengthening in the dollar, which lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars. 

The Wilmington, Del., company reported net of $547 million, or $2.36 a share, which was in line with Wall Street estimates.
In the year-earlier period, the company earned $461 million, or $1.91 a share.
Sales in the latest quarter were $8.59 billion, up 9.4% from $7.85 billion. 

The dividend increase was Du Pont's second this year, an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders. "We haven't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to," said Edgar Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April. 

The largest beneficiary will be Seagram Co., which owns about 23% of Du Pont.
A spokesman for Seagram, the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family, said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $33 million a year because of the additional Du Pont dividends. 

Du Pont also announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split, although the initial higher dividend will be paid on pre-split shares.
Du Pont's stock rose $2.50 a share to close at $117.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
Seagram closed at $84.75, up 12.5 cents a share in Big Board trading. 

Leading the gains for Du Pont in the latest quarter was its industrial products segment, where profit soared to $155 million from $99 million a year earlier.
The company benefited from continued strong demand and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide, a white pigment used in paints, paper and plastics. 

James Fallon, a New Providence, N.J., marketing consultant to the chemicals industry, says Du Pont still holds an edge in making the pigment because the company was "first in with the technology" to lower costs.
He said Du Pont holds about 23% of the world-wide market, the largest single share, at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply, although others are now adding low-cost production capacity. 

Profit climbed to $98 million from $71 million in the petroleum segment, as Du Pont's Conoco Inc. oil company was helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume. 

In the diversifed businesses segment, which includes herbicides, profit grew to $64 million from $27 million.
A spokesman said herbicide use in some areas of the U.S. was delayed earlier in the year by heavy rains, thus increasing sales in the third quarter. 

In the fibers segment, profit rose to $180 million from $155 million, a gain Du Pont attributed to higher demand in the U.S. for most textile products. 

Two segments posted lower earnings for the quarter.
Profit from coal fell to $41 million from $58 million, partly because of a miners' strike.
And profit from polymers dropped to $107 million from $122 million amid what Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets. 

For the nine months, Du Pont earned $2 billion, or $8.46 a share, up 18% from $1.69 billion, or $7.03 a share, a year earlier.
Sales increased 10% to $26.54 billion from $24.05 billion. 

The increased dividend will be paid Dec. 14 to holders of record Nov. 15.
The stock split, which is subject to holder approval, would be paid on a still unspecified date in January to holders of record Dec. 21. 

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that the Fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession, but he said doing so will inflict some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply. 

Mr. Greenspan said he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.) that would require the Fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years. "Such a deadline is attainable, but it would have costs," Mr. Greenspan told Rep. Neal's monetary policy subcommittee. 

The Fed chief opposed a bill-introduced by Reps.
Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) and Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) -- that, among other things, would require the Fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed. 

In responding to questions, Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange-rate policy. 

"What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics," he said.
He didn't elaborate.
But the Fed isn't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets, and the Treasury is frustrated at the Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar's value. 

Mr. Greenspan said the inflation rate, currently about 4 1/2%, "could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession, but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output." In other words, economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years.
But Mr. Greenspan, who has repeatedly said the Fed's goal is to reduce inflation, added that "whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter." 

He warned that Fed efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce "a major financial crunch" -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit, which causes the government to borrow heavily. 

Rep. Neal's bill originally called on the Fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter.
He altered the wording to win Mr. Greenspan's endorsement.
Even so, his bill is given little chance of passage. 

Reps.
Hamilton and Dorgan also have altered their bill, dropping a proposal to add the Treasury secretary to the 12-member Fed committee that makes monetary policy.
Instead, the bill simply calls for twice-a-year meetings between the committee and top administration officials. 

Even that met with Mr. Greenspan's disapproval because it might subject the Fed "to a more intensely political perspective" and "could risk bending monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals." 

While each of the Hamilton-Dorgan proposals represents only a small step, together they would erode the Fed's independence, Mr. Greenspan said. 

Mr. Greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy, he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and result in higher marginal income tax rates.

One of the more bizarre garden stories since Eden has been unfolding for four years now, in the private paper-and-crayon fantasies of artist Jennifer Bartlett.
And if she and the Battery Park City Authority have their way, her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden "artwork" in the downtown complex. 

South Gardens, as the Bartlett scheme is called, will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of Manhattan.
It could cost taxpayers $15 million to install and BPC residents $1 million a year to maintain.
Created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of plants and gardens, South Gardens, as now planned, will die from congestive garden design. 

Ms. Bartlett's previous work, which earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world, often took gardens as its nominal subject.
Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the BPC Fine Arts Committee think she had a literal green thumb. (Ms.
Bartlett would not discuss her garden for this article.) 

Last year she boasted to HG magazine: "I'd never looked at a garden in my life." And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the BPCA, a New York State public benefit corporation: "The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden, which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain." 

Undeterred, the BPCA hired Ms. Bartlett and another confessed garden ignoramus, the architect Alexander Cooper, who claimed he had never visited, much less built, a garden, and said of the project, "I don't view this as a landscape.
I view this as a building." The third principal in the South Gardens adventure did have garden experience.
The firm of Bruce Kelly/David Varnell Landscape Architects had created Central Park's Strawberry Fields and Shakespeare Garden.
The BPCA called its team a "stunning" collaboration. 

After four years, though, the South Gardens design is 100% uncollaborated Jennifer Bartlett.
She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees, water, landscape fragments, rudimentary square houses, circles, triangles, rectangles -- and fit them into a grid, as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall.
But for South Gardens, the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them.
In a letter to the BPCA, kelly/varnell called this "arbitrary and amateurish." The landscape architects were expelled from the garden in July. 

All the while, Ms. Bartlett had been busy at her assignment, serene in her sense of self-tilth.
As she put it in a 1987 lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design: "I have designed a garden, not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip." Moreover, she proclaimed that "landscape architects have been going wrong for the last 20 years" in the design of open space.
And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method: Commissioning a friend to spend "five or six thousand dollars . . . on books that I ultimately cut up." After that, the layout had been easy. "I've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail." Ms. Bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client "because I don't think you can do watered-down versions of things." (This was never a problem with South Gardens, because the client had long since given in to Ms. Bartlett's every whim.) 

Last year the public was afforded a preview of Ms. Bartlett's creation in a tablemodel version, at a BPC exhibition.
The labels were breathy: "Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design . . . a rose garden, herb garden, serpentine garden, flower fields, an apple orchard . . . organized in a patchwork of 50-by-50-foot squares to form `rooms' . . . here and there are simple architectural forms, a whimsical jet of water, a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid, and chairs of every sort to drag around. . . . At the core of it all is a love for plants." 

Plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed.
They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly.
Ms. Bartlett's little rooms left little room for plants or people.
Kelly/Varnell had put South Gardens' carrying capacity at four people per room, or about 100 humans overall.
This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist's own digs: "My loft was 50 by 100 feet, so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room." 

Inside the grid were 24 of these plant cells jammed full of clutter.
One she made into a topiary rec room, replete with plants shaped into a Barcalounger, TV, piano and chairs.
In another, she requisitioned topiary MX missile cones -- costing $10,000 each -- in heights up to 20 feet.
Another she stuffed with eight "rectilinear hedges" for a topiary geometry lesson in the right-angling of plants.
In the herbal lounge she specified a "plaid knot garden" decor.
She ordered the foyer done in a different plaid planting, and made the landscape architects study a book on tartans. 

In one garden roomette she implanted a 43-foot square glass cube meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit, a "zinc sink," a "huge fishbowl with carp" and a "birdcage with cockatoos." Next door she put a smaller plaid-floored glass house, where, she suggested, a flat of strawberries might be displayed in the dead of winter. 

In another compartment called the Linden Bosque, 62 linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of 10 or 16 feet. (Lindens need about 36 feet.) 

One thing about the Bartlett plan was never in doubt: It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers, rosarians, orchardists and arborists.
Ms. Bartlett blithely suggested calling upon "semi-skilled garden club workers for maintenance." Furthermore, she had insisted on paths so narrow (five to eight feet) and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment -- trucks or cherry pickers -- couldn't maneuver. 

Then, to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms, Ms. Bartlett had thrown up windowless walls (brick, lattice, hedge) eight to 10 feet tall, casting her interiors into day-long Stygian shade.
It was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in South Gardens without decking the walls in a Christmas-like array of Gro-Lites. 

Finally, flouting the BPCA's wishes to continue the popular two-mile riverside Esplanade, prized for its expansive views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, Ms. Bartlett threw up yet another wall, this time concrete, this time 10 1/2 feet tall.
She ran it the length of the South Gardens riverfront, blotting out the city's great natural water features, the harbor and the river. (Within her garden, she has decreed a waterfall, a rill, ponds and other costly, trivial waterworks beside the Hudson.) 

While the model was still on view, Manhattan Community Board 1 passed a resolution against South Gardens.
The Parks Council wrote the BPCA that this "too `private' . . . exclusive," complex and expensive "enclosed garden . . . belongs in almost any location but the waterfront." Lynden B. Miller, the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park's Conservatory Garden, recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street's Bryant Park: "Bryant Park, as designed in 1933, failed as a public space, because it made people feel trapped.
By removing the hedges and some walls, the Bryant Park Restoration is opening it up.
It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants." 

The three urban horticulture experts with Cornell Cooperative Extension weighed in with a letter to the BPCA that began: "We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed." They then addressed the decidedly "questionable safety of . . . a complex garden of endless hiding places.
The 8 ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small `rooms' insure . . . that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime." (At Harvard, Ms. Bartlett had declared: "There are going to be problems with safety . . . I'm not going to address questions of safety!") 

Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals, Ms. Bartlett's South Gardens design somehow continues on, seemingly impervious to reason, stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications.
BPCA President and CEO David Emil hopes to negotiate a seawall that could "be significantly more visually permeable." And by substituting yet another landscape architect, Nicholas Quennell, he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the "artistic vision" of a "truly great artist." After four years of no progress in this direction, it is doubtful any viable collaboration with Ms. Bartlett will suddenly now be possible. (Mr.
Quennell has said he plans to go with the grid, regardless.) There is still time, however, for Gov. Mario Cuomo or Fabian Palomino, chairman of the BPCA board, to prevent this topiary "Tilted Arc." 

These statesmen might take counsel from William Robinson, author of "The English Flower Garden" -- the gardener's bible since 1883 -- who seems to have had a Jennifer Bartlett in mind when he wrote: "Unhappily, our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his `designs' to the garden. . . . It is this adapting of absurd `knots' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants." 

International Business Machines Corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of Eastman Kodak Co. 's data-processing needs.
But the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with Kodak to archrival Digital Equipment Corp. 

Kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with Maynard, Mass.-based Digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs.
Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., said IBM also had bid for the business.
IBM is based in Armonk, N.Y. 

The loss is a setback to IBM, which pointed to the Kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration.
That's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations. 

A Kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract, which is still in negotiation.
He said that American Telephone & Telegraph, MCI Communications Corp., Rochester Telephone Corp. and IBM itself would likely be Digital's subcontractors on the project. 

"When we decided to look outside the company for critical data-processing and communications services, we wanted to get the best vendor for that service," said Paul Allen, the spokesman. "That's why we went with IBM for data center management . . . and now Digital for voice and data telecommunications." 

American Medical International Inc. was dropped from the health care providers industry group of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index.
The company is being acquired. 

U.S. Healthcare Inc. was added to the health care providers group.
Both moves are effective today. 

Duriron Co. said it has agreed to buy Automax Inc., a Cincinnati maker of control accessories for industrial valves. 

Terms weren't disclosed, but Duriron said the deal will be completed through an exchange of stock. 

Closely held Automax has annual sales of about $10 million.
Duriron, a maker of pumps, valves and other controls, said the acquisition won't impact its 1989 profit. 

The Soviet State Bank announced a 90% devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions, in an apparent attempt to curb the nation's rapidly growing black market for hard currency. 

The measure, which will take effect next Wednesday, will create a two-tier exchange rate.
Commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar.
But for Soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism, the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar. 

Tass news agency said the devaluation also will apply to foreigners' transactions.
But it didn't elaborate, and it remains unclear how far Western tourists and foreigners living in Moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut. 

The current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market.
As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade, the discrepancy has become ever greater.
Western tourists in the Soviet Union who could exchange a dollar -- albeit illegally -- for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered 15 rubles or more. 

Even at such rates, black marketeers have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here.
They use dollars to buy Western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark-up.
The going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $2,000 in the West is anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 rubles.
Even a pack of 20 Western cigarettes can fetch 20 rubles or more.
With more than 300 billion rubles in savings accounts and little to spend them on, Soviet consumers grumble at the exorbitant black-market prices for such goods -- but they buy them anyway. 

Moscow has already tacitly admitted that the ruble isn't worth much, announcing in August that it will pay Soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of state-plan quotas. 

"The absurdity of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone," the afternoon newspaper Izvestia wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation. 

The State Bank's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as Moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that Soviet bankers and economists say is still far away.
Rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in Moscow for weeks, but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise. "It's much bigger than we expected," said one German banker, who asked not to be named. 

The next step, which could have a larger effect on businesses, will come early next month, when the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign currency.
Soviet companies needing Western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids. 

Plans for the auction, which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event, have been thwarted by a lack of hard currency.
Soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it, and joint ventures aren't yet allowed to participate.
The Kremlin also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction, using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods. 

If foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new, better exchange rate, that would enable the State Bank to increase its dollar reserves and would mop up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time.
But the amounts they exchange may be limited; most Soviet hotels, for example, demand payment in hard currency from Western visitors. 

Unless other rules are changed, the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help: Soviets who travel abroad.
Over the past three years, thousands of people here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad. 

But under current rules, they are allowed to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip.
At the new rate, that would give them about $30 to travel on.
It isn't yet clear whether the 200-ruble limit will be lifted.
If it isn't, the black market for dollars probably will continue to thrive.

President Bush told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line-item veto.
Vice President Quayle and Budget Director Darman said recently they've joined the search.
On Tuesday, the subject came up again when Marlin Fitzwater explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the White House press corps. 

President Bush doesn't have any provision in mind, but line-item-veto bait will be like earthworms at midnight in the coming Continuing Resolution.
The harder question is whether anyone yet understands that Mr. Bush's fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law. 

We have been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line-item veto since 1987, when lawyer Stephen Glazier first made the case on this page.
The 1974 budget "reform," passed over President Nixon's veto, took away the presidential impoundment power, thereby introducing monstrous CRs and eviscerating the presidential veto. 

Mr. Glazier discovered that the Founders had worried that Congress might take the President out of the loop.
Article I, Section 7, Clause 3 says that whether it's called an "order, resolution or vote" or anything else, Presidents must have the chance to veto.
Labeling an omnibus budget a "bill" can't deprive the President of his power to veto items. 

Finding a test case shouldn't be hard, but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible.
The White House had the perfect case, but Congress blinked before it could go to court.
After the HUD and S&L stories broke, some Congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble.
They worried about an Interior Department directive to log all communications with Members or their staffs.
Congress inserted the following into the Interior appropriation: "None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the Dept. of the Interior and Members and committees of Congress and their staff." 

The White House warned that this would be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power.
When it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto, Congress caved.
The fear Congress has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year, "This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1, 1989." This means Interior contacts cannot be logged only on one day -- a Sunday that had already passed. 

If the White House is looking for another unconstitutional bill, Rep. John Dingell is trying again to raise the Fairness Doctrine from the dead.
President Reagan vetoed this as a First Amendment violation.
The "Fairness" Doctrine's enthusiasts are incumbents in the House who know the rules squelch lively discussions on broadcasts, deterring feisty challengers.
There are also other provisions requiring Congressmen to join treaty-negotiating teams and new restrictions on OMB. 

Unconstitutional bills make good legal targets, but the line-item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere fodder for lawyers.
Commenting on the budget mess this week, President Bush said: "The perception out there is that it's the fault of Congress.
And you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the American people." Exactly right.
Now's the time to make the political case that Presidents need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget. 

Congress is in no position to naysay Mr. Bush now that we're into Gramm-Rudman's sequestration.
Just this week, the House-Senate conference met -- 231 conferees, divided into 26 different subconferences.
Senator Daniel Inouye agreed to close some bases in Hawaii in exchange for such goodies as $11 million for a parking lot at Walter Reed Hospital.
Conference negotiator Rep. Bill Hefner pulled down $40 million in military bases for North Carolina and graciously allowed Senator James Sasser $70 million for bases in Tennessee.
President Bush should take the Constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work.
He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork.
Congress may have lost any sense of discipline, but that doesn't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess.
President Bush has the power to change how Washington works, if only he will use it. 

The White House has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation's food supply. 

The proposed changes, which are scheduled to be announced today, would apply to pesticides and other substances found on fresh and processed foods, according to federal officials.
Environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal. 

But they are already objecting to, among other things, a plan to give more weight to cost-benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides."It's a tremendous disappointment," said Janet Hathaway, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Allowing the EPA to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community." 

The Bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them.
The principles would give the Environmental Protection Agency increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides, with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly.
There already are proposals pending in Congress to overhaul pesticide law. 

Moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year's Alar scare, when the EPA was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible carcinogen, a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier.
The agency has since acted to remove Alar from the nation's grocery shelves by May 31, 1991, and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical. 

In addition, the principles attempt to eliminate the so-called Delaney Paradox.
Under the Delaney clause, which applies to processed food, a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals.
Under other laws applying to pesticide use, however, that same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it fell within the EPA's tolerance level. 

Among other changes, the White House wants to: 

-- Give the EPA more flexibility to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace. 

-- Speed up the process for removing a pesticide that isn't an imminent hazard. 

-- Bar states from setting more stringent tolerance levels for a pesticide once the federal government has set a standard. 

-- Give the EPA added discretion to set "negligible risk" levels for pesticide residues in processed food.
Chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred, but those that fall below these levels would be allowed. 

-- Allow the EPA to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost. 

Richard Breeden hadn't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone.
It was, after all, only his second full day as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

But the lack of lines became painfully apparent.
As the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13, Mr. Breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the SEC -- from his desk, where the New York Stock Exchange was on an open line, to his assistant's office, where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was connected, to a third room, where a computer monitored market moves.
With other anxious calls pouring in, he recalls, "I'd either have to disconnect the New York Stock Exchange or go out to the secretary's desk." 

It won't happen again.
Now there are more lines connected to the chairman's office, and the market-monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk.
It's all part of a new "command center." 

The changes in the office layout illustrate Mr. Breeden's stance as the nation's top securities regulator.
Like his predecessor, David Ruder, he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office. 

But unlike Mr. Ruder, who during the 1987 crash damaged himself by saying rather offhandedly that the markets might be closed, Mr. Breeden is turning the market drop to his own advantage, using it to further his agenda for the SEC. 

In an interview and in congressional testimony, he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for Congress to give the SEC the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market.
A veteran of another financial crisis, the savings-and-loan bailout, Mr. Breeden wants to have the SEC regulate securities issued by banks and S&Ls. 

More broadly, he wants to "modernize" regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping U.S. financial firms compete in the global market.
He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs, an area the SEC doesn't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in Congress. 

Also unlike Mr. Ruder, Mr. Breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda.
As a former White House aide who worked closely with Congress, he is savvy in the ways of Washington.
What's more, the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the five-member commission, enabling him to avoid the dissension that frustrated his predecessor. 

But Mr. Breeden, a 39-year-old securities lawyer, has skirted some of the heftier issues facing the financial markets.
For instance, he hasn't stated a clear position on high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks.
He may be waiting to see the results of several pending SEC studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules. 

He also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission, a job vacant since the summer.
Mr. Breeden's selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the SEC's high-profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on Wall Street. 

Congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while.
Members of the Senate Banking Committee know Mr. Breeden from working on the thrift-bailout bill, and the relationship generally remains warm.
Indeed, during Mr. Breeden's confirmation hearing last month, senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times -- more often than they asked about his qualifications for the job. 

These days, Mr. Breeden is winning praise in Washington and on Wall Street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the Friday-the-13th market plunge and the following Monday's harrowing morning session.
As a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence, Mr. Breeden avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to Wall Street and to other government agencies. 

Not everyone has jumped on the Breeden bandwagon, however.
Some in Washington contend that it's too soon to tell whether Mr. Breeden will help or hinder the SEC. "I don't think this was a real test," says one congressional aide. "It was a fairly stressful weekend, but my sense is if you hadn't had Richard Breeden there, it wouldn't have made much of a difference." 

For some at the SEC, an agency that covets its independence, Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider.
They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of George Bush, one of them featuring the First Dog, Millie.
They worry that Mr. Breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the White House.
But Mr. Breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the SEC his way.
During the Monday market rebound, a New York exchange spokesman told Cable News Network viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points.
Stunned, Mr. Breeden turned to his market-monitoring computer, which by then was next to his desk.
It showed the DJIA up 30 points. 

SEC staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service, Quotron, had miscalculated the industrial average.
Mr. Breeden instructed SEC staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number. "It was the plunge that didn't happen," he says. 

Mr. Breeden also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event -- the California earthquake -- to move another rule change past Congress.
That disaster closed the Pacific Stock Exchange's stock options-trading operation, forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily. 

Though obscure to most investors, the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress, mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them. 

Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing.
Mr. Breeden, not missing a chance to press his agenda, cited the earthquake.
That event, he contended, simply shows the "vulnerability" of having listings on only one exchange. 

Diversified Investment Group Inc. said it agreed to be acquired by Star States Corp. for stock valued at $13.75 a share, or about $24.4 million. 

Diversified, the holding company for Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan Association, said the agreement also gives Star States the option to acquire 588,300 of Diversified's 1,774,326 shares outstanding "under certain circumstances." 

The acquisition would give Wilmington, Del.-based Star States access to the Pennsylvania market. 

The agreement is subject to regulatory approval and resolution of lawsuits brought by certain Diversified holders in connection with the proposed merger. 

Total Assets Protection Inc., rebounding from its earlier loss, expects to report earnings from operations of about $200,000 for the third quarter, J.C. Matlock, chairman, said. 

Net income includes an extraordinary gain of about $100,000 from the reversal of bad debt and interest income.
Revenue was about $4.5 million.
In the 1988 third quarter, the company posted a net loss of $876,706, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of about $5.1 million. 

Total Assets plans and designs computer centers, computer security systems and computer backup systems.

Office Market Weakens 

In Overbuilt Northeast 

THE NORTHEAST office market is feeling serious aftereffects of the giddy overbuilding of the 1980s. 

Foreclosures and other signs of financial distress, most often associated with the real estate market in the Southwest, are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving Northeast. 

Some projects are now in the hands of lenders, including a 425,000-square-foot office facility in Little Falls, N.J.
The owners of a 32-acre hotel and office complex in King of Prussia, Pa., have advertised for new financing.
Rising office vacancy rates in Fairfield County, Conn., have builders and bankers scrambling to restructure loans.
And in suburban Boston, developers are bracing for cutbacks in the computer industry, a major user of office space. 

Many troubled properties haven't been foreclosed on and are hard to identify, says Albert I. Berger, who heads the Secaucus, N.J., office of Helmsley-Spear Inc., a real estate brokerage.
Owners are voluntarily -- and quietly -- turning over properties to lenders through "deeds in lieu of foreclosure." Often, developers stay on as property manager. 

Real estate analyst Lloyd Lynford says the Northeast's distress is masked by relatively low vacancy rates.
But in today's overbuilt market, tenants have many choices and are negotiating low rents that squeeze building owners.
On average, Mr. Lynford says, it now takes three to 3 1/2 years to fill new office space, compared with 2 1/2 years in 1988. 

Beverly Hills Comes 

To Suburban Tokyo 

WHY SHOULD the Japanese cross the Pacific to buy American real estate when they can simply recreate it at home? 

Tokyu Development Corp. is spending $500 million to build American-style luxury homes in suburban Tokyo with rarely seen back yards, front yards, swimming pools and tennis courts. 

The Japanese company hired Richardson Nagy Martin, a Newport Beach, Calif., architectural firm, to design what the Japanese press has dubbed "the Beverly Hills of Tokyo." Instead of Japan's typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks, the new "One Hundred Hills" development will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots.
That's more than 10 times the usual housing site size. 

Buyers with $6 million to spend can select from 11 designs, including a Mediterranean-inspired California style, a traditional Yankee look and designs inspired by Midwestern architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
There are spacious living rooms and baths, plus a master grandparents suite and a foyer for removing shoes to suit Japanese life styles. 

Exteriors are faced with brick, wood or stone, but the homes are made of steel-reinforced concrete. "We were disappointed we couldn't use wood," says architect Walter J. Richardson, "but the Japanese only want stronger materials." At $1,000 per square foot, the Japanese want the feeling of indestructibility, he explains, not to mention protection from possible earthquake damage. 

Housing Developers Try 

Brand-Name Buildings 

RESIDENTIAL builders, faced with a more competitive market, are turning to a traditional consumer marketing technique to establish brand-name identity. 

"One of the difficulties people in real estate have is that each product is like starting a new company, or starting a new line in the fashion business," says L. Robert Lieb president of Mountain Development Corp. in West Paterson, N.J.
So he's using "river" in many project names. "It'll never be like what Bristol-Myers does," he adds, "but it helps establish recognition with the public -- and with banks." 

Weingarten-Siegel Group Inc. of Manalapan, N.J., has built Cross Creek Pointe, Allegro Pointe and other Pointes in New Jersey.
Caspi Development Corp of Armonk, N.Y., has developed two apartment buildings called Classic and plans a third.
Developer Steve Caspi says the same brand name indicates consistent quality, "regardless of location, design or amenities." 

The leader in real estate brand names is developer Ara Hovnanian.
His entry-price condos are labeled Society Hill.
Beacon Hill is for "move-up" town houses, and Nob Hill, for single-family houses.
Because of standardized designs, Mr. Hovnanian says, "a buyer can visualize Society Hill regardless of where it is." 

Quake Not Likely to Jolt 

The Commercial Market 

THE EARTHQUAKE in San Francisco has sent few tremors through the hearts of real estate investors. 

"I think there's a disease called buyer's regret, and I'm sure it's running rampant at this moment, but it gets cured in a short period of time," says Kenneth Leventhal, co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Co,. a Los Angeles accounting firm specializing in real estate. "If I were buying a building in San Francisco now the first thing I'd do is insist on a structural inspection, then I'd delay a little, stall a little." 

But like other real estate professionals accustomed to California's quake risks, Mr. Leventhal anticipates little long-term change in the city's commercial real estate market. 

Still, local builders are eager to tell the world that most of San Francisco doesn't look like the TV images of destruction.
Planners of the Urban Land Institute real estate conference this week hastily added a panel on the quake's effects. "The message is we build'em right," says Peter Bedford, a California developer and officer at Urban Land Institute. "There's seven million square feet of space that's doing great." 

The Sept. 25 "Tracking Travel" column advises readers to "Charge With Caution When Traveling Abroad" because credit-card companies charge 1% to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars.
In fact, this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad. 

In contrast to the 1% conversion fee charged by Visa, foreign-currency dealers routinely charge 7% or more to convert U.S. dollars into foreign currency.
On top of this, the traveler who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion.
At the end of the trip, any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars, with another commission due. 

The card holder will pay the modest 1% fee only on the amounts actually needed.
Typically, he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure, and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill.
In the meantime, the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1% during that "float" period alone.

San Francisco 

MGM Grand Inc. has agreed to pay $93 million and nearly 1.8 million common shares to buy 117 acres of land along the Las Vegas, Nev., Strip as a site for its planned movie-studio and theme-park resort. 

Of the total purchase price, $50 million cash and $30 million in stock (nearly 1.8 million shares) would be paid to buy the existing 700-room Marina Hotel & Casino from Southwest Securities, a Nevada limited partnership.
The remaining properties to be acquired are the Tropicana Country Club & Golf Course, a facility jointly owned by Ramada Inc., of Phoenix, Ariz., and the Jaffe family, and a small parcel owned by MGM Grand director James D. Aljian. 

The purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with MGM Grand's planned offering of six million common shares.
The luxury airline and casino company, 98.6%-owned by investor Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp., earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties, but didn't disclose the purchase price. 

The proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly 1.8 million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring MGM Grand's total shares outstanding to 28.7 million, of which 72% will be owned by Mr. Kerkorian and Tracinda, according to the prospectus. 

In over-the-counter trading, MGM Grand was bid at $17.50 a share. 

Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company's Desert Inn resort in Las Vegas, refurbishing certain aircraft of the MGM Grand Air unit, and to acquire the property for the new resort.
The company said it estimates the Desert Inn remodeling will cost about $32 million, and the refurbishment of the three DC-8-62 aircraft, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp., will cost around $24.5 million. 

MGM Grand said the latest stock offering won't cover the $600 million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park, and added it will need to seek additional financing, either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings, at a later date.
Construction is set to begin in early 1991. 

The resort will include the MGM Grand Hotel, a multi-spired, castle-like facility that will include 5,000 rooms and 85,000 square feet of casino space.
The facility will be marketed toward families, and room rates will be between $35 and $55 a night, MGM Grand said. 

The prospectus didn't include many details about the studio and theme park, although conceptual drawings, released this month, show that it may feature several "themed" areas similar to those found at parks built by Walt Disney Co. 

Two old friends, George Bush and Deng Xiaoping, are trying to limit further damage to U.S.-China ties.
But as Congress prepares a fresh package of sanctions against Beijing, the already-tense relationship could get worse. 

The problem for Congress will be to weigh what China is saying to its people against the more conciliatory message it is delivering to the Bush administration. 

In a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation, Mr. Deng sent an indirect signal to Washington via T.D. Lee, a Columbia University physicist who met Mr. Deng and other Chinese leaders in Beijing last month.
When he met with Mr. Bush on his return, Mr. Lee says, he told the president that the Chinese "made statements to me that I regard as a first step toward reconciliation." 

The communication Mr. Lee brought represents the softer line the U.S. has been hoping to hear from Chinese officials since the June 4 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. 

The Chinese leader, Mr. Lee informed Mr. Bush, expressed some regret for what had happened in Beijing and conceded that China's officials bore some responsibility.
Mr. Lee says Mr. Deng told him: "We should not mind those who participated in demonstrations, signed anti-government materials and went on hunger strikes." Mr. Deng added, says Mr. Lee, that "we really made mistakes.
We must not shirk our responsibility and we cannot just blame the demonstrators." 

Mr. Lee also reported to the president that, in a separate meeting, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin said the Chinese leadership "looked kindly on the students who took part in the demonstrations." Mr. Jiang also pledged that the Chinese Red Cross would publish "very soon" a list of those killed.
And he told the physicist that China's leaders were "very much concerned" about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims' families. 

"I transmitted my conversations to the White House," Prof.
Lee says.
But, he adds, "I was not acting as a messenger." He says that the Chinese never asked him to convey their statements to President Bush, but that the White House spontaneously invited him to do so.
Mr. Lee concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in China, but attributes that to the fact that the situation in China is "very complex." 

According to U.S. sources in Beijing, the administration hopes Mr. Deng's fairly conciliatory comments will prod Congress to be cautious about further sanctions against Beijing. "The president doesn't want to have legislative sanctions," says a U.S. official. "But he may not have a choice." 

Given China's far-from-conciliatory statements to its own people, Mr. Bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions.
Beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations.
Sentences have been stiff.
A university student got eight years for participating in the rallies, sources in Beijing said, while an 18-year-old worker got 10 years. 

Nor has Beijing hinted to its citizens that it will publish the identities of those killed.
So far, the victims are officially considered evil-doers, and their families receive no compensation.
A man gunned down by a stray bullet while cycling to work carries, after his death, the official stigma of "counterrevolutionary," his wife says. 

What's more, much of China's official rhetoric is hostile to the U.S. China frequently lambastes the U.S. Embassy for harboring astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, a political dissident who took refuge there after the massacre. "In the U.S., there are still people who want to crush China and interfere in our internal affairs," Zhu Qizhen, China's new ambassador to the U.S., said as he left for Washington last week. 

The House and Senate are to begin soon hashing out an agreement for sanctions legislation.
It will probably be attached to a State Department authorization bill, which Mr. Bush isn't expected to veto.
A congressional staffer involved in drafting the sanctions says they are likely to mirror those Mr. Bush enacted shortly after the massacre.
But as legislative action, they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult to rescind. 

Measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges, a suspension of most high-level government contacts and a halt to U.S. trade enhancement programs, such as the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Trade Development Program. 

Codifying those sanctions could prompt Chinese retaliation. "If the two sides aren't careful, U.S.-China ties could spin downward, out of control," says a U.S. official in Beijing. "Bush and Deng are hoping {that} cooler heads prevail." 

General Motors Corp. 's big defense and automotive electronics unit, GM Hughes Electronics, said net income fell 22% in the third quarter, reflecting declining military spending and slumping GM vehicle production. 

Meanwhile, net at GM's finance arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp., fell 3.1%.
By contrast, Electronic Data Systems Corp., GM's data processing subsidiary, boosted net 16%. 

GM closed down $1.875 at $44.875 in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
Earnings for GM common stock, reflecting the performance of GM's core automotive operations, will be disclosed this morning.
GM Class H, which represents a dividend interest in Hughes earnings, closed at $29, up 25 cents in Big Board composite trading.
GM Class E, which represents a dividend interest in EDS profit, fell 75 cents to $52.25 on the Big Board. 

The earnings drop at GM Hughes Electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and GM's North American automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the Delco Electronics Corp. side of the GM Hughes unit. 

Profit at the unit fell to $110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $24 million one-time charge associated with Hughes's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end.
Even excluding the charge, however, net fell 5%. 

In addition, GM's North American vehicle production fell 8.4% from a year ago, which hurt Delco Electronic's earnings, a company spokesman said.
That decline was reflected in revenue for the GM Hughes unit, which edged down to $2.58 billion from $2.63 billion. 

In the nine months, GM Hughes net fell 6.6% to $486.6 million, or $1.48 a share, from $521 million, or $1.58 a share.
Revenue rose 3.5% to $8.47 billion from $8.18 billion. 

At GMAC, net dropped 3.1% to $234.5 million from $241.9 million.
The finance unit attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier.
GMAC said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35% in the U.S., largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales.
GMAC profits are combined with earnings from the rest of GM's operations and attributed to the company's traditional common stock. 

In the first nine months, GMAC's earnings fell 8% to $859.5 million from $930.2 million. 

At EDS, third-quarter profit jumped 16% to a record $110.9 million, or 93 cents a share, from $95.9 million, or 79 cents a share.
Revenue rose 12% to $1.37 billion from $1.22 billion. 

In the nine months, EDS earned $315.8 million, or $2.62 a share, up 13% from $280.7 million, or $2.30 a share.
Revenue rose 14% to $4.03 billion from $3.54 billion.
Revenue from non-GM accounts was 45% of EDS's total business in the latest nine months, compared with 40% a year earlier.
The company has said it wants to boost non-GM revenue to at least 50% of its total business by the end of 1990. 

Westinghouse Electric Corp., capitalizing on a major restructuring program, expects operating margins of more than 10% and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year, top officers told securities analysts here. 

John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5% annually through the next three years. 

In 1988, the company earned $822.8 million, or $5.66 a share, on sales of $12.49 billion. 

Since 1983, Westinghouse has shed 70 businesses that it didn't expect to produce 10% operating margins while acquiring 55 businesses. 

In the past 20 months alone, Paul E. Lego, president and chief operating officer, said the divestiture of $300 million of slow-growth, low-profit businesses has been more than offset by $600 million in profitable acquisitions. 

Westinghouse expects to meet its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy.
Even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of 2% to 2.5%, "we can handle that," Mr. Marous said.
GNP is the total value of the nation's output of goods and services. 

A bright spot is the company's power-generation business, which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years.
Mr. Marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company's target goal of 8.5%. 

While Westinghouse hasn't had a nuclear power plant order from a U.S. utility in about a decade, excess capacity is beginning to shrink.
Mr. Lego said the company foresees the need for a major boost in new-generation capability throughout the 1990s. 

Westinghouse also is well positioned to sell steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers.
The company's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mr. Lego said. 

He said the independent power segment could grow to provide as much as 50% of near-term generation capacity, adding: "We expect to supply a significant share of this market." 

Westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to 25% of total corporate sales from 20% last year.
The company is negotiating with the Soviets to build a Thermo King truck-refrigeration plant that would produce about 10,000 units annually. 

Mr. Marous said Westinghouse would own 70% of the facility.
The deal, which will involve an initial $20 million investment, was struck with a handshake, he added. 

Company officials also said that any gain from the sale of Westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of Asea Brown Boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
The executives didn't disclose the size of the expected gain. 

Capital expenditure in 1990 will rise slightly, Mr. Marous said, from an estimated $470 million this year. 

Investors poured $2.8 billion more into money-market mutual funds in the latest week despite further declines in yields. 

Assets of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report jumped to $351.2 billion in the week ended Tuesday, the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter said.
Assets soared $4.5 billion in the previous week. 

Meanwhile, the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a tenth of a percentage point, the largest drop since midsummer.
The average seven-day compound yield, which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for a year, fell to 8.47%, its lowest since late last year, from 8.55% the week before, according to Donoghue's. 

"Lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates," said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report.
Money funds invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit, all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring. 

Individual investors can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short-term instruments.
The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for example, was just 7.77%.
The average yield on six-month CDs of $50,000 or less at major banks was 7.96% in the week ended Tuesday, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service. 

One way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments, so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period.
The average maturity of the taxable funds that Donoghue's follows increased by two days in the latest week to 40 days, its longest since August. 

"They're anticipating further declines in rates and they're going to get them, slowly," said Walter Frank, chief economist for the Donoghue Organization, publisher of Money Fund Report. 

Average maturity was as short as 29 days at the start of this year, when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward.
The average seven-day compound yield of the funds reached 9.62% in late April. 

The highest-yielding funds are still above 9%.
The top-performing fund in the latest week was Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, with a seven-day compound yield of 9.45%.
The fund invests heavily in dollar-denominated money-market securities overseas.
It is currently waiving management fees, which contributes to the higher yield. 

The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds fell to 8.14% from 8.21%, Donoghue's reported.
The average 30-day simple yield slid to 8.22% from 8.26%, and the average 30-day compound yield fell to 8.56% from 8.60%. 

David Evans, who last week resigned as president and chief executive of Qintex Entertainment Inc. "for personal reasons" just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection, has been temporarily reappointed to both positions, the company said. 

Qintex Entertainment also said Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd, 37 years old, would join the nine-member board.
He succeeds Roger Kimmel, who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company's role in buying MGM/UA Communications Co. was no longer necessary. 

Mr. Evans will stay until a successor is found, but not later than the end of the year, the company said. 

It was the 49-year-old Mr. Evans who had moved into the offices of MGM/UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company.
After MGM/UA terminated the $1.5 billion merger because of a dispute over a $50 million letter of credit, Qintex Entertainment -- which is 43%-owned by Qintex Australia -- found itself facing problems of its own.
And the relationship between Qintex Entertainment and the Australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating. 

On Oct. 19, Qintex Entertainment was about to default on a $5.9 million payment owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program.
Qintex Entertainment was depending on Qintex Australia to arrange financing.
But early on Oct. 19, the second of two hectic days of board meetings, Mr. Evans said he believed Qintex Australia wouldn't be forthcoming.
He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before the MCA deadline, according to a source familiar with the sessions. 

But a majority of the board, which includes three members from the Australian company, overrode him.
Mr. Evans resigned.
Later in the day, according to the source, the board reversed itself, decided to file for bankruptcy protection, and asked Mr. Evans to stay on.
Mr. Evans told the board he needed the weekend to think about it.
Mr. Evans couldn't be reached yesterday for comment. 

Last Monday, Qintex Australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets.
Last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to Qintex Entertainment. 

Separately, a Qintex Entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in Los Angeles charging Qintex Australia with misleading shareholders about Qintex Entertainment's financial position.
Qintex Australia said it hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment. 

Ronald J. Taylor, 48, was named chairman of this insurance firm's reinsurance brokerage group and its major unit, G.L. Hodson & Son Inc. Robert G. Hodson, 65, retired as chairman but will remain a consultant.
Stephen A. Crane, 44, senior vice president and chief financial and planning officer of the parent, was named president and chief executive of the brokerage group and the unit, succeeding Mr. Taylor.
The appointments are effective Nov. 1.
Corroon said it will announce a successor to Mr. Crane at a later date. 

The Canadian government plans to auction on Tuesday 750 million Canadian dollars (US$639.9 million) of 9.25% bonds due Dec. 1, 1999, the Finance Department said. 

Proceeds of the issue will be used for general government purposes. 

Finnish conglomerate Nokia Oy AB said it reached an agreement to buy Dutch cable company NKF Kabel B.V. for 420 million Finnish markka ($99.5 million). 

Nokia said it will gain control over NKF Kabel by buying 51% of the shares in NKF Holding N.V., which owns NKF Kabel. 

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it awarded General Dynamics Corp. a $64 million contract to launch the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite in June 1990. 

CRRES is a joint NASA-Air Force satellite to study the effects of space radiation on micro-electronic components. 

NASA said General Dynamics will launch CRRES using an Atlas 1 rocket. 

Ogilvy & Mather, whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by WPP Group earlier this year, will see its profit margins bounce back to the "11.5% range" in 1990, said Graham Phillips, the agency's new chairman-elect. 

The ad agency's pretax profit margins were slightly under 10% at the time of the takeover, according to analysts; London-based WPP's goal is to increase margins to 12%. 

Mr. Phillips made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency.
British-born, the 24-year Ogilvy veteran was named last week to succeed Kenneth Roman, who is leaving by year's end to take a top post at American Express, an Ogilvy client.
Surrounded by stacks of paper, two computers and photos of himself boating and flying, Mr. Phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency. 

First and foremost, Mr. Phillips said he hopes to improve client service.
Ogilvy under the fastidious Mr. Roman gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients, of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed, must -- follow.
And some of its top client-service executives, including Mr. Phillips, were promoted to the point they were saddled with administrative duties, with little time to see clients. 

But Mr. Phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy.
He also plans to get to know clients that Mr. Roman was closer to, such as Lever Brothers, American Express and Seagram.
The two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins. "Clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month, but two or three times a week," he said. 

Mr. Phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the WPP takeover.
The reorganization is supposed to make one-stop shopping -- buying advertising, public relations and design all in one place, or "Ogilvy Orchestration" in Ogilvyspeak -- a reality. 

Under the reorganization, Ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a "client service director" to work as the client's single contact for all those services. "There is little or no integration of our work, quality is spotty, there is no single focus," Mr. Phillips complained to staffers in March, when the reorganization was announced.
Now Mr. Phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including American Express, American Telephone & Telegraph and Ryder -- by year's end. 

Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task.
He isn't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman.
Under his watch, office politicking was often rampant in the agency's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year.
And while last week the agency hired a top Chiat/Day/Mojo executive, Bill Hamilton, to try to bolster its work, "Graham has to get the revenue of that New York office moving," says James Dougherty, an analyst with County NatWest Securities. 

The one thing Mr. Phillips clearly does have going for him is continuity, although it isn't certain if that will be enough.
As Mr. Dougherty says, "The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top . . . and Graham is obviously a long-term member of the Ogilvy Mafia, as we call it." 

Mr. Phillips and Mr. Roman are indeed quite similar in substance, if not in style.
While Mr. Roman is a workaholic detailsman, Mr. Phillips would rather delegate, leaving him time for his interests outside the office.
Mr. Roman, by contrast, seems rarely to cut loose at all, although he did appear at Ogilvy's Halloween party Friday decked out in duck feet and a duck hat, costumed as a "lame duck." 

Mr. Phillips said the company's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable, given that the company's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious, oversized new New York headquarters.
The move, budgeted at about $7 million, actually came in at about $10 million, he said. 

But margins will be helped, too, by some other cost-saving steps.
Ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff, closed the executive dining room and, after the takeover, let go half a dozen financial executives.
WPP, which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way, instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in Ogilvy's new headquarters building to outsiders.
The fact that the agency will now be part of a U.K. company, under British accounting rules, will also make the profit picture look better. 

Y&R's Klein Steps Down 

Arthur Klein, president of Young & Rubicam's New York office, stepped down "temporarily" in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in New Haven, Conn., that he, the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981. 

In an internal memo, Alex Kroll, the agency's chairman, said Mr. Klein decided to remove himself to minimize "negative reaction" from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense. "The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R," Mr. Kroll wrote.
He said Mr. Klein will return to his post at the end of the trial "at which he will be vindicated." 

Mr. Klein will work with Mr. Kroll on some of the agency's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending.
Peter Georgescu, president of Y&R's ad operations, will assume Mr. Klein's day-to-day role. 

Wells Rich's New Partner 

Wells, Rich, Greene named Cheryl Heller as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group, which concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising. 

Ms. Heller, 38, had headed up Boston agency Heller/Breene, a unit of WCRS.
The agency, with about $35 million in billings, will be dissolved, with some of its staffers absorbed by WCRS's Della Femina McNamee unit in Boston, Ms. Heller said.
She said it was too early to say what would happen to its clients, including Reebok and Apple. 

At Wells Rich, Ms. Heller will concentrate on accounts that include Philip Morris's Benson & Hedges cigarette brand, which relies on print ads, Ms. Heller's specialty.
As previously reported, the account is troubled, with Philip Morris asking Backer Spielvogel Bates, Ogilvy & Mather, and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work.
Wells Rich declined to comment on the status of the account, as did the other agencies. 

Air & Water Technologies Corp. completed the acquisition of Falcon Associates Inc., a Bristol, Pa., asbestos-abatement concern, for $25 million of stock. 

Air & Water, which provides environmental services and systems, paid about 1.4 million of its shares for Falcon.
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Air & Water closed unchanged at $17.50. 

At July 31, Air & Water had nearly 10 million shares outstanding. 

Two rival bidders for Connaught BioSciences extended their offers to acquire the Toronto-based vaccine manufacturer Friday. 

Institut Merieux S.A., which offered 942 million Canadian dollars (US$801.2 million), or C$37 a share for Connaught, said it would extend its bid, due to expire last Thursday, to Nov. 6. 

A C$30-a-share bid by Ciba-Geigy Ltd., a pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland, and California-based Chiron Corp., a bioresearch concern, was extended to Nov. 16.
It had been due to expire Friday evening. 

Merieux previously said it would ensure its bid remained open pending a final decision by Canadian regulators on whether to approve the takeover.
Merieux, a vaccine and bioresearch firm based in Lyon, France, is controlled 50.1% by state-owned Rhone Poulenc S.A. 

The Canadian government previously said Merieux's bid didn't offer enough "net benefit" to Canada to be approved, and gave Merieux an until mid-November to submit additional information. 

Merieux officials said last week that they are "highly confident" the offer will be approved once it submits details of its proposed investments to federal regulators. 

Both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of Connaught's shares outstanding. 

Institut Merieux, which already holds a 12.5% stake in Connaught, said that at the close of business Thursday, 5,745,188 shares of Connaught and C$44.3 million face amount of debentures, convertible into 1,826,596 common shares, had been tendered to its offer.
At the close of business Thursday, Ciba-Geigy and Chiron said 11,580 common shares had been tendered to their offer.
At last report, Connaught had 21.8 million shares outstanding. 

Separately, the Ontario Supreme Court said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the University of Toronto against Connaught in connection with the Merieux bid. 

In a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and Connaught, the parties said they agreed that as a result of reaching a C415 million research accord, "It is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits {of the case} at this time." 

Lawyers for the two sides weren't immediately available for comment. 

The university had sought an injunction blocking Connaught's board from recommending or supporting an offer for the company by Merieux. 

The West German machinery and plant equipment industry's orders rose an inflation-adjusted 1% in September from a year earlier despite a sharp drop in foreign orders, the German Association of Machinery Makers said. 

Before adjustment for inflation, the association said, orders were up a nominal 5%.
While domestic orders climbed an adjusted 8% and a nominal 11% in September, foreign orders declined 4% after inflation and 1% on a nominal basis. 

In the third quarter, orders rose a real 5% and a nominal 9%.
Domestic orders were up a real 11% and a nominal 14%, while foreign orders rose a real 1% and a nominal 5%. 

Japanese companies have long been accused of sacrificing profit to boost sales.
But Fujitsu Ltd. has taken that practice to a new extreme. 

Japan's biggest computer maker last week undercut seven competitors to win a contract to design a mapping system for the city of Hiroshima's waterworks.
Its bid: one yen, or less than a U.S. penny. 

The bid created such a furor that Fujitsu said it is now offering to withdraw from the project. "From a common-sense viewpoint, it was not socially acceptable," a Fujitsu spokeswoman said yesterday.
Hiroshima city officials couldn't be reached to find out whether they would drop Fujitsu's bid. 

Fujitsu said it issued the low bid because it wanted a foot in the door of a potentially lucrative market. 

"We desperately wanted the contract because we want experience in the field," the Fujitsu spokeswoman said. "We expect a big market in the future, so in the long term it will be profitable.
It's a kind of an investment." 

Hiroshima's waterworks bureau said the municipal government had budgeted about 11 million yen ($77,500) for the project. "I was flabbergasted," Tatsuhara Yamane, head of the bureau, was quoted by Kyodo news service as saying. "I understand the firm's enthusiasm in getting the deal, but such a large company would have been better off showing a little more discretion." 

Indeed, Fujitsu officials admitted they may have been a little overzealous.
The Fujitsu spokeswoman said headquarter officials didn't approve the bid in advance and will take measures so this kind of thing doesn't happen in the future. "It's contrary to common sense," she added. 

Specifically, Fujitsu won the right to design the specifications for a computerized system that will show water lines throughout the city.
The system could be used in a fire or earthquake to locate problems, among other things. 

A waterworks official said Fujitsu will have to design the system so it would be compatible with other makers' equipment.
But industry officials expressed concern that the initial project might give Fujitsu an edge in winning more lucrative contracts later. 

Fujitsu said it hopes the Hiroshima contract will help it secure pacts with other municipalities.
Japanese local governments are expected to invest heavily in computer systems over the next few years, and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue. "In the near future, it will be a big market, not just for waterworks, but for all mapping systems," the Fujitsu spokeswoman said. "We can expect a hundreds-of-billions-of-yen market." 

No foreign companies bid on the Hiroshima project, according to the bureau.
But the Japanese practice of deep discounting often is cited by Americans as a classic barrier to entry in Japan's market.
Earlier this year, the U.S. complained that Japan's supercomputer makers were effectively closing out foreign competitors by slashing prices as much as 90% for universities. 

Fujitsu wasn't the only company willing to sacrifice profit on the project.
Three competitors bid between 300,000 yen and 500,000 yen, according to the Hiroshima government office.
Other bids ranged from about 10 million yen to 29 million yen. 

Polly Peck International Inc. 's agreement to acquire 51% of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction. 

Polly Peck, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new shares of Sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions.
Japanese government officials, eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas, hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan.
Polly Peck's chairman, Asil Nadir, echoed the official Japanese view of the accord, which was announced Friday. 

"The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has, I think, been demolished at a stroke," Mr. Nadir said. 

But analysts say Sansui is a special case.
It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen. "If you find sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for sale," said George Watanabe, a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc. 

Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike Sansui, which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held.
But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year, while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies. 

Nor do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases.
If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies weren't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers. 

Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of Sansui's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour.
Sansui was once one of Japan's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles. 

But in recent years, the market has moved toward less expensive "mini-component" sets, miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other. 

Some of Sansui's fellow audio-specialty companies, such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp., responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own, by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or portable cassette players.
Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses. 

As the yen soared in recent years, Sansui's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle.
While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia. "Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with" changes in the marketplace, said Ryosuke Ito, Sansui's president. 

But even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern, some management consultants maintain. 

Yoshihisa Murasawa, a management consultant for Booz-Allen & Hamilton (Japan) Inc., said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future. "Attitudes {toward being acquired} are still negative, but they're becoming more positive," Mr. Murasawa said. "In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make sense." 

Whether Polly Peck's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen, but at the news conference, Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around.
Sansui, he said, is a perfect fit for Polly Peck's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an "original equipment maker" basis for sale under other companies' brand names. 

He said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui's product line, using Sansui's engineers to design the new products, and will move Sansui's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck's own factories. 

"Whatever capital it (Sansui) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected," Mr. Nadir said. 

And while Polly Peck isn't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui, it is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer. 

Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir, who is 25% owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman.
He took Polly Peck, once a small fabric wholesaler, and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980.
In September, it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc. 's Del Monte foods unit for #557 million ($878 million). 

Last month, Polly Peck posted a 38% jump in pretax profit for the first half to #54.8 million from #39.8 million on a 63% rise in sales.

Charles D. Way, president of this restaurant operator, assumed the additional post of chief executive officer.
He succeeds Alvin A. McCall in the position.
Mr. McCall will remain chairman. 

Federal Reserve critics used to complain of "stop and go" monetary policies.
They claimed that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt.
But under Alan Greenspan that has changed.
A supremely cautious man, the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow. 

Indeed, his caution has become legendary within the government.
He fusses endlessly over economic statistics, dissecting them in dozens of ways, probing for hours in search of potential problems.
After thoroughly digesting reams of information, he often concludes that more data are needed, and when he finally decides to act, his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small. 

Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge.
Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets.
But he refused, claiming that he wanted to see what happened Monday morning before making any public statement. 

Mr. Greenspan's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed's ranks.
A "senior Fed official" spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times, saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed.
The statement angered Chairman Greenspan, but it was greeted with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets.
And, while the mutinous Fed member hasn't gone public, some Fed governors, most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, are known to have disagreed with the chairman's decision to remain silent.
Ironically, the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan, who is mistakenly seen as the source.
At a hearing last week, Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that "Chairman Greenspan's" announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a "very important statement." Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he wasn't sure whether Mr. Greenspan "made a statement himself, or whether that was a newspaper report." 

The Fed chairman's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market's plunge, when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets.
A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system.
And, by the end of that week, the key federal funds interest rate, which is largely controlled by the Fed, had settled at 8.75%, barely changed from the level of just under 9% that prevailed the previous week. 

Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault.
Signs of growing weakness in the economy, paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control, have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates. 

Those concerns aren't expressed in public.
In fact, the administration and the Fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds, fearing stories about an administration-Fed split added to the stock market's jitters.
Still, the split is there. 

The administration's concerns are understandable.
The economy is showing signs of weakness, particularly among manufacturers.
Exports, which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years, seem to have stalled.
Factory payrolls and production fell in September, and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch. 

But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy, partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing.
In addition, the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road.
Inflation may be stable at the moment, running at about 4.5%.
But if the Fed eases too soon, Mr. Greenspan fears, prices may begin to accelerate again next year.
Moreover, if the Fed holds tight, it may be able gradually to reduce inflation, moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the Fed chairman embraced in testimony to Congress last week. 

So far, Mr. Greenspan's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well.
His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession. "We've gotten through two stock market crashes, and we've gone through an election without any major problems," says David Hale, an economist of Kemper Financial Services. "I think you have to give Greenspan a good rating." 

But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes.
The Fed's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession, perhaps starting early next year.
If that happens, Chairman Greenspan could well become an open target.
Already, Congress is toying with legislation to curb the Fed's independence.
If the economy turns down, such proposals could gain strong momentum. 

It is a peaceful time in this part of western India.
The summer crop is harvested, winter sowing has yet to begin.
Farmers in loose turbans and fancy earrings spend their afternoons laughing and gossiping at the markets. 

One could imagine such a lull in the lives of the Arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices.
For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s, the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame.
The Arabs had merely oil.
These farmers may have a grip on the world's very heart.
Or, at least, its heart disease. 

That is because Sidhpur has a near-monopoly on the world's supply of flea seed, also known as flea wort or, in Western parlance, psyllium: a tiny, tasteless, obscure seed that, according to early research, may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood.
Ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed, Americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals.
If further research proves the seed's benefits, this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil. 

"This seed's not grown anywhere else in India, or anywhere else in the world," says T.V. Krishnamurthy, a vice president of Procter & Gamble India Ltd., a major psyllium buyer and promoter. "The proper climatic conditions don't exist in many places in the world." Arvind Patel, a processor and exporter of the seed, raves: "If psyllium takes the place of oat bran, it will be huge." 

Whether psyllium makes Sidhpur's fortune depends on cholesterol-fearing Americans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, of course, the outcome of further research.
Only one thing is certain here: Pysllium is likely to remain solely an export item from Sidhpur for a long time.
Local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek, a legume.
But they have no desire to eat a bowl of psyllium each morning, and, perhaps, little need: lean, frugal vegetarians, the farmers are innocents in the clogged, treacherous world of cholesterol. 

Psyllium is an annual herb, Plantago ovata, that has been used for centuries by folk doctors here, mainly as a laxative and anti-diarrheal.
As such, the soluble fiber has an almost fanatic following in northern India. "I can assure you," attests a 25-year-old lawyer in New Delhi, with a meaningfully raised eyebrow, "from personal experience, it works." A prominent businessman in Bombay gives a similar testimonial: "I have been taking it daily since 1961." Folk doctors also prescribe it for kidney, bladder and urethra problems, duodenal ulcers and hemorrhoids.
Some apply it to gouty joints. 

The plant has a hairy stem that produces flowers and diminutive seeds.
It is the seed's colorlessness and size -- 1,000 of them weigh only 1.5 grams, or about as much as two paper clips -- that explain the historical allusions to fleas.
The transluscent husk of the seed is removed, sifted and crushed; the seed itself is fed to animals.
Some 90% of the crop, which was worth $26 million last year, is exported. 

For decades, psyllium husk has been the main ingredient in such laxatives as Procter & Gamble Co. 's Metamucil, the top-selling brand in the U.S., and Ciba-Geigy Corp. 's Fiberall.
But some time ago, researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
Cincinnati-based P&G took an interest; it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol. 

One of the studies, done at the University of Minnesota, tested 75 people with raised cholesterol levels.
After 16 weeks, the group that took three daily teaspoons of Metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels, and an even larger reduction in levels of low-density lipoproteins, the so-called bad cholesterol.
In late 1987, P&G asked the FDA for approval to market Metamucil as the first non-prescription, cholesterol-lowering product in the 

In April, the psyllium bandwagon got more crowded.
General Mills Inc., the food giant, launched a breakfast cereal called Benefit, containing psyllium, oat, wheat and beet bran; the words, "reduce cholesterol" were prominently displayed on its package.
In September, Kellogg Co. launched a competing psyllium-fortified cereal called Heartwise. 

Suddenly, on television, in advertisements and on their cereal boxes, Americans were inundated with news about the obscure seed.
The flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals.
This month, the Food and Drug Administration expressed concern that Americans might someday, in various forms, ingest too much psyllium. 

Currently, there is a lull in the psyllium war.
The FDA has asked Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe.
It also ordered P&G to produce more studies to buttress its claims that Metamucil can lower cholesterol.
But the agency hasn't yanked psyllium off store shelves.
If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium, other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products. 

"It's going to be a sensational thing," says Mr. Krishnamurthy of P&G in Bombay.
Says psyllium exporter Mr. Patel: "I just got back yesterday from the U.S.
In the newspapers, on the radio and TV, psyllium is everywhere." 

But the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers.
They only know of one use for the crop, as a laxative, and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop, they think of the seed as a marginal crop, something to grow between summer wheat crops. 

"Psyllium's not a good crop," complains Sooraji Jath, a 26-year-old farmer from the village of Lakshmipura. "You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined." 

Even at the Basic Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics Export Promotion Council, the government agency that promotes the seed, the psyllium boom is distant thunder.
The staff brags about psyllium's hefty contribution to American regularity, without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol.
The council's annual report has psyllium on its last page, lumped with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and "Nux vomica," a plant that induces vomiting. 

In one way, the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves.
They want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year. 

But there's a catch.
Sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities.
This is partly due to the particular demands of the crop.
Psyllium needs sandy soil, dew during the first few weeks, and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing.
Small crops are grown in Pakistan, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Brazil, but their quality can't compare to that of Indian psyllium. 

Big buyers like Procter & Gamble say there are other spots on the globe, and in India, where the seed could be grown. "It's not a crop that can't be doubled or tripled," says Mr. Krishnamurthy.
But no one has made a serious effort to transplant the crop. 

In Sidhpur, it is almost time to sow this year's crop.
Many farmers, too removed to glean psyllium's new sparkle in the West, have decided to plant mustard, fennel, cumin, fenugreek or castor-oil seeds. 

Mr. Jath is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel. "Maybe I'll plant castor-oil seeds." His brother, Parkhaji, whose head is swathed in a gorgeous crimson turban, nods vigorous assent. 

So when next year's psyllium crop is harvested in March, it may be smaller than the 16,000 metric tons of the past few years -- right at the crest of the psyllium boom. 

And the world could experience its first psyllium shortage. 

Ultimate Corp. signed a letter of intent to market Hewlett-Packard Co. minicomputers, the companies said. 

Ultimate expects the 3 1/2-year agreement to generate $100 million in sales, but it wouldn't estimate profit. 

Under terms of the pact, Ultimate, a computer-systems concern, will market the full line of HP 9000 series 800 multipleuser minicomputers.
Hewlett-Packard is based in Palo Alto, Calif. 

Arthur Price abruptly quit as president and chief executive officer of MTM Entertainment Inc., a Los Angeles production company that has fallen on hard times. 

Mr. Price, 61 years old, also stepped down from the board of TVS Entertainment PLC, the British TV company that last year bought MTM, producer of such TV programs as "Hill Street Blues" and "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." 

A TVS spokesman said he didn't know Mr. Price's plans.
James Gatward, TVS's chief executive, said in a statement that he will "assume overall responsibility" for MTM's operations until a successor is named. 

Industry analysts speculated that Mr. Price's sudden departure may have stemmed from conflicts with Mr. Gatward. 

Mr. Price "wanted to run the MTM business" and may have regretted selling the company to TVS, suggested Charles Denton, managing director of Zenith Productions, a subsidiary of Carlton Communications PLC, London. 

Mr. Gatward declined to comment, and Mr. Price couldn't be reached on Friday.
In the TVS statement, Mr. Price said "leaving MTM was a very difficult decision," but added that "it is now time for a change. . . ." 

The $320 million purchase of MTM represented an audacious international move for TVS, which then was about half the U.S. concern's size.
At the time, Mr. Gatward said his friendship with Mr. Price had smoothed the way for its link with the small British company.
But TVS stunned industry analysts last month by disclosing that it expected MTM to post an operating loss for this year. 

In that announcement, TVS also said it was trimming production finance and hiring a new U.S. sales manager.
Mr. Gatward has spent a lot of time since late September at MTM's headquarters; he eliminated three departments and fired six executives, according to the TVS spokesman.
Further staff cuts are likely, the spokesman indicated. "Obviously, we are looking at making economies across the board." 

TVS blames difficulties in peddling reruns of MTM shows to U.S. broadcasters for the problems at MTM.
The market for reruns sold to local U.S. broadcasters has been weak for the past three or four seasons. 

Mr. Price co-founded MTM in 1969 with U.S. actress Mary Tyler Moore and Grant Tinker, her then-husband.
Mr. Tinker later left to become chairman of National Broadcasting Co.
The TVS spokesman said Mr. Price still holds about an 8% TVS stake, acquired as part of the MTM acquisition.
In late trading on London's Stock Exchange Friday, TVS shares rose four pence to 195 pence a share. 

Dow Jones & Co. extended its tender offer of $18 a share, or about $576 million, for the 33% of Telerate Inc. that it doesn't already own until 5 p.m. EST, Nov. 6. 

The offer, which Telerate's two independent directors have rejected as inadequate, previously had been scheduled to expire at midnight Friday.
Dow Jones said it extended the offer to allow shareholders time to review a supplement to the Dow Jones tender offer circular that it mailed last Friday. 

The supplement contains various information that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since Dow Jones launched the offer on Sept. 26, but it doesn't change the terms and conditions of the offer except to extend its expiration date. 

In Delaware Chancery Court litigation, Telerate has criticized Dow Jones for not disclosing that Telerate's management expects the company's revenue to increase by 20% annually, while Dow Jones based its projections of Telerate's performance on a 12% revenue growth forecast.
In the tender offer supplement, Dow Jones discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20% growth rate "as a hoped-for goal" of Telerate's management "and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company's likely future performance." 

Telerate shares fell 50 cents on Friday to close at $20 each in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Dow Jones shares also fell 50 cents to close at $36.125 in Big Board composite trading. 

Dow Jones has said it believes the $18-a-share price is fair to Telerate's minority shareholders.
Late last week, representatives of Dow Jones and Telerate began negotiations about the terms of the offer, but those talks didn't result in any changes in the offer. 

Telerate provides information about financial markets through an electronic network.
Dow Jones, which owns 67% of Telerate, publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases. 

Douglas H. Miller, self-employed in the oil and gas securities business, was named chairman of this oil and gas exploration company, filling a vacancy.
Mr. Miller, who has been a Coda director, also was named chief executive officer, succeeding Ted Eubank, who remains president and chief operating officer. 

Doskocil Cos. said its bank-debt payments have been extended until May 31, 1990, to give it more time to sell its Wilson Foods Corp. retail and fresh meat operations. 

The company was to repay $58 million in debt on Dec. 31 and $15 million on March 31.
The company acquired the debt when it paid $155 million to purchase Wilson last year. 

An agreement to sell the Wilson assets for $150 million in cash and notes collapsed in late September, when the buyer, a company controlled by George Gillett, couldn't secure financing. 

Ratners Group PLC's U.S. subsidiary has agreed to acquire jewelry retailer Weisfield's Inc. for $50 a share, or about $55 million. 

Weisfield's shares soared on the announcement yesterday, closing up $11 to close at $50 in national over-the-counter trading. 

Ratners and Weisfield's said they reached an agreement in principle for the acquisition of Weisfield's by Sterling Inc.
The companies said the acquisition is subject to a definitive agreement.
They said they expect the transaction to be completed by Dec. 15. 

Weisfield's, based in Seattle, Wash., currently operates 87 specialty jewelry stores in nine states.
In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the company reported sales of $59.5 million and pretax profit of $2.9 million. 

Ratners, which controls 25% of the British jewelry market, would increase the number of its U.S. stores to about 450 stores from 360.
It has said it hopes to control 5% of jewelry business in the U.S. by 1992; currently it controls about 2%. 

Unisys Corp. 's announcement Friday of a $648.2 million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year. 

At the same time, the sheer size of the loss, coupled with a slowing of orders, made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense-electronics concern. 

"Unisys is getting clobbered.
Just clobbered," said Ulric Weil, an analyst at Weil & Associates who had once been high on the company. "The quarter was terrible, and the future looks anything but encouraging." 

Unisys, whose revenue inched up 3.7% in the quarter to $2.35 billion from $2.27 billion in the year-earlier quarter, had an operating loss of about $30 million.
On top of that, the Blue Bell, Pa., concern took a $230 million charge related to the layoffs of 8,000 employees.
That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said a month ago would be laid off.
Unisys said that should help it save $500 million a year in costs, again at the high end of the previously reported range of $400 million to $500 million. 

The company also took a write-off of $150 million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts, as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that slow-growing business.
In addition, Unisys set up an unspecified reserve -- apparently $60 million to $70 million -- to cover the minimum amount it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the defense-procurement scandal.
Unisys also noted that it paid $78.8 million in taxes during the quarter, even though tax payments normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss. 

The tax payments will leave Unisys with $225 million in loss carry-forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters.
In addition, Unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $100 million during the quarter, leaving it within $100 million of its goal of a reduction of $500 million by the end of the year. 

Still, Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter, a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters. 

The company also reported slower growth in another important business: systems that use the Unix operating system.
That would be a huge problem if it were to continue, because Unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone's machines. 

In addition, Unisys must deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load.
Debt has risen to around $4 billion, or about 50% of total capitalization.
That means Unisys must pay about $100 million in interest every quarter, on top of $27 million in dividends on preferred stock. 

Jim Unruh, Unisys's president, said he is approaching next year with caution.
He said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect, and doesn't see much revenue growth in the cards. 

He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year.
He said the move toward standard operating systems means customers aren't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down.
That, he said, is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business: It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to. 

"We've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through," Mr. Unruh said. "The information-systems industry is still going to be a high-growth business, and we're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company.
But we don't minimize the challenges of the near term." 

Securities analysts were even more cautious, having been burned repeatedly on Unisys this year.
Some had predicted earnings of more than $4 a share for this year, up from last year's fully diluted $3.27 a share on earnings of $680.6 million.
But the company said Friday that it had losses of $673.3 million through the first nine months, compared with earnings a year earlier of $382.2 million, or $2.22 a share fully diluted, as revenue inched up 1.4% to $7.13 billion from $7.03 billion.
And Unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter. 

So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $2 a share from $3. "I was feeling like I was too high to begin with," he said. 

Mr. Weil of Weil & Associates said he will remain at $1 a share for next year but said he wonders whether even that low target is at risk. "The break-even point for next year is much lower, but is it low enough?" he asked. 

Reflecting the concern, Unisys stock fell a further 75 cents to $16.25 in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Kellwood Co. said it completed a previously announced acquisition of Crowntuft Manufacturing Corp., a New York-based maker of chenille robes and lounge wear. 

The apparel maker wouldn't disclose terms of the agreement.
Kellwood said Gabriel Hakim Sr., president of Crowntuft, will continue to head Crowntuft's management group. 

Centerior Energy Corp. said the Ohio Water Development Authority approved terms for two series of tax-exempt bonds to finance a water-pollution control and solid-waste disposal facilities. 

The authority will issue a total of $446.5 million of pollution-control revenue bonds.
Proceeds of the sale will go to Centerior's operating subsidiaries to finance the projects, located at a nuclear unit located near Cleveland. 

The bonds will be issued for a term of 34 years at an interest rate of 8%.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. is the underwriter. 

Upset over the use of what it says are its exclusive trademarks, Hells Angels Motorcycle Corp. is fighting back -- in court.
Concord New Horizons Corp., creators of a 1988 movie called Nam Angels, used the gang's name and trademarks without authorization, the not-for-profit corporation says in a complaint filed in federal court. 

Nam Angels depicts a group of the cycle gang's members on a mercenary mission to Viet Nam during the war years. 

In addition to being broadcast on cable television, the movie also is being distributed on videocassettes, the suit alleges in seeking unspecified damages.
Also named in the suit is Media Home Entertainment Inc. of Culver City, Calif., its parent, Heron Communications Inc., and Broadstar Television of Los Angeles, holders of the copyright on the movie. 

A Concord spokeswoman called the suit "unfounded" but declined to comment further. 

Besides being upset with the film's use of the Hells Angels name and logos, the Angels are angry with their depiction in the movie. 

"There is absolutely no way our board or membership would have approved the portrayal of the Hells Angels in this movie," said George Christie, president of the club's Ventura chapter. "Portrayal of our members as disloyal to each other is totally contrary to the most important values of our organization -- loyalty and trust." 

Nam Angels shows Angels fighting with each other and also depicts them as showing no remorse when a member is killed.
Both of these actions aren't characteristic of real Hells Angels, Mr. Christie said. 

Hells Angels was formed in 1948 and incorporated in 1966.
In addition to 26 chapters in the U.S., there are 40 chapters in foreign countries.

Well, the arrogant East Coast media have spoken again ("Going for the Green," editorial, Oct. 17).
Having resided in the great state of California for the past seven years, I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air; when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing. 

Perhaps it's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists, suggesting that their save-the-earth initiatives are "whacky" and referring to so many citizens as "la-la activists." Strange that we don't hear similar criticisms of the East Coast activists who seek to clean up Boston Harbor or rid their beaches of medical waste. 

While there are no easy low-cost solutions, simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state, the nation and the world.
If nothing else, such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action. 

Before your next California-bashing editorial, please spend more time out here witnessing the situation -- it just may change your view. 

John Barry 

Ventura, Calif. 

I realize you were just looking for something snotty to say about California and its environmental movement, but picking Frank Lloyd Wright to say it for you was a bad call.
Wright's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among "la-la activists." Indeed, Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature.
Obviously, it's lost on you that about 75% of the American people these days (and in fact the president of the United States) consider themselves environmentalists. 

As for California being a state run by liberal environmental loonies, let's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from.
Perhaps Mr. Reagan, who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees, is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth.
But it was Frank Lloyd Wright who said, "Is this not Anti-Christ?
The Moloch that knows no God but more?" 

Robert Borden 

Santa Monica, Calif. 

Your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers' comments in letters to the editor, "Alar: Scaring on the Side of Caution." The illogic and inaccuracy of John H. Adams's comments for the National Resources Defense Council fully justifies your characterization of California's Greens in particular as "la-la activists." We may all hope that California's voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university's renowned Prof.
Tom Jukes provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their "wealthy Hollywood weepers." 

I have a different approach to offer, not only to Californians, but to all Americans.
In a free country, the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent with good manners and public safety.
Would-be naysayers should have the burden of proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law.

Warsaw, Va. 

The 170 airlines in the International Air Transport Association last year posted group net profit of $2.5 billion on revenue of $125.1 billion. 

According to the association's annual report, scheduled to be released today in Warsaw, IATA members haven't posted such a strong performance since the late 1970s.
Revenue last year increased by more than 11% over 1988, and net income nearly tripled from restated year-earlier net of $900 million. 

The group attributed the strong results to the favorable economic climate, rising demand for air travel and improved average yield (revenue received per ton of traffic transported a kilometer).
Systemwide, IATA airlines carried 632 million passengers last year, 2% more than in 1987.
But passenger-kilometers, the distance flown while carrying people, increased 5.3% in 1988. 

The association said that lack of airport and air space capacity is the biggest problem facing the airline industry. 

The KGB has abolished a unit known for persecuting dissidents, the government newspaper Izvestia said.
The newspaper quoted KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov as saying the definition of anti-Soviet crimes had narrowed, the laws had changed and people no longer have to fear a simple slip of the tongue.
Mr. Kryuchkov was quoted as saying that in place of the infamous 5th Directorate a new unit would work "to foil the conspiracies of foreign intelligence services to create and use organized anti-government groups in our country." 

Czechoslovakia has restricted consumer-goods exports to neighbor countries because of "massive buying out of food" by tourists from Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union, the Rude Pravo daily said.
Rising inflation in Poland and Hungary makes Czechoslovak food, clothing and shoes relatively cheap for visitors from these countries.
The paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail but said the measures were necessary to protect the domestic market. 

West Germany's biggest union, IG Metall, said it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter hours with strikes against the nation's automotive, steel and engineering industries.
Its chairman told the union to prepare for the worst in next year's confrontation with employers over a new three-year wage deal.
A major goal is to cut the working week to 35 hours from the present 37. 

Last week came news of alarm in Venice over a plan to tap gas fields off the city's coast.
Now comes word from a scientist that over the next century Venice will sink nearly three times faster than the present rate because of the "greenhouse effect." "Global warming means higher tides which will lower Venice by another 23 inches in the next 100 years," Giovanni Cecconi of the the New Venice Consortium said.
The consortium of scientists and companies was set up by Italy to help preserve the fabled city of canals.
Venice has sunk 10 inches in this century. 

West Germany's Quelle said it will establish a mail-order operation with two local partners in the Soviet Union next year.
Saying this is a first for a Western company, West Germany's largest mail-order group said the newly established Moscow-based Intermoda company is scheduled to begin operations in February 1990.
Intermoda will initially only send the textile and clothing section of the Quelle catalog, translated into Russian, to Soviet customers who have access to convertible currency. 

The European Community Commission has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean small-screen color-television sets. 

Saying that a surge in low-priced imports had damaged EC producers' profits and led to job losses, the commission imposed a duty of 10.2% on TVs made by Daewoo, a duty of 12.3% on Goldstar Co., 13% on Samsung and 19.6% on TVs made by other South Korean producers. 

The commission said that EC television producers lost "important market shares" and suffered an "unsustainable" pressure on prices because of the Korean companies' marketing and pricing policies, which it said were "in clear violation" of international trade rules. 

In other news concerning South Korea's television industry, Samsung signed an agreement with Soyuz, the external-trade organization of the Soviet Union, to swap Korean television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from the Soviet Union.
South Korea and the Soviet Union have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices earlier this year. 

Sri Lanka, where more than 15,000 people have died in six years of ethnic turmoil, said it will ban sex and violence from state-owned television next year. "Many programs we have now come from the West and are not suitable to our culture," a government minister said.
A star attraction on the national network is the U.S.'s "Dynasty." . . . A poll of South Koreans showed overwhelming opposition to efforts to curb dog-meat consumption just because it offends foreigners. 

The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the rival suitor for LIN. 

Moreover, the amended pact shows how McCaw's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner, forcing huge debt on the proposed new company.
The debt, estimated at $4.7 billion, could mortgage the cellular company's future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term. 

The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth's and to spin off its broadcasting operations.
But under new terms of the agreement, announced Friday, LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger.
LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend, but commitments from banks still haven't been obtained.
Under previous terms, holders would have received a dividend of only $20 a share. 

In addition, New York-based LIN would exercise its right to buy out for $1.9 billion the 55% equity interest of its partner, Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise.
That money also would have to be borrowed.
In effect, McCaw has forced LIN's hand by bidding $1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month. 

"We're taking on more debt than we would have liked to," acknowledged Michael Plouf, LIN's vice president and treasurer.
Although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt, he estimated that the company wouldn't be profitable until 1994 or later. 

Analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $115 to $125 a share.
They value McCaw's bid at $112 to $118 a share.
The previous BellSouth pact was valued at about $98 to $110 a share. 

McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4% of LIN's stock.
In response to BellSouth's amended pact, the Kirkland, Wash., company extended its own offer to buy 22 million LIN shares for $125 apiece, which would give McCaw a 50.3% controlling interest.
Over the weekend, McCaw continued to call for an auction of LIN. Analysts said they expect McCaw to escalate the bidding again. 

"This game isn't over yet," said Joel D. Gross, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. "At some point, it will become non-economical for one company.
But I don't think we're at that point yet." 

Under its revised proposal, Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50% interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt.
To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company.
The provision, described as "back-end" protection, would require BellSouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay. 

McCaw's bid also has a similar clause.
Only McCaw's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices. 

To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if, after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company isn't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer. 

"We're very pleased with the new deal.
We didn't expect BellSouth to be so responsive," said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., which holds 500,000 LIN shares.
BellSouth's "back-end protection was flawed previously.
We think this is a superior deal to McCaw's.
We're surprised.
We didn't think a sleeping {Bell} mentality would be willing to take on dilution." 

But Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co., finds the BellSouth proposal still flawed because the company doesn't have to wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares. "How many shares will be around in 1995?" he asked. "There's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile." 

BellSouth's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts, especially because of the company's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings.
William O. McCoy, president of the company's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit, said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9% in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter.
Indeed, BellSouth's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable. 

For 1988, BellSouth earned $1.7 billion, or $3.51 a share, on revenue of $13.6 billion.
Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $3.90 a share, or $1.9 billion, but now those estimates are being scaled back. 

In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth shares fell 87.5 cents to $52.125. 

In national over-the-counter trading, LIN shares soared $4.625 to closed at $112.625, while McCaw fell $2.50 a share to $37.75. 

The proposed BellSouth-LIN cellular company, including the newly acquired Metromedia stake, would give the new entity 55 million potential customers, including about 35 million in the nation's top 10 markets. 

Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated that McCaw, in an attempt to buy time, might consider filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the Bell system in 1984. 

Indeed, McCaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement.
Urging LIN directors to conduct "a fair auction on a level playing field," McCaw asked how well the public interest would be served "with the Bell operating companies controlling over 94% of all cellular {potential customers} in the nation's top 10 markets."

Australia's inflation is expected to rise as high as 8.3% in the quarter ending March 30, but could fall to around 7% by June, according to economists. 

The government said the consumer price index rose 2.3% in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from the previous quarter and 8% from a year ago. 

Since its founding in 1818, Brooks Brothers, the standard-bearer of the Ivy League look, has eschewed flashy sales promotions and fashion trends -- the rules that most retailers live by.
But with sales growth sluggish and other men's stores putting on the heat, the venerable retailer can no longer afford such a smug attitude. 

So two weeks ago, thousands of Brooks Brothers charge customers -- customers conditioned to wait for twice-yearly clearance sales -- got a surprise: an invitation to come in and buy any one item for 25% off.
During the four-day promotion, shoppers at the Short Hills, N.J., store lined up to pay for big-ticket items like coats and suits. 

That's not all.
Departing from its newspaper ads featuring prim sketches of a suit or a coat, Brooks Brothers is marketing an updated image in a new campaign that carries the slogan, "The Surprise of Brooks Brothers." One color photo displays a rainbow of dress shirts tied in a knot; another picture shows neckties with bold designs.
The message is loud and clear: This is not your father's Brooks Brothers. 

As part of its national ad pitch, Brooks Brothers will show less preppy women's clothes, moving away from its floppy-tie business stereotype.
One ad shows a bright red jacket paired with a black leather skirt.
And the ad copy is cheeky: "How can you be a Wall Street hot shot without at least one Brooks Brothers suit in your portfolio?" 

Brooks Brothers hopes that shaking its time-honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise. "We have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their {job} interview suit here," says William Roberti, chairman and chief executive officer of Brooks Brothers. "We want them to buy more of their wardrobe here." Industry watchers agree that Brooks Brothers is long overdue in updating its buttoned-down image, which has stunted its growth.
When acquired in May 1988 by British retailer Marks & Spencer PLC, Brooks Brothers' annual operating profit was about $41.8 million on sales of $290.1 million.
Mr. Roberti concedes that since the $750 million takeover, "sales growth hasn't been dramatic." For the 11 months ended March 31, operating profit at the 52-store chain totaled $40.5 million on sales of $286.8 million. 

As Brooks Brothers jumps into the fashion fray, it will be playing catch up.
Many clothiers, especially Ralph Lauren, have cashed in on the recent popularity of updated Ivy League and English styles.
In keeping with men's broader fashion scope today, businessmen are dabbling in English and Italian suits that are conservative but not stodgy.
The rigid Ivy League customer, Brooks Brothers' bread and butter, meanwhile is becoming extinct.
Thus, Brooks Brothers has lost customers to stores that offer more variety such as Paul Stuart, Barneys New York and Louis, Boston. 

"Brooks Brothers no longer has a lock on the {Ivy League} customer who is status-conscious about his clothes," says Charlie Davidson, president of the Andover Shop, a traditional men's store in Cambridge, Mass. 

By making a break from tradition, Brooks Brothers is seeking a delicate balance.
If it promotes fashion too much, the shop risks alienating its old-line customers; by emphasizing "value," it risks watering down its high-minded mystique. 

Fashion industry consultants also question whether the company can make significant strides in its women's business, given that its customer base is less established and that conservative business dress for women is on the decline.
Brooks Brothers' aim is for 20% of total sales to come from the women's department, up from the current 12%. 

"Everybody forgets that there are fashion cycles in classic merchandise," observes Carol Farmer, a retail consultant. "For women, dressing for success in a real structured way is over." 

Despite these challenges, Marks & Spencer sees big potential in Brooks Brothers, noting the widely recognized name and global presence.
Marks & Spencer plans to open roughly 18 more U.S. stores in the next five years.
Brooks Brothers says business is robust at its 30 outlets in Japan and two shops in Hong Kong.
Marks & Spencer is also considering opening stores across Europe sometime in the future. 

Alan Smith, president of Marks & Spencer North America and Far East, says that Brooks Brothers' focus is to boost sales by broadening its merchandise assortment while keeping its "traditional emphasis." The British parent is also streamlining: Brooks Brothers, which continues to make almost all of its merchandise, recently shut one of its two shirt plants in Paterson, N.J., and has closed boys' departments in all but 20 stores. 

Brooks Brothers is also remodeling its stores.
Wednesday, it will unveil a $7 million refurbishing at its flagship store on Madison Avenue.
With newly installed escalators, the store retains its signature wood-and-brass look but is less intimidating.
More shirts and sweaters will be laid out on tables, instead of sitting behind glass cases, so that customers can "walk up and touch them," Mr. Roberti says. 

Because the biggest growth in menswear is in casual sportswear, Brooks Brothers is chasing more of that business.
The entire second floor of its Madison Avenue store is now casual sportswear featuring items such as ski sweaters, leather backpacks and a $42 wool baseball hat with the store's crest. 

The centerpiece of the overhaul, according to Mr. Roberti, is the men's tailored clothing department, where Brooks Brothers has added new suit styles and fabrics. "The perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit," Mr. Roberti says, referring to Brooks Brothers' signature three-button "sack suit," with a center-vented jacket and boxy fit. 

But it now offers more two-button versions and suits with a tapered fit.
It also plans to add suits cut for athletic men with broader upper bodies.
Next spring, nearly 30% of its suits will have pleated pants, compared with virtually none a couple of years ago. 

Says Mr. Roberti: "We want to turn the customer on." 

Waxman Industries Inc. said holders of $6,542,000 face amount of its 6 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures, due March 15, 2007, have elected to convert the debt into about 683,000 common shares. 

The conversion price is $9.58 a share. 

The company said the holders represent 52% of the face amount of the debentures. 

Waxman sells a variety of hardware products for the home repair market. 

A state trial judge in Illinois gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a Bank of New York Co. unit, Irving Trust Co., over the interest rates on Irving's former One Wall Street Account money-market deposit accounts. 

Judge Albert Green, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, also recognized the suit, filed last May by Robert and Cynthia Langendorf, as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers.
The plaintiffs accused Irving of paying less interest than promised in a marketing brochure.
Irving maintained -- and still does -- that its actions were proper under its account agreements with customers. 

Under the proposed settlement, customers with valid claims -- to be submitted by Dec. 15 -- will receive "valuable bank services," such as credit cards with reduced finance charges, for two years.
Larry Drury, attorney for the plaintiffs, valued the settlement at between $6 million and $8 million.
A Bank of New York spokesman in Manhattan, Owen Brady, said, "That's the maximum, outside figure." 

Margaret Thatcher's instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual.
That may be the last thing she needs. 

As the air clears from last week's storm of resignations and reshufflings, the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies.
The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer, the untested John Major, need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again.
Mrs. Thatcher has to come to terms with European economic integration, beginning with the European Monetary System, which Britain is committed to joining fully someday.
Finally, the government has to convince a rattled financial community -- and voters -- it is proceeding coherently toward its goals. 

It sounds like the work of a decade, but the deadline is late 1991, when Mrs. Thatcher is expected to call another national election.
What's worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable.
She could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation, high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit. 

Though Mrs. Thatcher has pulled through other crises, supporters wonder if her steely, autocratic ways are the right formula today. "There's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. Thatcher's style of management has become a political liability," says Bill Martin, senior economist at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew. 

The prime minister's insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers -- including an economic guru who openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson -- confused the financial community.
Last week, the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up: Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters, the adviser, announced his resignation within an hour. 

The confusion could be costly.
Currency traders, suspecting Mr. Major won't defend the pound strenuously, sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark.
Analysts expect further jitters this week. 

A continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate, currently 15%.
That could shove a weak economy into recession.
Economists have been anticipating a slump for months, but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought.
Britain's economy "is developing rapidly toward no-growth," says J. Paul Horne, international economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co. in Paris. 

A mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early 1991, economists say, while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into 1992.
Recovery could be hampered if Britain's major trading partners in Europe, which are enjoying robust economic activity, cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991. 

That would leave Mrs. Thatcher little room for maneuver.
For the Tories to win the next election, voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand.
Though Mrs. Thatcher doesn't need to call an election until June 1992, she would prefer doing so in late 1991. "If the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year's time, she will be very vulnerable," says John Barnes, a lecturer at the London School of Economics. 

There's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the European Community.
It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which links the major EC currencies.
At a June EC summit, Mrs. Thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full EMS membership, saying Britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized capital movements. 

Since then, the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join.
Sir Alan assailed the monetary arrangement as "half-baked" in an article being published in an American economics journal.
That produced little reaction from his boss, reinforcing speculation the government would use its two conditions as a pretext for avoiding full EMS membership. 

Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan, the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue.
Sir Geoffrey Howe, deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS, has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership. 

Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt authorities move interest rates.
Mrs. Thatcher "doesn't like taking orders from foreigners," says Tim Congdon, economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC. 

As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis, many harbor hopes last week's debacle will prompt change. "We won't have any more of this wayward behavior," says Sir Peter Hordern, a backbench Tory member of Parliament. "The party is fed up with sackings of good people." 

It's an unrealistic expectation.
As long as a decade ago, Mrs. Thatcher declared she didn't want debate in her cabinet; she wanted strong government.
Over the weekend, she said she didn't intend to change her style and denied she is authoritarian. "Nonsense," she told an interviewer yesterday on London Weekend Television. "I am staying my own sweet, reasonable self." 

Nashua Corp., rumored a potential takeover target for six months, said that a Dutch company has sought U.S. approval to buy up to 25% of Nashua's shares. 

Nashua immediately responded by strengthening a poison-pill plan and saying it will buy back up to one million of its shares, or 10.4% of the 9.6 million outstanding. 

Nashua, whose major business is selling copiers, facsimile machines and related supplies, said Reiss & Co. B.V. of the Netherlands filed a request with the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for permission to buy more than $15 million of Nashua's stock but less than 25%. 

Previously, an affiliate of Unicorp Canada disclosed a stake of less than 5% in Nashua, according to Daniel M. Junius, Nashua's treasurer. 

Nashua's stock has fluctuated sharply on takeover speculation, rising to a high for the year of $42.875 a share in June from $29.75 in March.
But the company has had weak results so far this year, with earnings declining 43% to $13.7 million, or $1.43 a share, on a 4% decline in revenue to $713.5 million through the first nine months of the year. 

Its stock has slumped recently, closing unchanged Friday at $29 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange; at that price, the company has a market value of about $278.4 million.
Nashua announced the Reiss request after the market closed. 

Mr. Junius said Nashua's "intention is to remain an independent public company." The company said it amended its shareholder rights plan by reducing to 10% from 20% the level of ownership by an outsider that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy additional shares of Nashua common at half price. 

In addition, the company's board authorized the purchase of up to an additional one million shares.
Under a program approved by the company in 1987 that didn't specify a share amount, Nashua had purchased 481,000 shares through Sept. 29. 

Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, said that while Nashua's performance this year has been "atrocious," the company nonetheless is attractive as a "classic breakup candidate because there's no similarity between its {four} businesses." He estimated the breakup value at $55 a share.
In addition to selling Japanese-made photocopiers and facsimile machines in Europe and copier supplies in the U.S., Nashua has three other major businesses: labels and tapes, data storage disks for computers and mail-order photofinishing. 

Home taping of pre-recorded music cuts into record industry revenues, but banning home taping would hurt consumers even more. 

That's the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the Office of Technology Assessment at the request of the House and Senate judiciary committees.
The report is to be released today. 

The report says the availability of such advanced analog recording equipment as cassette recorders doesn't seem to increase the quantity of home copying.
That finding, the report says, casts doubt on the record industry's contention that the new generation of digital recording equipment will inevitably lead to wholesale abuse of copyrighted material by home tapers. 

The longstanding position of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group based in Washington, D.C., is that record companies, performers, songwriters and music publishers need to be remunerated by government-imposed fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping. 

"I think it is a nail in the coffin in any royalty tax proposal," says Gary Shapiro, vice president for government and legal affairs of the Electronic Industries Association in Washington. "What {the report} shows is everything we've been saying for the past eight or nine years -- that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry.
The people who tape the most buy the most." 

Trish Heimers, a spokesperson for RIAA says her organization hasn't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment. 

A recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape, or DAT, recorder sold in the U.S. have a built-in device that restricts its ability to make second copies from DAT tape copies of digital compact disks.
But the disappointing sales of DAT machines here and abroad so far have not seemed to warrant the three years of legal wrangling that went into the agreement. 

Under current copyright laws, it is considered "fair use" to reproduce copyrighted material for one's personal use or for use by one's family or friends, while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited.
A survey contained in the 291-page report, "Copyright and Home Copying: Technology Challenges the Law," found that most people consider home copying for such personal use a "right" -- a right, moreover, that was exercised by 40% of Americans over the age of 10 in the past year. 

The study says that the "ambiguous legal status" of home copying makes it "appropriate to examine the effects on consumers, as well as on industry." Reports by the Office of Technology Assessment don't prescribe any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that Congress may pursue. 

The study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes "an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order to reduce legal and market uncertainties and to prevent de facto changes to copyright law through technology," and says that finding an "appropriate balance of harms and benefits is a political decision, not a technical one." 

TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. said it plans to shift its headquarters to Calgary, Alberta, from Toronto next year to cut costs and be closer to the upstream natural-gas industry. 

Gerald Maier, president and chief executive officer of the natural-gas pipeline and marketing concern, said the company's future growth is "increasingly linked" to decisions made by Calgary-based gas producers. 

"Since deregulation of the market in 1985, producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing," Mr. Maier said. "It's a matter of being close to those suppliers; many of those companies don't know us as well as they should." 

TransCanada transports all gas that moves eastward from Alberta.
That includes all the gas consumed in Ontario and Quebec, along with the bulk of Canadian gas exports to the 

Walter Litvinchuk, vice president of Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd., a Calgary-based gas marketing concern, said the industry will welcome the move. 

"Having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships," Mr. Litvinchuk said. "Since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers' ability to sell it, it helps to have input and access to transportation companies." 

The move, which could cost TransCanada as much as 50 million Canadian dollars (US$42.5 million) in relocation and severance payments, should be complete by next summer, Mr. Maier said.
All 700 Toronto-based employees will be offered positions in Calgary, the company said. 

The company will save between C$4 million and C$6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to Calgary, Mr. Maier added. 

Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the TransCanada pipeline through tolls, which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it. 

TransCanada is 49.1% owned by Montreal-based holding company BCE Inc. 

Last week the British displayed unusual political immaturity.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, resigned because Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters.
The opposition Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class, denounced Mrs. Thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet.
The British press, making a mountain out of a molehill, precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. Thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government. 

Behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute.
Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark.
Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy.
As there is an effort to "anchor the dollar" either to gold or other currencies, the dispute is worth examining. 

Until his resignation, Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark.
When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40%, Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark.
As a result, he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher, through a long and costly effort, had subdued. 

With inflation surging, the pound began falling against the mark.
To keep the exchange rate pegged, Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15%.
This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher's policies had created, producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls. 

Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher's political fortune, Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System, which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy.
This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind.
The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals, the media and the imagination, but are full of practical pitfalls. 

If the pound had been tied to the mark, the British would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates.
The reason is simple.
When a country cuts tax rates, it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency. 

It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax rates.
Edouard Balladur, the finance minister at the time, was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship. 

The price of attracting capital -- whether one's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit.
To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise.
This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit.
Consequently, Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit, renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row.
Little wonder that Mrs. Thatcher's opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. Lawson in office. 

It is extraordinary that the British Treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound.
The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40%, the flow abroad of British capital slowed, to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986.
This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account, a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency. 

Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s.
The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment, instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates.
This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle.
First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction.
Then, when the currency falls, interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate.
This policy is totally mindless, and Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies. 

Britain and all of Europe need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of Germany.
A unified Germany that remained within the Western alliance would give Germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified Europe would become vassals of the German state.
Unless the Soviet Union collapses, German reunification is likely to require Germany's neutralization.
The implications for Britain, France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson's resignation to be unfortunate. 

In the least, we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of tax-rate reduction on capital flows. 

Mr. Roberts was assistant Treasury secretary under President Reagan. 

The rationale for responding to your customers' needs faster than the competition can is clear: Your company will benefit in terms of market share, customer satisfaction and profitability.
In fact, managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than ever before.
However, for many, managing speed does not come naturally. 

"Most of us grew up believing in the axioms `Haste makes waste' and `Don't cut corners, ' ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed," says Dean Cassell, vice president for product integrity at Grumman Corp. "But in the real world, you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off.
Speed is a component of quality -- one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers." 

Companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations.
Managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed, and shift some responsibility for analyzing, improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees. 

One team at the Federal Express Ground Operations station in Natick, Mass., focused on a particularly time-sensitive operation: the morning package sort.
Every morning, tractor-trailer trucks arrive at the Natick Ground Station from Boston's Logan Airport, carrying the day's package load.
In peak periods that load may include 4,000 pieces.
The packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery, so couriers can be on the road by 8:35.
No customer is present at the morning package sort, but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction. 

"We're committed to deliver the customer's package by a stated time, usually 10:30," notes Glenn Mortimer, a Federal Express courier who led the Natick team. "The sooner our vans hit the road each morning, the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation." 

Following a problem-solving formula used by teams throughout Federal Express, members of the Natick team monitored their morning routine, carefully noting where and when the work group's resources were used effectively and where they were idle, waiting for others upstream in the process to send packages their way. 

"We suspected there was downtime built into our process.
But we didn't know just where it was until we completed our data gathering," Mr. Mortimer says. "We used the data to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good." The team even created a points system to identify those couriers and subgroups that were doing the most to reduce package-sort cycle time.
Winners of the friendly competition earn a steak dinner out with their spouses. 

"Monitoring shows that the Natick team's new system really does reduce cycle time for the morning package sort," reports James Barksdale, chief operating officer at Federal Express. "The vans leave at least 15 minutes earlier, on average, than they used to.
And service levels have increased to the point where they're consistently above 99%." 

A cross-functional team at Union Carbide's Tonawanda, N.Y., facility, which produces air-separation plants, followed a similar path to reduce manufacturing cycle time. 

"The team included craftsmen from the shop floor as well as engineering, scheduling and purchasing personnel," reports Alan Westendorf, director of quality. "First, they produced a flowchart detailing the process by which an air-separation plant actually gets built.
Then they identified snags in the process." 

The Tonawanda team determined that holdups for inspections were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical inspections and which were less critical or could be handled by workers already on the line.
The team then proposed modifications in their work process to management. 

"The streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways," Mr. Westendorf concludes. "First, we have better quality assurance than ever, because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work.
Second, we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product." 

At Grumman's Aircraft Systems Division, a cross-functional team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract.
The team was composed of representatives from engineering, manufacturing, corporate estimating, flight test, material, quality control, and other departments. 

"We needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal," says Carl Anton, configuration-data manager for Grumman's A-6 combat aircraft program. "But instead of gathering their input piecemeal, we formed the team, which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved." 

Armed with this shared understanding and requisite background information, each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal, submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule. "We cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly, because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team," Mr. Anton explains. 

The team trimmed more than two months from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals. "The team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate.
The result was a more thoughtful, complete and competitive proposal," Mr. Anton concludes. 

The successes achieved at Federal Express, Union Carbide and Grumman suggest that managing speed may be an underutilized source of competitive advantage.
Managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction.
They effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time.
And they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work.

When Westinghouse Electric Corp. shuttered its massive steam turbine plant in Lester, Pa., three years ago, it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its century-old power generation business. 

But now Westinghouse is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers.
And with its new venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., announced last week, it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas. 

For the first time since the mid-1970s, Westinghouse this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants.
Most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities, and Westinghouse believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years. 

Analysts agree, predicting that the revived market could significantly boost Westinghouse's bottom line in coming years. "Westinghouse's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner," says Russell L. Leavitt, of Salomon Brothers Inc.
The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the U.S. over the next decade.
Already this year, it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt plants from Intercontinental Energy Corp., among others. 

Westinghouse's own role as a supplier also is changing.
In the past, the company usually took token equity positions in power plants it supplied as a "kicker" to close deals. 

But last June's annnouncement that Westinghouse would put up all of the $70 million to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age.
Westinghouse's plant will provide electrical power to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & Chemical Co. 

"We haven't decided on a strategy yet, but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we're the developer or just the supplier," says Theodore Stern, executive vice president of the company's energy and utility systems group. 

At the same time, Westinghouse hopes its venture with Mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition, particularly in the U.S., from such European competitors as Asea Brown Boveri AG, Siemens AG, and British General Electric Co.
Under the agreement, Westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its Japanese partner, and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment. 

Westinghouse also jointly will bid on projects with Misubishi, giving it an edge in developing Asian markets.
In addition, the two companies will develop new steam turbine technology, such as the plants ordered by Florida Power, and even utilize each other's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations. 

"Even though we'll still compete against Mitsubishi, we can also work jointly on some projects, and we'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility," Mr. Stern contends. 

The Westinghouse-Mitsubishi venture was designed as a non-equity transaction, circumventing any possible antitrust concerns.
Westinghouse carefully crafted the agreement because the Justice Department earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint venture with Asea Brown Boveri. 

It is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which, unlike utilities, aren't regulated and therefore don't need government approval to construct new plants.
Westinghouse expects about half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at least the next six years. 

Despite shutdowns of the company's Lester and East Pittsburgh plants, the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in North Carolina. 

Still, Westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities, which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates, are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity. 

Even if that scenario occurs, Westinghouse figures it is prepared.
The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it hasn't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade.
John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer, says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company's AP600 nuclear power plant, which is under development. "Once we see an order, we expect it'll be on line by 2000." 

Stuart E. Eizenstat, a partner in the Washington law firm of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy, was named a director of this utility holding company, increasing board membership to 14. 

CRA Ltd. said it agreed to sell a 40% stake in its Howick coal mine in the state of New South Wales to Mitsubishi Development Pty. of Japan. 

The price wasn't disclosed.
The agreement is subject to government approval. 

RA acquired the Howick coal mine Oct. 20 when it bought British Petroleum Co. 's Australian coal interests for $275 million.
CRA said then that it was looking for a partner for the mine, which produces more than three million metric tons of coal a year. 

CRA is 49%-owned by RTZ Corp. of Britain. 

Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer of McGraw-Hill Inc., was elected to the board of directors of this electronics manufacturer.
He succeeds the retiring James W. Wilcock. 

Out of the mouths of revolutionaries are coming words of moderation. 

Here, at a soccer stadium near the black township of Soweto yesterday, were eight leaders of the African National Congress, seven of whom had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
Here were more than 70,000 ANC supporters, gathering for the first ANC rally inside South Africa since the black liberation movement was banned in 1960.
Here was the state security appartus poised to pounce on any words or acts of provocation, let alone revolution. 

But the words that boomed over the loudspeakers bore messages of peace, unity, negotiation and discipline. "We stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow," said Walter Sisulu, the ANC's former secretary general who, along with five of his colleagues, served 26 years in prison before being released two weeks ago.
Some members of the huge crowd shouted "Viva peace, viva." 

These are curious times in South African politics.
The government and the ANC, the bitterest of enemies, are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table.
Pretoria releases the ANC leaders, most of whom were serving life sentences, and allows them to speak freely, hoping that the ANC will abandon its use of violence.
The ANC leaders speak in tones of moderation, emphasizing discipline, hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps, such as freeing Nelson Mandela, the most prominent ANC figure, and unbanning the organization. 

The government of President F.W. de Klerk is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions.
Meanwhile, the many organizations inside the country that back the ANC are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and mobilize their supporters even though the state of emergency, which has severely curtailed black opposition, remains in force. 

The result is that the unthinkable and illogical are happening.
Six months ago, government approval for an ANC rally was inconceivable.
Equally inconceivable is that the ANC, given the chance to hold a rally, would extend a hand, albeit warily, to the government.
In a message read out at the rally, exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo, who can't legally be quoted in South Africa, said the country was at a crossroads and that Mr. de Klerk "may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our country" if he chooses a "path of genuine political settlement." 

Still, this doesn't mean that either the government or the ANC is changing stripes -- or that either has moved significantly closer to the other. 

The government may ease repression in some areas, but it still keeps a tight grip in others.
For instance, it releases Mr. Sisulu without conditions, yet his son, Zwelakhe, a newspaper editor, is restricted to his home much of the day and isn't allowed to work as a journalist. 

The ANC vows to keep up pressure on the government.
Speakers yesterday called on foreign governments to increase sanctions against Pretoria and urged supporters inside the country to continue defying emergency restrictions and racial segregation, known as apartheid. "We cannot wait on the government to make changes at its own pace," Mr. Sisulu said. 

Because the ANC remains banned, both the government, which approved the rally, and the organizers, who orchestrated it, denied it was an ANC rally.
They both called it a "welcome home" gathering.
Nevertheless, an ANC rally by any other name is still an ANC rally. 

The recently released leaders sat high atop a podium in one section of the stadium stands.
Behind them was a huge ANC flag and an even bigger sign that said "ANC Lives, ANC Leads." Next to them was the red flag of the outlawed South African Communist Party, which has long been an ANC ally.
In the stands, people waved ANC flags, wore ANC T-shirts, sang ANC songs and chanted ANC slogans. 

"Today," said Mr. Sisulu, "the ANC has captured the center stage of political life in South Africa." 

As a police helicopter circled overhead, Mr. Sisulu repeated the ANC's demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations: Release all political prisoners unconditionally; lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations; remove all troops from the black townships; end the state of emergency, and cease all political trials and political executions.
If these conditions are met, he said, the ANC would be prepared to discuss suspending its guerrilla activities. 

"There can be no question of us unilaterally abandoning the armed struggle," he said. "To date, we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations.
All their utterances are vague." 

Echoing a phrase from Mr. de Klerk, Mr. Sisulu said, "Let all of us who love this country engage in the task of building a new South Africa." 

The Canadian pig herd totaled 10,674,500 at Oct. 1, down 3% from a year earlier, said Statistics Canada, a federal agency. 

Sows for breeding and bred gilts totaled 1,070,000, down 2% from a year ago. 

(Jacksonville, Fla.) -- Charles Bates, president, chief executive and chief operating officer will resign from these positions and the board effective Oct. 31.

Roger L. Sutton, executive vice president, was appointed as the new president and chief operating officer.
Kerry P. Charlet will become executive vice president, and retain his positions as chief financial officer and treasurer. 

Like so many trends in the entertainment industry, the current spate of rape dramas on television seems to represent a confluence of high-mindedness and self-interest.
The former comes from the latest wave of political activism in Hollywood, especially around feminist issues such as abortion.
The latter comes from the perception, on the part of many people in network TV, that their only hope of keeping viewers from defecting to cable is to fill the airwaves with an increasingly raw sensationalism.
Put these together, and you get programs about rape. 

The best of the crop was last week's season premiere of "In the Heat of the Night," the NBC series based on a 1967 feature film about a black Philadelphia police detective in a small Southern town.
In the series, Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins) and his wife, Althea (Anne-Marie Johnson) have settled in Sparta, Miss.
Because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in Georgia, this episode -- in which Althea gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher -- does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime. 

Obviously, it's harder to establish a sense of place in a one-shot TV movie.
But tonight's offering, "Settle the Score" (9-11 p.m. EST, on NBC), doesn't even try.
This tale of a Chicago policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her 20 years earlier is supposed to be set in the Ozarks.
But it's more like an illustration of what Ben Stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry: "Fear of violence and animosity . . . because of race or religion, fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small-town people . . . produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers." 

The writer and executive producer of "Settle the Score," Steve Sohmer, is a graduate of Yale who participated in a PBS documentary, aired this summer, in which six members of the Yale class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation.
At one point in the documentary, Mr. Sohmer, who is Jewish, says he felt rejected by many of the Protestants and Southerners he met at Yale.
He quotes one student saying, "You're just the kind of Jewboy we Southerners can't stand." Mr. Sohmer confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now "a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of America." But is exile in Hollywood enough?
Not to judge by "Settle the Score," in which Mr. Sohmer seems to be settling a score of his own.
Of all the unflattering portraits of small-town America I've seen on TV, this film is the most gratuitously nasty.
The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate (Jaclyn Smith), and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk, a truly benighted pack of Southern Protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex. 

I mean, these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty Kate for the fact that when she was a teen-ager, someone tied her hands behind her back, thrust her head into a gunny sack, brutally raped and beat her, and then left her to die in a cold-storage room.
Her Pa (Howard Duff) is the kind of guy who, while saying grace at the supper table, pauses at the word "sin" and glares at the daughter he hasn't seen for two decades, because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold-storage room, and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of Chicago. 

People like Pa do exist, of course.
But in Mr. Sohmer's Ozarks, he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg.
Every man Kate encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical, viciously patronizing, revoltingly lecherous, or all three.
Add the fact that any one of them, including Pa, could be her attacker, and you have a setting that doesn't resemble small-town America, or even Hollywood's nightmare of small-town America, so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale," itself soon to be (you guessed it) a Hollywood movie. 

There are two exceptions: Josh (Jeffrey DeMunn), the local doctor who has always loved Kate; and Lincoln (Richard Masur), Kate's simple-minded but affectionate brother.
Josh makes clumsy passes at Kate when she's seething with anger and fear, but we know from the outset that he's not a member of the evil patriarchy.
How could he be?
He's the director of the local Planned Parenthood chapter.
As for Lincoln, if you can't guess why he's so sweet to his sister when everybody else hates her, then I'm not going to tell you. 

As for the women, they're pathetic.
Kate's Ma (Louise Latham) is a moral coward.
Her sister-in-law (Amy Wright) is a sniveling prude afraid that Kate will seduce all the married men in town, including a particularly loathsome fellow named Tucker, whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns, while he bullies Kate into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs.
At the very least, it would appear that Sis is a poor judge of masculine charm. 

Yet even these insulting caricatures are not as bad as the moral hypocrisy at the heart of "Settle the Score." In the aforementioned episode of "In the Heat of the Night," we saw Althea being attacked, but we weren't invited to enjoy the spectacle.
In Mr. Sohmer's film, by contrast, we are urged to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim, as the camera ogles Kate in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed-up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape. 

At this point, the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy.
Take the scene in which Kate stands naked by a lighted window, whispering to her hidden assailant, "Look all you want.
Starting tomorrow, I'm stalking you." Or the one in which she and Josh are stranded in the city, and, after insisting on separate motel rooms, she knocks on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape -- wearing nothing but a mini-slip and a push-up bra.
Surely the question is obvious.
With friends like Mr. Sohmer, do the feminists of Hollywood need enemies? 

Several of the New York Stock Exchange's own listed companies, led by giant Contel Corp., are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange's role in it. 

Claiming program trading has turned the Big Board into a "gambling casino," Contel Chairman Charles Wohlstetter said that he and at least 20 other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance.
The group, Mr. Wohlstetter said in an interview, wants to end the market's wild price swings that critics blame on computer-aided program-trading strategies.
The group will complain to Washington, to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the Big Board itself, he said. 

"They should call {the exchange} Trump East," charged Mr. Wohlstetter, the 79-year-old founder of Contel who's also a former investment banker and stock trader. "What is the mission of the financial community -- to help some scavengers or schemers, or help corporate America?" Contel is a $6 billion telephone and electronics company. 

Pressure has been building on the Big Board in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility, which many investors say is caused by program trading.
The market's Friday-the-13th plunge of 190 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Big Board's understated response to it, galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange.
Last month, program trading accounted for a record 13.8% of average daily Big Board volume. 

Mr. Wohlstetter, for example, said he wrote to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. about program trading after the 190-point Dow plunge, and as in previous queries, "what I get back is gobbledygook." He said he's upset that Mr. Phelan, trying to calm investors after the plunge, said that investors would simply have to get used to the market's big price swings.
The Big Board "is partly to blame {for the price swings}, because they're cowards," said Mr. Wohlstetter. "Their powerful members manage them." 

The focus of the outcry has been stock-index arbitrage, which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on.
Index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets, but critics say such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash. 

The Big Board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading.
Richard Grasso, Big Board president, last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents.
Privately, exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the Big Board, billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as London's.
It is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock "basket" product that allows big investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index in a single trade.
One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers, according to the exchange. 

Investors have complained for some time about program trading, particularly index arbitrage, to little avail.
But according to some Big Board traders, an organized campaign from exchange-listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes. "They won't fight the listed companies.
Now the assault is on," said one top trader.
The Big Board can't ban stock-index futures, of course, but it could ban use of its high-speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off.
The exchange put a bit of a damper on program trading when, last year, it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm's program-trading volume. 

Contel's Mr. Wohlstetter said the group of Big Board companies isn't ready to go public yet with its effort, and that he doesn't plan to be the leader once it is public.
However, he said he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support.
Among those Mr. Wohlstetter said he has been talking to are Sanford Weill of Primerica Corp., which is the parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.; GTE Corp. 's James Johnson, and ITT Corp. 's Rand Araskog. 

None of these chief executives were available for comment. 

Among the targets of the Big Board companies' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments.
For Contel's part, the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program-trading firms. 

It was just those kinds of ultimatums that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate.
Kemper Corp. 's Kemper Financial Services unit said it cut off Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, Oppenheimer and General Electric Co. 's Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit.
All of the firms except Kidder, which is the second-biggest program trader on Wall Street, quickly announced pull-backs from index arbitrage. 

Kidder officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading.
Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of Kidder's own brokers, he believes index arbitrage doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole." However, pressure on Kidder's parent, GE, could change Kidder's policy.
GE Chairman John Welch has been "besieged with phone calls" complaining about his unit's program trading, according to a person close to him. 

Trustcorp Inc. will become Society Bank & Trust when its merger is completed with Society Corp. of Cleveland, the bank said. 

Society Corp., which is also a bank, agreed in June to buy Trustcorp for 12.4 million shares of stock with a market value of about $450 million.
The transaction is expected to close around year end. 

APARTHEID FOES STAGED a massive anti-government rally in South Africa. 

More than 70,000 people filled a soccer stadium on the outskirts of the black township of Soweto and welcomed freed leaders of the outlawed African National Congress.
It was considered South Africa's largest opposition rally.
Walter Sisulu, the ANC's former secretary general who served 26 years in prison before being released two weeks ago, urged peace, negotiation and discipline.
President de Klerk's government permitted the rally, and security forces didn't interfere. 

Pretoria's approval of the demonstration and the ANC's conciliatory tone appeared aimed at setting up negotiations to give blacks political rights. 

CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS BACKED Bush's criticism of Nicaragua's Ortega. 

While lawmakers haven't raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras following Ortega's weekend threat to end a truce, Senate Majority Leader Mitchell said on NBC-TV that Ortega had made "a very unwise move." Minority Leader Dole plans to offer a resolution tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan president, whose remarks came during a celebration in Costa Rica marking regional moves to democracy.
Ortega cited renewed attacks by the U.S.backed rebels. 

Lawmakers must decide next month whether the Contras will get so-called humanitarian aid under a bipartisan agreement reached in March. 

Spain's Socialist Party claimed victory in nationwide elections, saying it had retained its parliamentary majority by one seat.

When the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s, Akzo NV fell out of bed. 

Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business, which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company's sales, led to huge losses and left Akzo's survival in doubt.
It wasn't until the early 1980s that Akzo nursed itself back to health. 

Now, as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms, Akzo says it is in far better shape to cope.
Investment analysts generally agree. 

Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants, Akzo has spent 3.9 billion guilders ($1.88 billion) on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance.
During the same period, the company has sold about 1.6 billion guilders of assets. 

The fibers business, whose products go into textiles, carpeting and myriad industrial uses, now accounts for only 20% of Akzo's sales. "We have definitely become less cyclical," Syb Bergsma, executive vice president-finance, said in an interview. 

Still, Akzo hasn't yet found a way to achieve another goal: a large presence in the U.S. market for prescription drugs.
Mr. Bergsma said prices for U.S. pharmaceutical companies remain too high, making it unlikely that Akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area.
But he said Akzo is considering "alliances" with American drug companies, although he wouldn't elaborate. 

An indication of Akzo's success in reshaping itself will come Thursday when it reports third-quarter results.
Analysts expect the company to show profit of about 225 million guilders, up 9% from 206.3 million guilders a year earlier. 

A bigger test will come next year if, as many analysts expect, bulk chemical prices slump in Europe. 

"Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit," said Jaap Visker, an analyst at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV.
He figures Akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year.
The bank projects Akzo will show per-share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990, up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988. 

At James Capel & Co. in London, analyst Jackie Ashurst notes that Akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products.
For example, Akzo has only minor petrochemical operations, is small in plastics and doesn't make fertilizers. 

Thus, while Akzo profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics, it has less to fear from the current slump. 

The company is exposed to bulk chemicals, however.
Although bulk-chemical prices have begun falling in the U.S., they are generally stable in Europe, Mr. Bergsma said.
A decline may come in the first half of 1990, he said, but the market doesn't appear on the verge of a severe downturn. 

To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles, Akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals, which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals.
Akzo's biggest move in this area was the 1987 acquisition of Stauffer Chemical Co. 's specialty chemical business for $625 million. 

In a less glamorous field, Akzo is the world's biggest producer of industrial salt, used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as melting ice.
Akzo also makes products derived from salt, such as chlorine and caustic soda. 

In the fibers division, profit remains weak, largely because of persistent overcapacity.
But Akzo is still slimming down: It recently announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the Netherlands and West Germany. 

Although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak, Akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses, such carbon fibers and aramid, extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as bullet-proof vests. 

Akzo's Twaron aramid fiber is a distant second to Du Pont Co. 's Kevlar, which dominates the market.
Mr. Bergsma said world-wide industry sales of aramid fibers are expected to total about $500 million this year.
Sales growth of 10% a year seems possible, he said, and Akzo expects its Twaron business to become profitable in 1990. 

Akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints, auto finishes and industrial coatings.
In August, for example, it completed the $110 million acquisition of Reliance Universal Inc., a U.S. maker of industrial coatings for wood, metals and plastics, from Tyler Corp. Mr. Bergsma said Akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale. 

For Akzo's drug business, where profits have shown litle change for the past five years, Mr. Bergsma predicted moderate profit growth.
Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan.
Mr. Bergsma said Akzo hopes to have approval to sell its Marvelon pill in the U.S. in 1992. 

Akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests, generic drugs and veterinary products.
Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth, Mr. Bergsma said.
Among the leading products is a flu shot for horses. 

E.W. Scripps Co. said it has acquired a Georgia cable television company and a Massachusetts publishing firm.
Terms on both deals weren't disclosed. 

The media company said it purchased Cable USA Inc., a privately held cable television system in Carroll County, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta.
The system is still under construction and will serve a market of 7,600 homes. 

The company also has acquired Sundance Publishers and Distributors Inc., a family owned producer and distributor of educational materials in Littleton, Mass. 

The Belgian consumer price index rose a provisional 0.1% in October from the previous month and was up 3.64% from October 1988, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said. 

The index, which uses a base of 1981 as 100, was calculated at 140.91 points in October, from 140.74 in September. 

Annual inflation rose to 3.64% in October from 3.55% in September. 

Belgium's inflation has been rising steadily for the past year, but the ministry said the latest rise is slower than gains in September and August. 

Pacific First Financial Corp. said it signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire the construction lending unit of Old Stone Bank of California. 

Terms haven't been finalized, but the transaction is expected to close by year end, Pacific First said. 

Old Stone's construction lending portfolio includes about $250 million in real-estate loans outstanding.
The unit has 30 employees in four California offices, the company said. 

Pacific First owns Pacific First Federal Savings Banks and other financial services firms. 

For the sixth time in as many years, Continental Airlines has a new senior executive.
Gone is D. Joseph Corr, the airline's chairman, chief executive and president, appointed only last December. 

Mr. Corr resigned to pursue other business interests, the airline said.
He could not be reached for comment. 

Succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be Frank Lorenzo, chairman and chief executive of Continental's parent, Texas Air Corp. Mr. Lorenzo, 49 years old, is reclaiming the job that was his before Mr. Corr signed on. 

The airline also named Mickey Foret as president.
Mr. Foret, 44, is a 15-year veteran of Texas Air and Texas International Airlines, its predecessor.
Most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at Texas Air. 

Top executives at Continental haven't lasted long, especially those recruited from outside.
But Mr. Corr's tenure was shorter than most.
The 48-year-old Mr. Corr was hired largely because he was credited with returning Trans World Airlines Inc. to profitability while he was its president from 1986 to 1988.
Before that, he was an executive with a manufacturing concern. 

At Continental he cut money-losing operations, which helped produce a modest profit in this year's second quarter.
But Mr. Corr, a stunt pilot in his spare time, was understood to be frustrated by what he regarded as limited freedom under Mr. Lorenzo. 

While not officially an executive at Continental during Mr. Corr's tenure, Mr. Lorenzo is known for keeping close tabs on Texas Air's operating units.
Continental is Texas Air's flagship and was built painfully to its present size under Mr. Lorenzo after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in 1986. 

It's unclear what role, if any, Mr. Lorenzo's recent exploration of a possible sale of a stake in Continental had in Mr. Corr's departure.
One source familiar with the airline said, however, that Mr. Corr wasn't informed in advance during the summer when Mr. Lorenzo began discussions with potential buyers. 

During his tenure, Mr. Corr attempted through a series of meetings to inform managers of some of the company's future plans, traveled widely to talk to employees and backed training sessions designed to improve the carrier's image. 

Mr. Foret is one of a handful of executives Mr. Lorenzo has relied on over the years.
Previously, he had served in financial planning positions at the company's Eastern Airlines unit.
Another longtime ally, Phil Bakes, currently heads Eastern, now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
Mr. Bakes previously had a turn at running Continental. 

Among the other alumni are Stephen Wolf, now chairman of UAL Inc., and Thomas Plaskett, president of Pan Am Corp. 

A seat on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was sold for $416,000, down $36,000 from the previous sale Oct. 

Seats currently are quoted at $410,000 bid, $425,000 asked. 

The record price for a full membership on the exchange is $550,000, set March 9, 1989. 

Crossland Savings Bank's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Crossland closed at $5.25, down $1.875, a 26% decline. 

A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because, under the proposed guidelines, its $380 million of preferred stock doesn't meet the "core capital" criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989.
He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance. 

Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan.
It wouldn't identify the bankers. 

Additionally, Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $175.5 million, or $13.44 a share, compared with net income of $27.1 million, or $1.16 a share, a year ago.
A major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $143.6 million of goodwill. 

The spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused Crossland to revise its business objectives and, consequently, to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions.
Crossland recorded an additional $20 million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter. 

Net interest income for the third quarter declined to $35.6 million from $70.1 million a year ago.
However, non-interest income rose to $23.5 million from $22 million.
Third-quarter loan originations dropped sharply to $663 million from $1 billion a year ago. 

Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered the rating on Crossland's preferred stock to double-C from single-B-minus and placed it on CreditWatch for possible further downgrade.
It also placed on CreditWatch for possible downgrade other securities, including the double-B-minus/B rating of Crossland's certificates of deposit and the single-B rating of its senior subordinated capital notes.
About $518 million of debt is affected. 

Wives May Not Benefit 

When Men Do Chores 

WHEN HUSBANDS take on more housework, they tend to substitute for chores done by the kids rather than by the wife. 

Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18.
The women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate share each did. 

Not unexpectedly, wives, whether working or non-working, did by far the most -- about 80% of the shopping, laundry and cooking, and about two-thirds of housecleaning, washing dishes, child care and family paper work.
Only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less than half. 

But the researchers found that while children's household tasks eased the mother's burden appreciably, the husband's helping hand "appears to lighten the children's load almost on a one-for-one basis and to reduce the wife's responsibility only modestly." 

This pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples.
In these families, husbands took on 80% more chores than in couples with only grammar school education.
But the kids with highly educated parents did 68% less housework than those in less-educated families. 

"It is clear," Ms. Waite says, "that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the wife/mother.
Her share decreases, but only slightly." 

Nursing Home Patients 

Apt to Be Private Payers 

FAR FEWER elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed, two recent studies declare. 

State governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills.
Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance.
But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that "a surprisingly small proportion" -- only about 10% -- of residents start out as private payers but "spend down" to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged. (Another one-third are already on Medicaid when they enter the nursing homes, a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated.) 

But a remarkably high percentage -- over half -- are private payers throughout their stay, even a fairly lengthy one.
About one-third pay out of their own pockets, while the rest are covered throughout by Medicare, private insurers or the Veterans Administration.
Both reports are based on several thousand patients sampled in a 1985 nationwide government survey. 

The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution, however, that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration, and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays.
Moreover, they note, those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes, using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives. 

Reagan Era Young 

Hold Liberal Views 

THE REAGAN generation young men and women reaching political maturity during Ronald Reagan's presidency -- are firmly liberal on race and gender, according to NORC, the social science research center at the University of Chicago. 

Many political analysts have speculated that the Reagan years would produce a staunchly conservative younger generation.
NORC's most recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more pro-Reagan and pro-Republican than other adults.
But, says chief investigator Tom Smith, this "does not translate into support for conservatism in general or into conservative positions on feminist and civil rights issues." 

Answers to a dozen questions in the 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989 national surveys reveal that men and women in the 18 to 24 age bracket are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were the 18 to 24 year olds in NORC's polling in the early 1970s and early 1980s.
They were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the 1986 through 1989 surveys. 

For example, 66% of the 18 to 24 year olds in the four latest surveys favored an "open housing" law prohibiting homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers.
That compares with 58% of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55% in the 1972 through 1975 surveys. 

Asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the claim that men are emotionally better suited to politics than women, 70% of the Reagan generation disagreed, compared with under 60% of younger men and women in the earlier years.
Odds and Ends 

SEPARATED and divorced men and women are far more likely to be smokers than married persons, the Centers for Disease Control discovers. . . . Graduate students are taking longer than ever to get their doctor of philosophy degrees, the National Research Council says.
It estimates the time between college graduation and the awarding of a Ph. D. has lengthened by 30% over the past 20 years, with the average gap now ranging from about 7.4 years in the physical sciences to 16.2 years in education. 

Personal spending, which fueled the economy's growth in the third quarter, was clearly slowing by the end of the period, raising questions about the economy's strength as the year ends. 

Personal spending grew 0.2% in September to a $3.526 trillion annual rate, the Commerce Department said.
It was the smallest monthly increase in a year. 

At the same time, personal income was held down by the effects of Hurricane Hugo, which tore through parts of North and South Carolina in late September.
The department said personal income rose 0.3% in September to a $4.469 trillion rate but would have climbed 0.6% had it not been for the storm.
Among the economic effects of the hurricane was a sharp drop in rental income. 

The figures came a day after the government released a report showing that consumer spending propelled U.S. economic expansion in the third quarter while -- on an inflation-adjusted basis -- business investment slowed, government spending declined, and exports were flat. 

But the new statistics show that by September, the burst in spending seemed to be tapering off.
Many economists expect the weakness to continue. 

"I think the consumer has pretty well played himself out," said David Littman, senior economist at Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit. 

"I don't think there's a lot in the wings" in other sectors of the economy to keep growth above 1%, he said.
In the third quarter, the economy grew at a moderate 2.5% annual rate. 

In August, personal income rose 0.3% and spending grew 0.9%. 

Analysts have attributed much of the summer's spurt in spending to bargain car prices at the end of the model year.
Car sales slackened in September after the 1990 models were introduced.
According to the Commerce Department report, spending on durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years, including cars -- declined by $6.2 billion. 

The nation's savings rate was unchanged in September at 4.9% of after-tax income, far below the 5.6% it reached in July. 

All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations. 

Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on personal income.
The figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in trillions of dollars. 

General Electric Co. 's rail-car leasing unit completed the $178.5 million purchase of similar businesses from Leucadia National Corp. and Brae Corp., 74%-owned by Leucadia, the sellers said. 

The buyer was GE Capital Railcar Services, Chicago, a major owner of railway equipment and part of the GE Capital operations. 

Leucadia, New York, estimated it had a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $57 million, including its part of Brae's gain.
Because of tax-loss carry-forward, Leucadia said it expects to escape taxes on "a substantial portion of the gain." 

The estimated gain for Brae is $15 million, including a tax credit of $7 million, the sellers said. "The credit for income taxes is a result of having provided deferred income taxes applicable to the sold assets at the higher income tax rates in effect in prior years," the sellers said. 

The envelope arrives in the mail.
Open it and two soulful eyes on a boy's brown face peer out from the page, pleadingly.
Does the tyke have a good mind about to be wasted?
Is he a victim of Gramm-Rudman cuts?
No, but he's endangered all the same: His new sitcom on ABC needs a following to stay on the air. 

ABC hasn't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years, and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate. "Homeroom," a show about a black ad executive who gives up the boardroom for a fourth-grade classroom, is flunking the ratings test.
So producers Alyce and Topper Carew spun their Rolodexes and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign.
By wooing a core black audience they figure they might keep the show alive at least until the spring semester. 

Using direct mail for a TV show is like fishing for whale with a breaded hook.
It just isn't done.
But employing this kind of gut-wrenching plea to black consciousness makes it even more unusual.
Still, Mr. Carew thinks he can reach a good chunk of the three million-plus black homes he needs by mailing to the almost 10,000 blacks who form what he calls "the grapevine." 

"The grapevine isn't organized, but you and I know it exists," says Mr. Carew, referring to the often uncannily small world of black professionals and community leaders. 

"This is a very personal, ethnic style," Mr. Carew says. "I want people in the barber shops and the beauty shops and standing in line at the rib joints to be talking about the show.
I want white America to talk about it, too, but I'm convinced that the grapevine is what's happening." 

ABC says it is aware of the producers' action, but the mailing was sent without the network's blessing.
The letter, in fact, takes a jab at ABC for being a laggard in black programming. 

Meanwhile, as the Sunday evening show struggles to stay afloat against the tough competition of "Murder, She Wrote," the grapevine idea is threatening to turn into a weed: The tactic apparently has inspired sample viewings, but accolades are slow in coming. 

Doug Alligood, a black advertising executive who tracks black viewing patterns, gives the Carews an "A" for marketing moxie, but isn't alone in his lukewarm reaction.
Some shows just don't impress, he says, and this is one of them. 

Karstadt AG said sales for its domestic group rose 4.6% in the first nine months of 1989 from a year earlier. 

The West German retailing group also said that the results of the first three quarters suggest it will meet its profit goal for the year.
Earnings at the department-store division, which generates the bulk of profit, should remain at least stable, while income at the mail-order and tourism units is likely to fall slightly from 1988, the company said. 

Karstadt didn't give any group sales or profit figures for the first nine months. 

Analog Devices Inc. said it may purchase as many as one million of its common shares over the next several months. 

Analog also said that a one million share buy-back program announced in March is substantially complete.
The company, which makes integrated circuits and other electronic parts, now has about 47 million common shares outstanding. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Analog Devices closed at $8.875, up 25 cents. 

Despite politicians' hand-wringing about the federal budget, the government ended fiscal 1989 with a $152.08 billion deficit, about the same as the two previous years. 

Even White House budget director Richard Darman had trouble finding a silver lining in the report. "I suppose you could say the good news is that the deficits are not heading up," he said, "but you can't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we're not." 

The federal deficit was $155.15 billion in 1988 and $149.69 billion in 1987. 

The 1989 deficit would have been nearly $10 billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as Congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on Sept. 30.
Because the Resolution Trust Corp. couldn't spend the money fast enough, the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal 1990. 

Nevertheless, the 1989 deficit still exceeded the $136 billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law by $16 billion, a reminder of that law's shortcomings. 

The law sets a deficit target of $100 billion for fiscal 1990.
A partisan fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of 1990 deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt, triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. 

The White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year.
Neither side showed any sign of retreating. 

Meeting with reporters Friday, Mr. Darman again said he would rather live with across-the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit-reduction bill like the one passed by the House, which would increase spending in future years. 

Underscoring the size of the deficits of the past few years, the Treasury report showed that for the first time interest paid on the public debt -- $240.86 billion -- exceeded spending on Social Security, the single largest government program. 

In all, federal outlays amounted to $1.143 trillion in 1989, up 7.5% from the previous year, the Treasury said.
Federal revenues rose 9% to $990.79 billion. 

The Treasury said a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year didn't turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared.
The Treasury marked up its forecast by $17 million in July, but that proved to be about $5 billion too optimistic. 

The government ran a deficit of $6.16 billion in September, compared with a surplus of $10.17 billion in September 1988. 

Outlays for the month totaled $105.39 billion, up from $87.57 billion a year earlier.
The increase reflects spending on the S&L rescue as well as payroll and Social Security checks normally issued in October that were issued in September this year because Oct. 1 fell on a Sunday. 

Revenues were $99.23 billion, up from $97.74 billion a year earlier. 

A two-day meeting of representatives of Cocom, the 17-nation group that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries, didn't take any substantive decisions on trimming the list of items under controls.
Nor did it ease restrictions on exports to Poland and Hungary, according to U.S. officials who attended the talks. 

The U.S. had been under pressure from several Cocom members, especially France, West Germany and Italy, to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools, which those countries argued were now widely available to East Bloc countries from non-Cocom members.
For several years some European countries have complained that outdated Cocom lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to Western security. 

Some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for Hungary and Poland as they move toward more democratic rule, just as special treatment had been agreed on for China.
But U.S. officials said representatives at the meeting decided that this was "a matter for further discussion at future meetings." They added that "all of us (Cocom members) look at the changes in Hungary and Poland in a positive way, but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study." The officials also said the meeting agreed to continue treating China as a special case, despite the recent repression of dissent there, but to offer no further concessions. 

The U.S. officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, all the Cocom members agreed on "the continuing need for this organization," which was founded 40 years ago at the start of the Cold War.
The officials said the meeting agreed to continue working toward "streamlining" Cocom's restricted products list, and to improve procedures for punishing companies that don't comply with the export restrictions.
The officials said this meeting "put in motion" procedural steps that would speed up both of these functions, but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter. 

The closely held supermarket chain named Frank Nicastro vice president and treasurer.
The 47-year-old Mr. Nicastro joins Grand Union from Singer Co., where he was treasurer. 

Ferro Corp. said it will buy back as many as one million common shares.
The maker of chemical and industrial materials didn't say how much it would pay or when it would make the transactions. 

Ferro also said it would cancel the unused portion of a 1987 buy-back plan for administrative reasons.
The plan calls for the company to buy back 2,250,000 shares, which reflects a 3-for-2 stock split this year.
So far the company had bought back 1.6 million shares. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Ferro closed at $25.25, down 50 cents. 

When Michael S. Perry took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event, more than 500 executives packing the room snapped to attention. 

Mr. Perry, who runs Unilever Group's world-wide personal-care business, paused to scan the crowd. "I see we have about half the audience working for us," he said, tongue in cheek. "The other half, we may have before long." 

Members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously; their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions.
First Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant, spent $2 billion to acquire brands such as Faberge and Elizabeth Arden.
It now holds the No. 3 position at U.S. department-store cosmetic counters.
Then Procter & Gamble Co. agreed to buy Noxell Corp. for $1.3 billion.
That acquisition, to be completed by year end, will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines, making P&G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets. 

It's not so much the idea of acquisitions that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring: P&G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper, sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout, sparking fear.
Though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling Promise margarine and Tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics, there's little doubt they will shake up the industry. 

For now, both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans.
But industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies.
Likely changes include more emphasis on research, soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing.
But some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business.
Estee Lauder Inc., Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives.
Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year, and since most products can be easily copied by competitors, they're loath to test them with consumers. 

"Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods, it doesn't mean they are packaged goods," says Leonard Lauder, chief executive of Estee Lauder. "They're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars." 

In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses, Unilever and P&G are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits.
Both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research.
P&G, in particular, rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing.
Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field. 

P&G already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business.
Consider Oil of Olay, which P&G acquired as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985.
The moisturizer, introduced in 1962, had a dowdy image. "Oil of Olay brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged," says David Williams, a consultant with New England Consulting Group. 

P&G set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin.
It also redesigned Oil of Olay's packaging, stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look.
Moreover, P&G shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her mid-30s vowing "not to grow old gracefully." The company says sales have soared. 

Goliaths like Unilever and P&G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals.
Next year, Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy, says George L. Bunting Jr., chairman of Noxell.
Without P&G's backing, Noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $5 million to $7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands.
Packaged-goods companies "will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive," Mr. Bunting says. 

Further consolidations in the industry could follow.
Rumors that Unilever is interested in acquiring Schering-Plough Corp. 's Maybelline unit are widespread.
Unilever won't comment; Schering, however, denies the brand is for sale. 

The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics.
While the two are among the world's biggest advertisers, most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads.
Instead, they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases.
Estee Lauder, for example, spends only an estimated 5% of sales on advertising in the U.S., and Mr. Lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy. 

The most dramatic changes, however, probably will come in new-product development.
Nearly 70% of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets, according to Andrew Shore, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
That figure has been inching up for several years.
As the trend continues, demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase.
This fall, for example, L'Oreal Group, ordinarily a high-end line, rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called Plenitude, which retail for $5 to $15. 

The packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products.
Unlike the old-line cosmetics houses, Unilever and P&G both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products.
P&G, in fact, is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition.
Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year, for example, after P&G introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics. 

That's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands. "There will be more emphasis on quality," says Guy Peyrelongue, chief executive of Cosmair Inc., the U.S. licensee of L'Oreal. "You'll see fewer gimmicks." 

But success for Unilever and P&G is far from guaranteed, as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business.
In the 1970s, several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies, including Colgate-Palmolive Co., Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies.
Industry consultants say only Schering-Plough, which makes the mass-market Maybelline, has maintained a meaningful business.
Colgate, which acquired Helena Rubenstein in 1973, sold the brand seven years later after the brand languished. 

Unilever already has experienced some disappointment.
The mass-market Aziza brand, which it acquired in 1987 along with Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., has lost share, according to industry analysts. 

The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing, where Unilever is concentrating its efforts, may prove even more treacherous.
In this niche, makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions.
Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned, careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important.
And cultivating a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than $15 for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own. 

John Lehman's editorial-page article on the Pentagon as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population ("In the Pentagon, the Undead Walk," Oct. 18).
The media's treatment of the Defense Department during the Vietnam War, the Carter administration's denigration of the military, and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. Oliver North have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there.
The resulting haunted house tends to reward followership, not leadership, it creates guilt about wearing the uniform, and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts' role, i.e., to be able to win if called on. 

Perhaps the Halloween season is a good time for Congress to be looking at funding for some ghostbusting equipment.

Where does Mr. Lehman get off castigating Gen. George Marshall for muscling in on naval prerogatives?
Ever since the days of Alfred Thayer Mahan (U.S. naval officer and naval historian) and Teddy Roosevelt the Navy has been the service most favored by Washington officialdom.
Mr. Lehman overlooks the fact that the Navy possesses its own air force (the carrier fleet) and its own army (the Marines), which in turn has its own air force. 

Of course these turf battles are unseemly, wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security, but Mr. Lehman seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer.

I agree with Mr. Lehman 100%! 

Isn't this the same guy who resigned as Navy secretary because he couldn't get his 1,000-ship Navy? 

I personally do not want to hasten Mr. Lehman's demise, but I can see him figuring prominently in his own article.

Birmingham, Mich. 

Switzerland's most famous raider says he isn't one.
Werner K. Rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly. 

And in little more than a decade of being friendly -- and at the same time rocking the staid Swiss business community with some U.S.-style wheeling and dealing -- the 46-year-old Mr. Rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire.
He achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established European companies. 

His latest coup: September's masterminding of the five billion Swiss-franc ($3.07 billion) merger between Adia S.A., the world's second-largest temporary employment agency, and Inspectorate International S.A., a Rey-controlled product-inspection company. 

Shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late November.
But approval is almost certain since Mr. Rey and a friendly Adia management are in control. 

After the transaction, Mr. Rey estimates the value of his 20% stake in the new company, to be held by his Omni Holding AG, will be about 1 billion Swiss francs.
This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs.
Mr. Rey bought a controlling stake in Inspectorate for 18 million Swiss francs in 1982, building up the little-known engineering company with European and U.S. acquisitions. 

"I like to succeed," says Mr. Rey during a recent morning of working at home, which he also likes.
Home is an estate with green meadows opening onto Lake Geneva and a low-slung house whose rooms overlook the water and offer a view of the French Alps.
In the corner of his reception room is a delicate antique desk piled high with dossiers.
There is a small Renoir on the wall.
Zurich-based magazine Bilanz lists Mr. Rey as having a fortune of about 1.5 billion Swiss francs.
Writes Bilanz: "No one in Switzerland ever came so far so fast . . . He was simply the first in this country to realize that treasures were just lying around waiting to be picked up.
In short: Rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets." 

However, the Swiss financial press in general, as well as many analysts, have had a hard time making up their minds about Mr. Rey and his un-Swiss ways. 

For Switzerland's most prestigious newspaper, Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Mr. Rey seems destined to remain the "former Bally raider," an image that has proved hard to overcome. 

In 1976, as an upstart in the eyes of Switzerland's establishment, Mr. Rey laid the foundations of his present-day prominence with an unheard-of raid on Bally, the country's traditional shoemaker. 

Sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in London, where he was working as a financial consultant, he learned that a large packet of Bally's shares was up for sale.
Looking into Bally, he could hardly believe what he saw: a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs; it had 7,000 employees. 

Investing four million Swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million Swiss francs from his parents and his wife, Mr. Rey acquired 20% of Bally's shares. 

But such tactics were alien to Switzerland in 1976, and still aren't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain.
Eventually, Mr. Rey was forced to sell his Bally shares to the weapons maker Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the Swiss old boys' network. 

Mr. Rey made 50 million Swiss francs on the sale. "Bally was not an unfriendly takeover," he insists.
Buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible, Mr. Rey contends. "I bought from willing shareholders." 

Nevertheless, Mr. Rey has been very careful since then to make sure his moves are welcome.
And he has worked to shed his raider image. 

In 1979, his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the Swiss metals works Selve, based in Thun.
With the nonferrous metals business undermined in Switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs, this looked like a dull undertaking.
But Mr. Rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country's major producers; the increased efficiency has perked up the industry. 

Three years later, machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A. was to become part of the Rey empire.
Once again the company's future looked less than rosy.
But after restructuring under new management, the profits began rolling in. 

A major boost to Mr. Rey's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60% of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks.
They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad.
In 1987, Mr. Rey bested leading publishing houses to take over Switzerland's Jean Frey AG, a major producer of magazines and newspapers. 

And with the recent acquisition of 30% of Winterthur-based machinery manufacturer Gebrueder Sulzer AG, Mr. Rey has enjoyed the status of white knight.
Sulzer preferred him to financier Tito Tettamanti, whose secretive raid on the company's stock had led to a bitter battle. 

Meanwhile, as such strategic investments have mounted, the merchant-banking arm of Mr. Rey's Omni Holding has been busily buying and selling dozens of companies, often after a financial or corporate restructuring. 

Today, this branch of Mr. Rey's empire runs under the name Omnicorp Offering Services and handles mergers and acquisitions, placement of securities and real estate.
In its portfolio are such diverse companies as United Kingdom-based Air Europe; Checkrobot Inc., a U.S. company that makes supermarket checkout machines; Norment Industries, a U.S. manufacturer of securities systems; Com Systems Inc., a U.S. regional telephone company; and major real-estate projects in the U.S. and Europe. 

For financial analysts, reading Omni's accounts is a tough challenge. "Companies move in and out," says Helga Kern of KK Swiss Investment. 

Financial analysts note that Mr. Rey is attracted to companies that are undervalued on the basis of their real-estate interests.
In August, Omni unexpectedly bought Inspectorate's 80% stake in Harpener AG of West Germany, a land-rich company.
The internal transaction within the Rey empire puzzled Harpener's small shareholders, but analysts say it makes sense for Inspectorate-Adia to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help. 

Mr. Rey says the move is yet another example of his conservatism.
He explains that companies with real estate give "security." The real estate can be used, he points out, as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development. 

He says he wants to "influence" but not "manage" companies. "I don't want to be like {financier Alan} Bond and the other Australians.
I don't want companies to be built around me as a person.
I want them to stand alone." 

RJR Nabisco Inc. said it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A.'s Nestle Foods unit for $370 million. 

The sale, at a higher price than some analysts had expected, helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts Nestle's 7% share of the U.S. candy market to about 12%. 

The candy businesses had sales of about $154 million last year, which was roughly 12% of total revenue for RJR's Planters LifeSavers unit, according to a memorandum distributed by RJR's owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., to bankers last December. 

The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park, Ill., which employs about 800 workers. 

The sale, which had been expected, is part of KKR's program to pay down $5 billion of a $6 billion bridge loan by February.
Roughly $2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales, and RJR expects to use another $2 billion from the pending, two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit.
That sale, however, could still fall through if financing problems develop.
Thus, it remains crucial for RJR to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands. 

Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a "significant step" in the company's divestiture program, as well as a "a strategic divestiture." Since KKR bought RJR in February for $25 billion of debt, it has agreed to sell nearly $5 billion of RJR assets.
RJR's executives have said they will dispense with certain brands, in particular, that aren't leaders in their markets. "RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses," Mr. Gerstner said Friday. 

Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S., but RJR's overall share of the roughly $5.1 billion market is less than 5%.
Nestle's share of 7% before Friday's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc., which have about 40% and 36% of the market, respectively. 

"This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way," said Lisbeth Echeandia, publisher of Orlando, Fla.-based Confectioner Magazine. "For them, it makes all kinds of sense.
They've been given a mandate from Switzerland" to expand their U.S. chocolate operations.
Nestle S.A. is based in Vevey, Switzerland. 

The new candy bars, "make an important contribution to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit," said C. Alan MacDonald, president of Nestle Foods in Purchase, N.Y. 

The current account deficit on France's balance of payments narrowed to 1.48 billion French francs ($236.8 million) in August from a revised 2.1 billion francs in July, the Finance Ministry said. 

Previously, the July figure was estimated at a deficit of 613 million francs. 

Seasonally adjusted figures for August weren't available because of a recent strike that has disrupted the ministry's data collection. 

CMS Energy Corp. said it would begin paying a 10-cent-a-share quarterly dividend, the company's first since 1984. 

Consumers Power Co., now the main unit of CMS Energy, ran into financial problems over its $4.2 billion Midland nuclear plant, which was abandoned as a nuclear facility in 1984 because of construction delays and high costs.
CMS is nearly done converting the Midland plant to a gas-fired cogeneration facility at a cost of $600 million. 

CMS management said Thursday that they planned to recommend paying a modest dividend when the board of directors met Friday.
The dividend will be paid Nov. 22 to shares of record Nov. 7. 

The company suffered a loss of $270 million in 1985, but its financial situation has been improving since then.
CMS said it earned $237.8 million in the first nine months of 

The American Stock Exchange said a seat was sold for $165,000, unchanged from the previous sale Oct. 13.

Joseph P. Jordan, 52 years old, becomes president, chief executive officer and a director of the bank company.
Mr. Jordan, formerly president and chief executive of Fishkill National Bank in Beacon, N.Y., succeeds Donald Broderick, who died at 52 in an automobile accident. 

If this battle were a movie, the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common. 

In the opener, Sony Corp. would agree to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. in a transaction valued at close to $5 billion.
Shortly after that, Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million and offer its co-chairmen, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the chance to run Columbia.
Mr. Peters would fly to New York with the intention of telling Warner Communications Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross that Guber-Peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for Warner. 

That's where the two scripts would diverge.
In affidavits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in connection with the $1 billion breach-of-contract suit Warner brought against Sony for hiring the two producers, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters tell one story.
Warner tells another. 

In the affidavits, Mr. Peters says he was "shocked" when Mr. Ross refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them.
Mr. Peters claims he reminded Mr. Ross that Robert Daly and Terry Semel, the top executives of the Warner Brothers studio, had "repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept" an offer such as Sony's.
In response, Mr. Peters says, Mr. Ross referred to his colleagues at Warner with an "obscenity" and said: "Tell them that they don't have a job.
You can take them with you." 

Warner denies Mr. Ross ever said any such thing, and, in fact, denies virtually everything Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits.
Tomorrow, Warner will file another batch of documents contending that "the essence of everything these guys are saying is basically lies," says Warner's chief outside counsel, Stuart Rabinowitz.
Thursday, a judge is scheduled to rule on Warner's motion seeking to block the Guber-Peters duo from going to Columbia. 

The battery of legal documents filed in the past week in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this Hollywood dogfight.
But they also make it clear that the first thing a judge will have to decide is which, if any, version of events in this morass is fiction, and which fact. 

The matter may never even be tried in court.
Warner says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations, but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired.
Warner, which is in the process of merging with Time Warner Inc., says it is willing to settle the matter out of court.
So far, however, Sony hasn't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands. 

Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters don't have much to gain from a protracted battle.
Sony, for its part, could decide that the cost of a Warner settlement or court fight is too high, choosing instead to find someone else to run Columbia, although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.
In that case, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not suffer financially, but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with Warner. 

At the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between Warner and the two producers, but other murkier issues will play a big role.
Sony and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up.
Warner denies such an agreement was made, and disputes the Guber-Peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter. 

Just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides' current business dealings.
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits that Warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at Warner, notably the Sylvester Stallone film "Tango and Cash." 

Mr. Peters says in his affidavit that the movie's staff was told last week that Warner was "taking over" the picture, and another producer would be giving all of the orders.
Over his objections, Mr. Peters says, the film's release date was moved up "by many months" to December, and plans for a soundtrack "worth millions of dollars" were dropped. 

Hubert de la Bouillaire, an editor on the film, backs Mr. Peters in a separate sworn declaration.
Mr. de la Bouillaire says Warner Brothers production president Mark Canton called him Oct. 19 and said Mr. Peters is "off the picture.
If he calls you up, just tell him everything is fine." The editor also says the new producer on the film, Bruce Baird, told editors to screen the picture without telling stars Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell or Mr. Peters. "The less they know, the easier it is for us.
If someone asks, just lie and tell them it will be done," Mr. de la Bouillaire says Mr. Baird told them. 

That, says Warner's Mr. Rabinowitz, is "a total 100% lie." The movie, he says, is in its post-production stages of "cleaning up the film." He says Mr. Peters and Mr. Guber, as the contractual producers with consultation rights, have been invited to screenings and to give their input on the film.
Dozens of Guber-Peters staffers are still working on the Warner lot and consulting on various projects on a "daily basis," the attorney says. 

Mr. Guber, in his affidavit, says that when he advised Warner President Terry Semel of the Sony offer at lunch on Sept. 25, Mr. Semel "hugged and congratulated me, and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company." 

Mr. Guber says he brought to lunch a release document Warner had agreed to in 1988, when he and Mr. Peters made an aborted bid to buy part of MGM/UA Entertainment Co. to run the MGM studio.
Mr. Guber says he had crossed out "MGM" with a red pen and written in "Columbia," giving the document to Mr. Semel. "Mr.
Semel said absolutely nothing to indicate Warner would have any objection to our assuming management positions at Columbia," Mr. Guber says. 

Mr. Semel, in his affidavit, doesn't mention any hugging or congratulating.
He says he told Mr. Guber he couldn't sign any documents and that "the deal, although apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters, would have a very negative impact on Warner." He said he would contact Mr. Ross and Warner Brothers Chairman Robert Daly and that, in a conference call, the three agreed they couldn't let the producers out of their contract. 

Mr. Ross, in his own affidavit, says he and Mr. Daly instructed Mr. Semel to tell the producers Warner wouldn't terminate their agreement. 

Mr. Guber says that Mr. Semel did convey that information and that Mr. Semel said Mr. Ross was "crazy because of the Time deal," meaning, Mr. Guber says, that Mr. Ross "did not want to communicate to his new merger partner, Time Inc., that Warner's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances." 

Mr. Guber also says in his affidavit that Mr. Daly "told us that even if Sony did not want us, Warner's relationship with us already was irreparably damaged, that there was no way `to put the egg together, ' and that it would sue Sony for tons of money." 

Moreover, Mr. Guber claims, Mr. Semel told him that Mr. Ross probably wouldn't object "if it were anybody other than Sony.
But Sony is a problem." The Guber-Peters side has said Warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge Japanese company controlling important segments of the U.S. entertainment business. 

Some in Hollywood suggest Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters took encouragement from Warner studio executives such as Mr. Semel and Mr. Canton too literally.
According to this theory, Warner executives, hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers, encouraged Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company.
But the Warner executives in their affidavits deny ever telling the producers they could get out of their written contract. 

Mr. Rabinowitz, the Warner attorney, says the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract. "They are like a mini-studio; they have 50 projects in development for Warner," he says. 

But Mr. Guber indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used.
For example, he says that since 1985, he and Mr. Peters have developed over 85 movie projects, and Warner has "passed" or chosen not to produce at least 76. 

As for the projects remaining at Warner, Mr. Guber says, "Mr.
Semel informed me that Warner's producers have already started a `feeding frenzy' for our projects." 

Small businesses say a recent trend is like a dream come true: more-affordable rates for employee-health insurance, initially at least.
But then they wake up to a nightmare. 

The reasonable first-year rates can be followed by increases of 60% or more if a covered employee files a major claim, they complain.
Insurance premiums for one small Maryland concern went up 130% in less than two years, the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk. 

"There's a distinct possibility that I may lose my job over this," the employee, Karen Allen, of Floor Covering Resources, Kensington, Md., recently told a congressional hearing.
She said her employer can't afford the rate increases, and she fears she won't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment. 

For employee and employer alike, the worry is widespread.
Surveys repeatedly show that small-business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns. 

The House Energy and Commerce Committee's health subcommittee, headed by Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California, is looking into complaints that small businesses not only can't keep reasonably priced employee-health insurance if claims are filed, but often can't get coverage at all if a worker is termed medically uninsurable. 

"I have an old-fashioned name for people in that position: sick people who need health insurance," Rep. Waxman says. "What we're seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance: collect premiums from the healthy, dump the sick and let them pay their own bills." Some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies. 

The concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small-business market.
As larger companies increasingly self-insure, or use reserves to pay their own workers' medical bills, the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them. 

"Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick, but it's a roll of the dice," says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau, a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide. "One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant, and rates go up 40% to 60%.
Small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness." 

In addition, the group says some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce, hemorrhoids and overweight. 

The Health Insurance Association of America, an insurers' trade group, acknowledges that stiff competition among its members to insure businesses likely to be good risks during the first year of coverage has aggravated the problem in the small-business market.
But it says that rapid rate increases are directly tied to the soaring cost of health care. 

Some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market.
They say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do.
But the general practice makes it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups, thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums. 

"I'm not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty," Robert Patricelli of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told Mr. Waxman's panel. "You can't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace." 

Rep. Waxman and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts have proposed regulation to deal with the problem.
The proposal is just part of legislation that would require businesses to provide health benefits, an idea that is strongly opposed by small business who say it would just compound the insurance-cost problems. 

But small-business lobbyists say they support the idea, included in the Kennedy-Waxman bill, of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating, which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group, and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low-risk small companies as clients. 

But first on the list of priorities, says the National Federation of Independent Business, is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items, such as psychiatric care, in basic health plans.
Such requirements, they argue, make it difficult to provide a basic, low-cost health-benefits package. 

"Before the state of Wisconsin mandated that mental-health care be covered, there were only 70 mental-health clinics in the state; now there are 400," says Carolyn Miller, an NFIB lobbyist.
She contends that similar mandates have driven up insurance costs 20% in Maryland and 30% in California. 

The insurance-industry association also strongly disagrees with the proposed community rating, which "doesn't save one dollar," argues James Dorsch, HIAA's Washington counsel. "It just makes healthy businesses subsidize unhealthy ones and gives each employer less incentive to keep his workers healthy." Mr. Dorsch says the HIAA is working on a proposal to establish a privately funded reinsurance mechanism to help cover small groups that can't get insurance without excluding certain employees. 

The complexities of the insurance problem make the outcome difficult to predict.
But to Ms. Allen, the employee whose back problem triggered a huge insurance-rate increase, the issue was simple. "What good is having health insurance," she asked, "when it's so expensive that it becomes impossible to keep after only one major claim?" 

The world had a big yuk recently when the Soviets reported a rash of UFO landings, one of them bringing tall aliens who glowed in the dark to Voronezh.
It is the opinion of Timothy Good, author of "Above Top Secret: The World UFO Cover-Up" (Quill/William Morrow, 592 pages, $12.95), that the world laughs too fast. 

Here is a bible for UFO watchers, complete with pictures of people who say they've had personal relationships with aliens.
One photo shows a woman sporting a scar she says was made by a laser beam (a low-caliber weapon, from the looks of the wound). 

So far anyway, our alien visitors seem more intent on brightening our skies than pulverizing us.
Mr. Good devotes much serious space to the events of Feb. 25, 1942, when American gunners spotted strange lights in the sky above Los Angeles.
Air-raid sirens sounded the alarm at 2:25 a.m., summoning 12,000 air wardens to duty.
Soon all hell broke loose. 

Ground batteries, targeting an odd assortment of aircraft traveling at highly unusual speeds, opened up a furious fusillade.
The sky filled with 12.8-pound shells, several of which fell back to Earth, destroying homes and buildings.
When the smoke cleared, six people were dead (three from heart attacks), and everyone wondered what in the world they were shooting at. 

Mr. Good, who documents these things as best he can, provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from Chief of Staff George C. Marshall to President Roosevelt: "1,430 pounds of ammunition," he wrote his commander in chief, were expended on "unidentified aircraft," flying at speeds as slow as 200 mph and elevations between 9,000 and 18,000 feet. 

Well, thousands of Californians on the scene insisted the ammo had been uselessly aimed at a large, hardy UFO, but you will just have to make your own decision about such sightings.
One thing's for sure: There have been a ton of them, and greater beings than the editors of the National Enquirer have shown interest.
Gerald Ford, a fairly down-to-earth fellow, once sent a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee recommending that "there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomenon.
I think we owe it to the American people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject." 

Jimmy Carter went further in a 1976 campaign promise: "If I become president, I'll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public, and the scientists.
I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one. . . ." 

But you know about campaign promises.
It still doesn't look like governments are coughing up everything they know.
Still, despite their efforts to convince the world that we are indeed alone, the visitors do seem to keep coming and, like the recent sightings, there's often a detail or two that suggests they may actually be a little on the dumb side. 

For instance, witnesses in Voronezh say the pinheaded behemoths and their robot friend, after strolling around the city park, left behind some rocks.
Now why, you have to ask yourself, would intelligent beings haul a bunch of rocks around the universe?
Or land in Russia so often.
In a 1961 incident, a Soviet mail plane disappeared off the radar screen just after radioing its position to ground control in Sverdlovsk.
A search party soon found the unscathed aircraft in a forest clearing much too small to have allowed a conventional landing.
What's more, the seven mail personnel aboard were missing. 

Again, you have to ask the obvious question: Why would intelligent beings kidnap seven Soviet mailmen? 

Speculation as to the nature of aliens will no doubt continue until we wake up one morning to find they've taken over "The Today Show," the way they overwhelm an entire town in Jack Finney's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, 216 pages, $8.95).
Maybe some of our talk-show hosts and anchors have already been taken over?
The point of this 1955 novel, which spawned two movies, is that the soulless pod people replicated by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human folks. 

Another guy who thinks they're out there and closing fast is Whitley Strieber, whose new novel, "Majestic" (Putnam, 317 pages, $18.95), takes a look at a reported 1947 UFO crash near the Roswell Army Air Field in a New Mexico desert.
Mr. Strieber knows a lot about aliens.
He even had sex with one -- sort of, and not intentionally -- as readers learned in his "Communion" (a book recently described in the New York Times as a "nonfiction best seller"). 

The way Mr. Strieber tells it in his earnest prose, the intelligence officer who found the craft's strange debris was forced by the government to call the flower-inscribed scraps parts of a weather balloon.
The apparent crash became top secret, and the alien creatures went away upset with the rude ways of human beings.
We lost our chance to communicate with sweet-natured visitors "about four feet tall {who} looked as though they were made of puffed-up marshmallow."

October was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost, the official Soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation's media.
For one of the superstars of glasnost, Vitaly Korotich, editor of the trail-blazing weekly Ogonyok, Friday, Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation. 

He had been summoned to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, after he finished his lunch at the Savoy Hotel, an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow-beating: Eight-foot-tall Rubenesquely naked ladies float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with cherubs, all surrounded by gilt laid on with a pastry chef's trowel and supported by marble corinthian columns whose capitals are fluting fountains of gold. 

Why had Mr. Korotich been called? "I told my driver," he said, "that he was taking my butt to the Central Committee so they can . . ." whack, whack, whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm. "They feel the need from time to time to `educate' me." 

And indeed, as he later reported, that was the import of the meeting.
Anxious allies of President Mikhail Gorbachev are cautioning media leaders to take it easy, to be careful not to do anything that could be used by Mr. Gorbachev's opponents.
The government is nervous.
According to Mr. Korotich, who was present, Mr. Gorbachev's publicized tongue-lashing of the press on Oct. 13 was more of a plea: "Be careful boys; use good judgment.
We're standing in gasoline, so don't smoke!" 

U.S. and northern European diplomats confirm Mr. Korotich's assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger.
In fact, a very high-ranking Soviet official told an American official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated.
The day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador, the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda, Victor Afnasjev, was replaced by a college classmate of Mr. Gorbachev's.
Brezhnevite holdovers have more to fear from Mr. Gorbachev than the verbal spanking he gave to the press. 

At the end of the very week in which Mr. Korotich was called to the Central Committee, Ogonyok was again demonstrating its independence by printing a poll that showed that 35% of the Soviet population, a plurality, believed that Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms, perestroika, would result in only insignificant change. 

A good measurement of the popularity of ice-breaker journals like Ogonyok is circulation.
When Mr. Korotich took it over in 1986, it sold 250,000 copies; today it sells 3.4 million.
Pravda, meanwhile, has retained only 57% of its 1986 readership. 

Glasnost has made celebrities of men like Mr. Korotich.
Prevented by the Communist Party from getting on its slate of nominees for the new Supreme Soviet, he stood as an independent candidate for Congress from his native Ukraine and won with 84% of the vote.
The same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the Party, he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the Korotich party. 

But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are, there is a fragility to glasnost.
Censorship isn't a Marxist invention.
The czars were no civil libertarians.
As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines.
It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives.
So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society.
It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history.
It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point. 

What is that point?
Will Ogonyok begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika? "I'd be destroying myself," replies Mr. Korotich, who then asks, "What would that accomplish?" His answer reveals his vulnerability -- it also draws the line that Soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of Western culture.
It is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders. 

Mr. Ayers is editor and publisher of the Anniston, Ala., Star. 

Crane Co. said it holds an 8.9% stake in Milton Roy Corp., an analytical-instruments maker, and may seek control of the company. 

Crane, a maker of engineered products for aerospace, construction, defense and other uses, made the disclosure in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 

In the filing, Crane said that in the past it considered seeking control of Milton Roy, of St. Petersburg, Fla., through a merger or tender offer and that it expects to continue to evaluate an acquisition from time to time.
Crane officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment. 

Crane holds 504,200 Milton Roy shares, including 254,200 bought from Sept. 14 to Thursday for $15.50 to $16.75 each.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Milton Roy shares leaped $2, to $18.375 each, while Crane sank $1.125, to $21.125 a share. 

John M. McNamara, chief financial officer of Milton Roy, said the company has no comment on Crane's filing. 

Milton Roy recently fended off unsolicited overtures from Thermo Electron Corp., a Waltham, Mass., maker of biomedical products.
Milton Roy disclosed in May that it was approached for a possible acquisition by Thermo Electron, which agreed to purchase Milton Roy's liquid-chromatography line for $22 million in February.
Thermo Electron acquired some 6% of Milton Roy's common stock before throwing in the towel and reducing its stake in early September. 

Gabelli Group began raising its Milton Roy stake in July, and holds 14.6%, according to a recent SEC filing.
It hasn't made merger overtures to the board. 

Earlier this month, Milton Roy signed a letter of intent to acquire Automated Custom Systems Inc., Orange, Calif., and its sister operation, Environmental Testing Co., in Aurora, Colo.
The companies are automotive-emissions-testing concerns. 

Under the terms, Milton Roy will pay an initial $4 million for the operations and additional payments during the next four years based on the earnings performance of the businesses. 

In the nine months, Milton Roy earned $6.6 million, or $1.18 a share, on sales of $94.3 million. 

We're sorry to see Nigel Lawson's departure from the British government.
He is a politician with the courage of true conviction, as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40%.
But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing, especially if it works as he no doubt intends -- by forcing Prime Minister Thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved. 

The early omens, we admit, scarcely suggest so wholesome an outcome.
The Fleet Street reaction was captured in the Guardian headline, "Departure Reveals Thatcher Poison." British politicians divide into two groups of chickens, those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling.
So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues: Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters, the counterpoint of the Chancellor's difficulties, who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher. 

The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates, conservative, free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps.
There are the strict monetarists, who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates.
There are the supply-side globalists, who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates.
And there are the twin-deficit Keynesians, who predict/advocate devaluations to balance trade flows.
This is a problem not only for Prime Minister Thatcher but for President Bush, as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the Federal Reserve and the Mulford Treasury. 

In the British case, Mr. Lawson is the closest thing in London to a supply-side globalist.
He not only slashed marginal tax rates, initially sparking fresh growth in Britain, but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates, indeed joining the European Monetary System.
While no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else, Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist, inclined to defend floating rates to the death. 

To make matters even more confusing, the earlier U.S. experience made clear that Mr. Lawson's tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain's international accounts and the value of sterling.
They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest, producing sudden capital inflows.
By accounting definitions, this had to produce a sudden trade deficit.
As in the U.S., it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling, that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates, M-Whatever. 

At this point, the options were: Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates, as Sir Alan surely advised, and forget the soaring pound.
To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit, a policy Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous.
Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate, as the Chancellor argued, and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS. 

Faced with a similar situation, Paul Volcker let the dollar soar, (though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation).
But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector, laying the seeds of protectionism.
Mr. Lawson, though not allowed to join the EMS, chose to "shadow" the deutsche mark.
He reaped inflation along with rapid growth, no doubt validating Sir Alan's predictions in the Prime Minister's mind.
But more recently, the pound has been falling with high inflation, which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates Mr. Lawson deployed to stop it. 

So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of Albion.
We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. Lawson's resignation, and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy, John Major.
To begin with, we should note that in contrast to the U.S. deficit, Britain has been running largish budget surpluses.
In pursuit of this mystery, Keynesian adepts and twin-deficit mavens need not apply. 

We should also add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it.
Unlike the U.S., Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages.
The wage stickiness, which OECD studies confirm is particularly high in Britain, gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation.
Inflation is easier to spark and harder to control. 

We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience.
Nearby Paul Craig Roberts, a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies, argues the case for Sir Alan.
Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates, though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound, not restrain a strong one.
We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling, but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise.
Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean, perhaps measured by M-Whatever, but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity. 

The globalists tend to think Mr. Lawson ran onto technical reefs.
In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial, for example, and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-DM rate.
For that matter, perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency.
We sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of West Germany.
Perhaps the shock would have been less if they'd fixed to another low-tax, deregulated, supply-side economy. 

Alan Reynolds of Polyconomics adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus.
Those who can shake Keynesian ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation, indeed, it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply.
Mr. Reynolds also notes that since British banks have no reserve requirements, high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession. 

We would add that in political terms, Mrs. Thatcher's problem was failing to decide between the Chancellor and her adviser.
In the end, neither policy was followed, and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery.
In particular, "shadowing" a currency is anything but fixing; it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility.
All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy.
Better to have a true monetarist policy, just for the experience. 

So Mr. Lawson had to resign.
In the end his move was sparked by remarks in excerpts from Sir Alan's autobiography in The American Economist, a 10,000-circulation academic journal.
But it was the underlying situation that became intolerable. 

What Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do now remains to be seen.
They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy, that is to say, stagflation.
This cannot be solved by provoking a further downturn; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation.
Our advice is this: Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts, and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money (which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do).
This was the version of supply-side economics that, in the late 1970s and early '80s, worked in America and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts Britain today. 

After days of intense but fruitless negotiations, a federal judge last week threatened to convert William Herbert Hunt's Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy case into a Chapter 7 liquidation. 

Judge Harold C. Abramson raised the possibility after talks to end a feud between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into roadblocks. 

If the case is converted to Chapter 7, what remains of the oil tycoon's once-vast estate -- now believed to have a value of less than $125 million -- would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the Internal Revenue Service, whose claim for $300 million in back taxes has priority in the case.
Hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing, according to attorneys involved. 

While admitting such a move would be "devastating" to most creditors, Judge Abramson told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on Mr. Hunt's shrinking estate and about the fact that, following voting by creditors, none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form. 

"It would be a shame to have a Chapter 7 after all the progress in this case," said Judge Abramson.
Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, a company continues to operate under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.
Under Chapter 7, the assets of a company are sold off to pay creditors. 

Despite his reluctance to take the latter step, the judge indicated he would move quickly after hearing testimony later this week in the bitter dispute between Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Minpeco S.A., a minerals concern owned by the Peruvian governmemt. 

The Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit, which is seeking repayment of a $36 million loan, has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of Minpeco, which won a $132 million judgment against Mr. Hunt, his brother Nelson Bunker Hunt and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market in 

While claiming that penalties, legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more than $250 million, Minpeco has agreed to settle for an allowed claim of as much as $65.7 million.
But even that is disputed by Manufacturers Hanover which, in alliance with the IRS, contends that Minpeco has already collected more than its actual damages from other defendants in the silver-conspiracy case. 

Under prodding from Judge Abramson, a Minpeco executive flew in from Peru last week to talk directly with executives from Manufacturers Hanover on a settlement.
Despite long private sessions in both New York and Dallas, the two sides ended the week "6,000 miles and many dollars apart," according to attorney Hugh Ray, who represents Manufacturers Hanover.
Meanwhile, inside the courtroom, the judge said he would fine attorneys for the two creditors $50 every time they referred to each other with terms such as "liar" or "slime." 

All three major creditors -- the IRS, Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover -- voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization plan proposed by Mr. Hunt.
A reorganization plan proposed jointly by the IRS and Manufacturers Hanover was stalled by a negative vote from Minpeco.
The mineral concern's own reorganization plan met a similar fate after opposition from the IRS and Manufacturers Hanover.
Neither plan is dead, however, and the judge could force creditors to accept some version of them after ruling on the Minpeco-Manufacturers Hanover dispute. 

Meanwhile, settlement negotiations continue between Mr. Hunt and the IRS, which has already reached a tentative agreement with Nelson Bunker Hunt.
The two sides have been far apart on how much Herbert Hunt will continue to owe the government after his assets are sold. 

Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading. 

Their motivation, however, has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks.
The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is "making it tough for traders to make money," declares Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. 

Stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The S&P 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies. 

The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it amounted to more than 13% in September.
Estimates from traders put it at less than 5% of Nasdaq's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares. 

Other market-maker gripes: Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market.
Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity.
Moreover, the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses them. 

Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market.
But the big, often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it. 

Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, acknowledges that he wasn't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising. 

"We weren't as concerned until they became sell programs," says Mr. DaPuzzo, who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility.
Shearson Lehman, however, executes program trades for clients. 

Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, in addition to Shearson, do program-trade OTC stocks.
Shearson, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs say they do so only for customers, however.
Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients' accounts. 

Of course, there were sell programs in past years, too, but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days.
That's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash, when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled.
Market makers, to cut costs, slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren't selling. 

And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress.
On days when prices are tumbling, they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will.
In such an environment, market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares. 

"It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you're going to lose," says Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin. 

But this skittishness, Mr. Antolini says, is creating liquidity problems in certain OTC stocks. "It's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers don't want to {take the orders}.
No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks." 

Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, agrees that program trading is hurting the market's efforts to bring back small investors.
But, he observes, while makers suffer losses when program trading drags the market down, they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher. "Sometimes {traders} lose sight of that," he says. 

The OTC stocks in the S&P 500 include Nasdaq's biggest, such as Apple Computer, MCI Communications, Tele-Communications and Liz Claiborne.
These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index.
When the computers say "sell," the composite tumbles as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

The problem, market makers say, is that while the industrial average and the S&P 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in, the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind. 

Eight trading days after Oct. 12, the day before the stock market plunge, for instance, the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 4.3%, compared with 3.3% for the S&P 500, 3.5% for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and 3.6% for the industrial average.
This gap eventually closes, but slowly.
Three days later, as of Friday's close, the Nasdaq Composite was down 6%, compared with 5.9% for the industrial average, 5.7% for the S&P 500 and 5.8% for the Big Board Composite. 

The main reason for this lag is that individual investors own 65% of the OTC market's capitalization, according to Mr. Hardiman, much more than on the Big Board.
Such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs, market makers say. 

Friday's Market Activity 

The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 5.39, or 1.2% to 452.76 on Friday.
For the week, the index dropped 3.8%. 

Weakness in big technology stocks hurt the composite as well as the Nasdaq 100 Index, which fell 1.4%, or 6.43, on Friday, to 437.68.
The Nasdaq Financial Index lost about 1%, or 3.95, to 448.80. 

Friday's trading volume totaled 132.8 million shares.
The average daily share turnover for October is almost 148 million shares. 

LIN Broadcasting surged 4 5/8 to 112 5/8; LIN and BellSouth sweetened their merger agreement in an attempt to keep shareholders from tendering their shares to McCaw Cellular Communications.
McCaw, which dropped 2 1/2 to 37 3/4, has offered $125 a share for a majority of LIN's shares. 

The revised LIN-BellSouth agreement boosts the dollar amount of the special dividend LIN promises to pay shareholders.
LIN now plans to dole out $42 a share in cash, up from the earlier $20 amount. 

Intel eased 1/8 to 31 7/8.
The semiconductor concern said the interruption in shipment of its 80486 computer chip will be brief and have little impact on the company's earnings.
The stock fell 7/8 Thursday amid concerns over problems discovered with the chip.
Intel told analysts that the company will resume shipments of the chips within two to three weeks. 

Weisfield's rocketed 9 1/2 to 39 after the jewelry store operator said it is in preliminary discussions, with a party it wouldn't identify, regarding the possible acquisition of the company. 

Starpointe Savings Bank rose 3 to 20 after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Dime Savings Bank of New York's $21-a-share acquisition of Starpointe. 

Kirschner Medical fell 4 to 15.
The company said its third-quarter earnings will probably be lower than the 16 cents a share it reported last year, despite a rise in the company's revenue.
Kirschner earned $376,000 on revenue of $14.5 million in the 1988 quarter.
The company blamed a number of factors for the earnings decline, including softer sales of joint-implants. 

While Wall Street is retreating from computer-driven program trading, big institutional investors are likely to continue these strategies at full blast, further roiling the stock market, trading executives say. 

Bowing to a mounting public outcry, three more major securities firms -- Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. and Oppenheimer & Co. -- announced Friday they would suspend stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts. 

PaineWebber Group Inc. announced a pullback on Thursday from stock-index arbitrage, a controversial program-trading strategy blamed by many investors for encouraging big stock-market swings. 

Though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility, most Wall Street firms remain open to handle program trading for customers.
Trading executives privately say that huge stock-index funds, which dwarf Wall Street firms in terms of the size of their program trades, will continue to launch big programs through the stock market. 

Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon Capital Management are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of Wall Street, trading executives say.
These huge stock-index funds build portfolios that match the S&P 500 stock index or other stock indexes, and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits. "They will do it every chance they get," said one program-trading executive. 

Consequently, abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon, they say.
In fact, without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts, the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant. "More customers may come to us now," said James Cayne, president of Bear Stearns Cos. 

Executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987 crash.
They noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility. "The issues that are (now) being raised, in classic anti-intellectual fashion, fly in the face of a number of post-crash studies," said Fred Grauer, chairman of Wells Fargo Investment Advisers. 

A Bankers Trust spokesman said that the company's investment arm uses stock-index arbitrage to enhance investors' returns.
Officials at Mellon Capital were unavailable for comment. 

Stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole.
Many money managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the S&P-500's returns. 

Some stock-index funds are huge.
Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, for example, managed $25 billion in stock investments tracking the S&P 500 at the end of June, according to Standard & Poor's Corp. Mr. Grauer said $2 billion of that is used in active index arbitrage. 

Stock-index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool, but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock-index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from price differences. 

The 190-point plunge in the stock market Oct. 13 has heightened concerns about volatility.
And while signs of an economic slowdown, softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market's recent weakness, many investors rushed to blame program trading for aggravating market swings. 

The Wall Street firms' pullback followed their recent blacklisting by several institutional investors.
Last Tuesday, Kemper Corp. 's Kemper Financial Services Inc. unit said it would no longer trade with firms committed to stock-index arbitrage, including the three that later suspended stock-index arbitrage trading on Friday.
Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Founders Asset Management Inc. also cut off brokerage firms that engage in program trading. 

Though it is still doing stock-index arbitrage trades for customers, Morgan Stanley's trading halt for its own account is likely to shake up firms such as Kidder, Peabody & Co. that still do such trades for their own account.
Morgan Stanley has consistently been one of the top stock-index arbitrage traders in recent months. 

Indeed, Morgan Stanley's president, Richard B. Fisher, said the firm is putting up money to form a group of regulators, investors and investment banks to find out if stock-index arbitrage artificially induces stock-market volatility. 

"We have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating artificial volatility," Mr. Fisher said. "There is no question that investor confidence (in the stock market) is critical." 

Joining the call for some kind of study or regulatory action, Merrill Lynch & Co. recommended program-trading reforms late Friday, including higher margins on stock-index futures and greater regulatory coordination.
Separately, Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to "enhance stabilization." Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security.
Current rules permit investors to put up less cash for futures than for stocks. 

Some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility.
These rules, they say, permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks, which frequently knocks the two markets out of line. 

Stock-index arbitrage, because it sells the more "expensive" market and buys the "cheaper" one, attempts to reestablish the link between the stock and futures markets, and the adjustments are often abrupt.
But unequal trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks, which invites frequent bouts of stock-index arbitrage in the first place. 

"There has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis," said Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty-First Securities Corp. "One agency should have the authority over all equity products." 

Georgia-Pacific Corp. offered to acquire Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. for $58 a share, or about $3.18 billion. 

The offer capped a week of rumors that Georgia-Pacific, an Atlanta-based forest-products company, was considering making a bid for Nekoosa, a paper-products concern based in Norwalk, Conn. 

Executives at Nekoosa couldn't be reached, and officials at Georgia Pacific declined to comment.
Analysts, however, were surprised because the tender offer appeared unsolicited. "It's quite a bombshell," said one, adding that the offer could spark a period of industry consolidation. 

The two companies would appear to be a logical fit because of their complementary lines, and analysts described the offer, representing a 36% premium over Nekoosa's market price, as fair.
Nekoosa closed yesterday at $42.75, up $2.75, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

But industry observers still questioned whether Georgia Pacific will ultimately prevail. "You have to watch out for counterbids," said one analyst. "International Paper or Weyerhaeuser could step in." 

The bid for Great Northern, a notice of which appears in an advertisement in today's Wall Street Journal, is the first big takeover offer since the collapse of a $6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. Oct. 13. 

That collapse, following on the heels of disarray in the market for high-risk, high-yield bonds, cast doubt on the entire takeover business, which has fueled both big profits among Wall Street securities firms and big gains in the stock market generally. 

While Georgia-Pacific's stock has outperformed the market in the past two years, Nekoosa has lagged the market in the same period. 

Yesterday's rise in Nekoosa's share price came on volume of 786,700 shares, four times the daily average. 

According to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, options trading in Nekoosa was also heavy, ranking only behind International Business Machines Corp. and UAL in volume on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. 

According to the Value Line Investment Survey, demand for Nekoosa's commodity paper has weakened, prompting earnings to decline by 6.6% in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.
Value Line added, "With discounts widening on business papers, and with newsprint and corrugated shipments flat, we expect negative earnings comparisons through next year." 

By contrast, Value Line said Georgia-Pacific "is in a comparatively good position to deal with weakening paper markets," because its production is concentrated not in the Northwest but in the South, where it should be able to avoid some of the cost pressures from rising wood-chip prices.
Also, it isn't exposed to the weakening newsprint business, and is strong in the less-cyclical tissue business. 

The purchase of Nekoosa would easily eclipse Georgia-Pacific's $530 million acquisition of Brunswick Pulp & Paper Co. last year.
That acquisition, which also included the assumption of $135 million in debt, was designed to allow Georgia-Pacific to capitalize on the strong demand for softwood pulp, as well as reduce its exposure to the housing market. 

Wasserstein Perella & Co. is the dealer-manager for the offer, which will expire Nov. 29, unless extended. 

In the aftermath of the Beijing massacre on June 4, economists advanced wildly divergent views on how Hong Kong would be affected. 

Among the most upbeat was BT Brokerage (Asia) Ltd.
In a June 5 reaction, the Bankers Trust Co. unit proclaimed the economy "shockproof." 

Others were more cautious.
In a July analysis titled "From Euphoria to Despair," W.I. Carr (Far East) Ltd., another securities firm, said that eroding confidence might undermine future economic development. 

Today, with business activity in Hong Kong staggering along at an uneven pace, the economy itself seems locked in a struggle between hope and fear. 

Manufacturers have survived the turmoil in China largely unscathed.
Signs of revival seem evident in Hong Kong's hard-hit hotel sector.
But in the stock and real-estate markets, activity remains spotty even though prices have regained much of their lost ground.
Waning demand reported by importers, retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that is sharply tightening its belt. 

As many economists and businessmen see it, those incongruities underscore a paradox that seems likely to bedevil the economy throughout the 1990s.
That paradox is Hong Kong's economically rewarding yet politically perilous relationship with China. 

As a model of capitalist efficiency on southern China's doorstep, Hong Kong's prospects look good.
China's land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry.
China-bound freight streams through the territory's port.
In the decade since the communist nation emerged from isolation, its burgeoning trade with the West has lifted Hong Kong's status as a regional business center.
These benefits seem secure despite China's current economic and political troubles.
But to Hong Kong, China isn't purely business.
It is also the sovereign power that, come 1997, will take over this British colony.
China's leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 Hong Kong.
That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on Marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation's democracy movement. 

Outflows of people and capital from Hong Kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s.
A widely held assumption all along has been that, given its robust economy, Hong Kong will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows.
With interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since June 4, that assumption no longer seems so safe. 

Investment and emigration plans take time to come to fruition.
Only four months have passed since the Beijing massacre, and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact.
The only consensus is that more money and people may leave Hong Kong than had been thought likely.
This expected blow has cast a pall over the economy's prospects.
The question, as many people see it, is how long such uncertainty will last. 

Maureen Fraser, an economist with W.I. Carr, a subsidiary of France's Banque Indosuez, believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997.
It may experience an upswing or two in between.
But with local investors shaken by China's political and economic turmoil, she says, a genuine recovery may not arrive until Hong Kong can prove itself secure under Chinese sovereignty. 

"Investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to 1997," she says. "Over the next few years, I would advise caution." 

In a soon-to-be published book on the territory, a political economist, Miron Mushkat, has derived three future scenarios from interviews with 41 Hong Kong government officials and businessmen.
Nearly half of them argue that Hong Kong's uneasy relationship with China will constrain -- though not inhibit -- long-term economic growth.
The rest are split roughly between optimists who expect Hong Kong to hum along as before and pessimists who foresee irreparable chaos. 

The interviews took place two years ago.
Since the China crisis erupted, Mr. Mushkat says, the scenario as depicted by the middle-of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties Hong Kong currently faces.
The consensus of this group, which he dubs "realists," is that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between 3% and 5%. 

Such a pace of growth, though respectable for mature industrialized economies, would be unusually slow for Hong Kong.
Only twice since the 1960s has annual gross domestic product growth here fallen below 5% for two or more consecutive years.
The first instance occurred in 1967-68, when China's Cultural Revolution triggered bloody street rioting in the colony.
The other came in 1974-75 from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash.
During the past 10 years, Hong Kong's economic growth has averaged 8.3% annually.
Given Hong Kong's record, Mr. Mushkat's "realists" might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago.
Under the current circumstances, he says, their scenario no longer seems unrealistic. 

"The city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor.
It could lose some of its dynamism," says Mr. Mushkat, a director of Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd., a unit of Britain's Barings PLC. "It doesn't have to be a disaster.
It just means that Hong Kong would become a less exciting place." 

Going by official forecasts of GDP, which measures the colony's output of goods and services, minus foreign income, Mr. Mushkat's "realists" seem relatively close to the mark.
After taking into account the fallout from the China crisis, the government has projected 1989 GDP growth of 5%.
The updated forecast, published Aug. 25, compares with an earlier forecast of 6% published March 1 and a 7.4% rate achieved in 

Sir Piers Jacobs, Hong Kong's financial secretary, says a further downward revision may be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally. "We aren't looking at anything like a doomsday scenario," he says. "But clearly we're entering a difficult period." 

Many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on Hong Kong's economy.
One concerns Japanese investors.
Barely visible on Hong Kong's property scene in 1985, by last year Japan had become the top foreign investor, spending $602 million.
The market has grown relatively quiet since the China crisis.
But if the Japanese return in force, their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors' waning commitment. 

Another -- and critical -- factor is the U.S., Hong Kong's biggest export market.
Even before the China crisis, weak U.S. demand was slowing local economic growth.
Conversely, strong consumer spending in the U.S. two years ago helped propel the local economy at more than twice its current rate. 

Indeed, a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern Hong Kong's economic rhythm.
Once external conditions, such as U.S. demand, swing in the territory's favor, they argue, local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual. 

But economic arguments, however solid, won't necessarily impress Hong Kong's 5.7 million people.
Many are refugees, having fled China's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the Communist Party took power in 1949.
As a result, many of those now planning to leave Hong Kong can't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony's political and economic climate. 

Emigration applications soared in 1985, when Britain and China ratified their accord on Hong Kong's future.
In 1987, Hong Kong's most prosperous year for a decade, 30,000 left, up 58% from the previous year.
Last year, 45,000 went.
The government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next few years at as much as 60,000 -- a projection that is widely regarded as unrealistically low.
A large number of those leaving are managers and professionals.
While no one professes to know the exact cost of such a "brain drain" to the economy, hardly anyone doubts that it poses a threat. 

"When the economy loses a big portion of its work force that also happens to include its most productive members, economic growth is bound to be affected," says Anthong Wong, an economist with Hang Seng Bank. 

Control Data Corp., which just months ago was hemorrhaging financially, thinks it will be healthy enough soon to consider repurchasing public debt. 

Moreover, the company, whose go-it-alone approach nearly proved fatal, now sees alliances with others as the way back to prosperity in what it calls "the data solutions" business. 

"I'm not saying everything is hunky-dory, but we have completed the transition," Robert M. Price, chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. "Transition" is a reference to the company's five-year restructuring effort.
During that time, Control Data had losses of more than $1 billion. 

Now, following asset sales that shrank revenue by more than one-third this year alone, Control Data is flush with cash.
So its senior executives are talking openly about possibly buying back some of the company's $172.5 million in subordinated convertible debentures next year. 

"We'd like to continue to reduce debt," President Lawrence Perlman said.
Noting that the company is offering to buy back $154.2 million in senior notes paying 12 3/4%, he said the response will help determine future debt-reduction efforts.
The offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of Control Data's Imprimis disk-drive business to Seagate Technology Inc. 

Mr. Perlman, who is also acting chief financial officer and the odds-on favorite to become the next chief executive, said the company is achieving "modest positive cash flow from operations, and we expect that to continue into 1990." 

He said the company has no intention of tapping its short-term bank lines "for a good part of 1990." Sometime next year, Control Data will "develop a new bank relationship," Mr. Perlman said.
In recent months a group of lenders, led by Bank of America, has extended Control Data up to $90 million in revolving loans through January, as well as $115 million in standby letters of credit. 

Loan covenants require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling four-quarter profitability test.
Last week Control Data reported third-quarter earnings of $9.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $763 million.
Through the first nine months, the company had a loss of $484 million, largely reflecting the closing of its supercomputer unit. 

While a few assets are still being shopped -- including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the company's Ticketron unit -- Mr. Price said future restructuring would be a question of strategy. "We don't need the cash." 

Ticketron's automated wagering business, which operates lotteries in a half dozen states, is not for sale, the company said.
Rather, Mr. Perlman said, Control Data intends to bid for the coming Minnesota lottery contract and is seeking new applications for the technology overseas, where "there is great interest in games of skill." He wouldn't elaborate. 

Control Data's semiconductor business, VTC Inc., continues to lose money, the executives acknowledged, but they said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant to dispose of it. 

The company's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable -- it recently achieved profitability after several quarters of losses -- calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses.
Partly, costs will be held down through strategic technology alliances, management said.
Control Data recently announced an agreement with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to jointly develop machines with simplified operating software. 

James E. Ousley, computer products group president, said such arrangements could help slash Control Data's computer research and development costs in half by the end of 1990.
He disclosed that before Control Data scrapped its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer business this past spring, those costs were running at nearly 35% of group revenue.
At the same time four of six design projects were spiked, he said. 

Asked how the company hopes to expand its computer hardware business, Mr. Ousley said it sees good opportunities in systems integration. "We think we're getting only 10% of the integration dollars our customers are spending," he said. "We're in environments that are going to spend a lot of money on that." 

Control Data mainframes are designed for numerically intensive computing users, such as the scientific, engineering and academic communities.
Utilities management is a major commercial niche. 

Reviewing the company's scrape with disaster, Mr. Price conceded it had tried to do too much on its own. "Absolutely," he said. 

But while its stock is selling at about half Control Data's estimated breakup value, neither Messrs.
Perlman nor Price said he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover. "We've been listed as a candidate for so long it's not worth worrying about," said Mr. Price. 

McDonnell Douglas Corp. received contracts totaling $244.8 million for 72 F-A-18 aircraft for the Navy and helicopter spare parts for the Army. 

Aerojet General Corp., a unit of GenCorp Inc., was awarded a $40.1 million
Air Force contract for Minuteman missile rocket motors. 

Rockwell International Corp. received a $26.7 million Navy contract for submarine ballistic missiles. 

Honeywell Inc. got a $22.3 million Navy contract for aircraft missile warning sets. 

Beech Aircraft Corp., a unit of Raytheon Co., received an $11.5 million Air Force contract for C-12 aircraft support. 

Aetna Life & Casualty Co. 's third-quarter net income fell 22% to $182.6 million, or $1.63 a share, reflecting the damages from Hurricane Hugo and lower results for some of the company's major divisions. 

Catastrophe losses reduced Aetna's net income by $50 million, including $36 million from Hugo.
Last year catastrophe losses totaled $5 million, when net was $235.5 million, or $2.07 a share.
The year-earlier results have been restated to reflect an accounting change. 

The insurer has started processing claims from the Northern California earthquake nearly two weeks ago.
But because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly, the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Aetna closed at $60, down 50 cents. 

In the latest quarter, Aetna had a $23 million loss on its auto/homeowners line, compared with earnings of $33 million last year.
Profit for its commercial insurance division fell 30% to $59 million, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property/casualty market for nearly three years. 

However, Aetna's employee benefits division, which includes its group health insurance operations, posted a 34% profit gain to $106 million. 

Third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $48 million, which included $27 million from the sale of Federated Investors in August and a $15 million tax credit. 

In the nine months, net rose 4.3% to $525.8 million or $4.67 a share, from $504.2 million, or $4.41 a share, last year. 

Conseco Inc. said it is calling for the redemption on Dec. 7 of all the 800,000 remaining shares outstanding of its $1.875 Series A convertible preferred stock at $26.805 a share. 

The insurance concern said all conversion rights on the stock will terminate on Nov. 30.
Until then, Conseco said the stock remains convertible into common stock at the rate of 1.439 shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $17.50 a common share.
In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Conseco closed at $19.50, down 25 cents. 

Among the things I learned covering the World Series these past few weeks is that the Richter scale, which measures earthquakes, isn't like the one in your bathroom.
A quake that measures two on the Richter isn't twice as severe as a "one" -- it's 10 times worse.
A "three" is 10 times 10 again, and so on.
That put the "seven" of Oct. 17 in perspective for me.
Think I'll buy one of those "I Survived" T-shirts after all. 

By Richterian standards, the show that the Oakland Athletics put on Friday and Saturday nights, in putting a mercifully swift end to the game's Longest Short Series, rated somewhere between a 10 and an 11.
The boys with the white elephants on their sleeves might not have made the earth move much, but they certainly did some impressive things with baseballs. 

The Pale Pachyderms propelled six of 'em out of the unfriendly confines of Candlestick Park during the two games en route to 13-7 and 9-6 wins over the San Francisco Giants.
Combined with their two pre-quake victories, way back on Oct. 14 and 15 (the scores were 5-0 and 5-1, remember?), that gave them a sweep of the best-of-seven series. 

The joke here is that the Giants lost by de fault.
That's geologically correct, but a trifle unfair otherwise.
They showed up, but didn't -- or couldn't -- challenge. 

They led for nary an inning in the four games, and managed to stir their fans only once.
That came in the seventh inning of Game Four when, trailing 8-2, they scored four times and brought their big heat -- Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell -- to the plate with one out and a runner on.
But Clark flied out to short right field and Mitchell's drive to left was caught on the warning track by Rickey Henderson as 62,000 sets of lungs exhaled as one. 

"I went out to Todd {Burns, the A's reliever} and told him that we weren't gonna let this guy beat us," said Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach of the decisive confrontation with Mitchell, the National League's reigning home-run king. "I told him to make Mitchell reach for everything, and that's what we did.
The ball he hit wasn't a strike.
If it had been, he mighta hit it out." 

But if the A's hadn't won in four, they would have prevailed in five, or six, or seven.
The best team won this Series, which is more unusual than it may sound.
Baseball ain't football, where the good teams beat up on the bad ones.
The best baseball teams win six of 10 games and the worst win four of 10.
Without becoming overly contentious, allow me to suggest that several recent champions of the world according to us (as in U.S.) might not have ranked No. 1 in many polls.
That list includes last season's champs, the Los Angeles Dodgers, who rode a miracle home run by Kirk Gibson and two faultless pitching performances by Orel Hershiser to a five-game triumph over a bewitched, bothered Oakland crew. 

These A's, however, got few grades as low as B on their 1989 report card.
They led the Major Leagues in regular-season wins with 99 and flattened the Toronto Blue Jays four games to one for the American League pennant before stomping their cross-bay rivals.
The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from Giants' manager Roger Craig after his team had fallen in Game Three to a five-home-run barrage that tied a 61-year-old Series record.
Asked what he would do differently on the morrow, Craig allowed that he might play his outfielders deeper, "maybe on the other side of the fence." 

The A's offensive showing in the Series got an A, as in awesome.
Their 85 total bases broke a record for a four-game set, and their nine home runs tied one.
Eight Oakland players hit homers, with centerfielder Dave Henderson getting two, both on Friday.
Rickey Henderson, the do-everything leadoff man, had nine hits and set or tied four-game Series marks for triples (2) and stolen bases (3). 

The sole A not to homer was cleanup hitter Mark McGwire, their regular-season leader with 33, and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in Game Three that stopped a Giant rally while the issue still was in doubt. "Think I'll redo my image -- get this changed to a glove," quipped the big first baseman Saturday night, fingering the gold bat he wears on a neck chain. 

Even with that power show, though, the Oakland Series' star, certified by the Most Valuable Player award, was a pitcher, Dave Stewart.
He shut out the Giants on five hits in Game One, and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake. 

Stewart's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds.
One was that, despite his 62 regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the Land Beyond the Late News, he has been overshadowed by his more-muscular mates and missed out on prizes that might have been his due.
The other is that he's an Oakland native, and lifted residents' spirits by his visits to quake-hit areas last week. 

Afterward, as the A's toasted their victory with beer (they dispensed with traditional champagne showers in deference to the quake victims), Stewart said he thought his championship-team ring would outshine his individual trophy. "Give me four or five more Series with these guys, and I don't care if I ever win a Cy Young," he said, in reference to baseball's best-pitcher award. 

Indeed, the possibility of an A's ring cycle, a/k/a a dynasty, was a major topic of post-game discussion Saturday, so much so that Sandy Alderson, the team's general manager, felt obliged to dampen it. "People change, teams change," he cautioned. "It's easier to get worse than better in this game." 

He might have added an interesting historical fact: The last Series sweep, by the Cincinnati Reds, came in 1976, which also was the first year of baseball player free agency.
It was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous, "big market" teams to monopolize the best talent, but quite the opposite has occurred: Twelve different clubs have won titles in the 14 seasons since its advent.
The number includes such unstylish burgs as, well, Oakland. 

In the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year, Boeing Co. said it will create a Defense and Space Group to consolidate several divisions. 

Meanwhile, Boeing officials and representatives of the Machinists union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt to break the month-old strike that has shut the aerospace giant's assembly lines at a time when it has an $80 billion backlog of jetliner orders.
The two sides were scheduled to meet with the mediator this morning. 

Machinists already have rejected a package that would provide a 10% pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract.
Boeing has said repeatedly it won't expand its offer and the machinists have responded that the offer isn't good enough. 

However, the resolve of some of the striking 57,000 machinists might be weakening.
About 1,000 strikers signed petitions last week calling for Boeing and Machinists representatives to schedule new meetings.
The two sides hadn't met since Oct. 18. 

While Boeing's commercial business is booming, its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the Reagan presidency.
In May, the company consolidated its Aerospace and Electronics groups; the new Defense and Space Group will contain the Aerospace and Electronics division and Advanced Systems, both based in the Seattle area; Boeing Helicopters in Philadelphia; Boeing Military Airplanes in Wichita, Kan., and ArgoSystems in Sunnyvale, Calif. 

B. Dan Pinick, president of Boeing Aerospace and Electronics, will become president of the new group, which will become operational Jan. 2. 

In addition, Boeing said it also will reorganize all its work in Wichita into military and commercial divisions.
All of the changes will reduce its overhead and streamline operations, Boeing said. 

Analysts agreed. "It's a further step to better returns in the hemorrhaging defense business," said Steven Binder, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. in New York. "They had to do it." 

Howard Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York, said the shift reflects Boeing confidence in Mr. Pinick, described by Mr. Rubel as an expert on doing business with the military. "His side of the business has been successful in a tough environment," Mr. Rubel said. 

Broad Inc. said it doubled its regular quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 2.5 cents on common, and to 4.5 cents a share 2.25 cents on Class B stock, payable Nov. 10 to holders of record Nov. 6. 

The financial services company emerged from the restructuring of Kaufman & Broad, Inc., which spun off its home-building subsidiary into Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. earlier this year and changed its name to Broad Inc. 

For the 10-month fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Chairman Eli Broad said he expected earnings results to approximate analysts' estimates, which the company said have been revised upward to 80 cents a share.
This would compare with an estimated loss of 3 cents a share for the comparable 10 months last year, which included restructuring costs. 

Automatic Data Processing Inc. plans to redeem on Nov. 16 its $150 million of 6.5% convertible subordinated debentures due March 1, 2011. 

The computing-services concern will pay $1,059.04 for each $1,000 face amount of debt.
The conversion price for the debentures is $41.725 a share.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Automatic Data closed at $46.50 a share, down $2.25. 

If all the debt is converted to common, Automatic Data will issue about 3.6 million shares; last Monday, the company had nearly 73 million shares outstanding. 

Automatic Data is redeeming the bonds because the after-tax cost of the interest on the bonds is higher than the dividend yield on the common, a spokesman said. 

If a TV weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast, Donald H. Straszheim surely understands.
The chief economist of Merrill Lynch & Co. finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the Midwest on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction. 

Mr. Straszheim expects he will take some heat, and he's right.
Since the last time he traveled this way several months ago, he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession.
In February 1988, for example, Merrill Lynch's weekly commentary announced that "the economy is likely to fall into recession in early 1989." 

The forecasts were widely disseminated, and, in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds.
It said long-term interest rates, then above 9%, could drop to 7% by the end of 1989, so bonds, which benefit from falling rates, would be a good buy.
The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40% to 45% and later to 55%. 

But this September -- just when many market economists, including some at Merrill Lynch, believed that Mr. Straszheim was about to be proved right -- he took a detour if not a U-turn.
He softened the talk about a recession.
Now, in fact, he is predicting economic growth of 2.9% this year and 2.1% next year, a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter. 

And, just recently, Merrill Lynch cut the recommended bondholdings back to 50%.
While such changes might sound minor, they aren't: Merrill Lynch manages or oversees some $300 billion in retail accounts that include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities. 

Two well-known colleagues who believe Mr. Straszheim was right the first time are David Bostian Jr. and A. Gary Shilling, both of whom run their own New York research firms.
Mr. Bostian said in August that his macroeconomic index signaled recession.
Mr. Shilling, who was Merrill Lynch's chief economist from 1967 to 1971, has heralded a recession for months. "My own personal opinion is that Don threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet," he says. 

Now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy.
And Mr. Straszheim conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that "it may prove to be the case that we got whipsawed -- that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time." He adds, "That's the forecasting business." 

However risky the business, it's brisk these days.
Pestered by bosses, brokers, clients and media people and pushed by their own egos, Wall Street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator.
But the surprisingly durable seven-year economic expansion has made mincemeat of more than one forecast. 

This isn't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities.
This is the commercial version. 

Carrying the new message on the road, Mr. Straszheim meets confrontation that often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the client.
No sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time.
Some smaller clients don't seem to notice his switch.
But with some clients, the talk can heat up a bit. 

Dennis O'Brien, the treasurer of Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago, adopts a polite approach, waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast.
A good half-hour into breakfast at the Palmer House, Mr. O'Brien looks up from his plate after Mr. Straszheim says something about people who believe interest rates are about to nosedive. "I'm one of them who hope they will, with $6 billion in debt on the books.
Is that the forecast?" Mr. O'Brien asks, trying to pin down the economist.
He doesn't fully succeed, although Mr. Straszheim lists an array of interest-rate scenarios. 

In a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital Management in Minneapolis, in contrast, the firm's money managers seem ready to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall.
Alfred Harrison, the manager, shoves Mr. Straszheim's handout back at him: "Do we want to go through this?
Or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it's about to be right?" 

Swiveling in his chair, Mr. Straszheim replies that the new outlook, though still weak, doesn't justify calling a recession right now. "It's all in this handout you don't want to look at.
We could still have a recession" at some point.
One of Mr. Straszheim's recurring themes is that the state of the economy isn't a simple black or white.
Sometimes, like now, it's gray. 

This somewhat-ambiguous assessment moves one Alliance portfolio manager to ask: "So, what is this -- a Stealth recession?" Another challenges Merrill Lynch's bond recommendation last year. "We're not running that ad campaign any more," Mr. Straszheim snaps in a rare show of irritation.
He adds, "I think it was a fairly decent call." 

Explaining his change of mind, Mr. Straszheim says later, "It's hard to pin this on one factor." He says the economy, and especially the employment numbers, look much better than he expected; interest rates have generally declined; inflation hasn't run amok. "Our business is constantly looking at all these things," he says.
His new forecast calls for "a soft landing." And it may be right, judging from last week's report that inflation-adjusted gross national product rose at a 2.5% annual rate in the third quarter. 

Mr. Shilling understands Mr. Straszheim's problems. "There's unbelievable pressure on economists to forecast these numbers," he says. "You make a forecast, and then you become its prisoner." 

It is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast, and Mr. Straszheim is fidgeting with the handcuffs on this trip.
His approach to the recantation is direct but low-key. "For some time, we had forecast negative third- and fourth-quarter growth.
We pulled that forecast," he begins matter-of-factly in a meeting with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. officials in Minneapolis, the first stop. 

Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted. 

The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate.

R.H. Macy & Co., the closely held department store chain, said in a financial filing Friday that its sales for the fiscal fourth quarter ended July 29 were up 10% to $1.59 billion against $1.44 billion a year earlier. 

Comparable store sales for the quarter were up 7.3%. 

The net loss for the quarter was $43.1 million against a year-earlier loss of $106 million.
The loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for Federated Department Stores Inc., as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations. 

For the year, sales were up 5.6% to $6.97 billion compared with $6.61 billion in fiscal 1988.
Sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of I. Magnin, Bullock's, and Bullocks Wilshire.
Macy acquired those three businesses in May 1988.
On a comparable store basis, including the new acquisitions for both years, sales for fiscal 1989 were up 1.9%. 

Macy reported a net loss for fiscal 1989 of $53.7 million compared with a net loss of $188.2 million for fiscal 1988. 

The company's earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, which bondholders use a measurement of the chain's ability to pay its existing debt, increased 11% in fiscal 1989 to $926.1 million from $833.6 million.
The $833.6 million figures includes the new acquisitions.
Excluding those businesses, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for 1988 would have been $728.5 million. 

As of Feb. 1, 1990, the Bullocks Wilshire stores will operate as I. Magnin stores.
Altogether, Macy and its subsidiaries own or lease 149 department stores and 61 specialty stores nationwide. 

Although management led a leveraged buy-out of R.H. Macy in July 1986, the company still makes financial filings because of its publicly traded debt.
The company estimates its total debt at about $5.2 billion.
This includes $4.6 billion of long-term debt, $457.5 million in short-term debt, and $95.7 million of the current portion of long-term debt. 

In a letter to investors, Chairman Edward S. Finkelstein wrote that he expects the company to "benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors.
While our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes, we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers need and want." 

Mr. Finkelstein is apparently referring to B. Altman and Bonwit Teller, two New York retailers that have recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled Campeau Corp.
Those chains include Bloomingdale's, which Campeau recently said it will sell.
Other retail properties for sale include Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field, retailers now owned by B.A.T PLC, the British tobacco conglomerate. 

In his letter, Mr. Finkelstein also referred to the recent San Francisco earthquake.
Mr. Finkelstein flew to San Francisco the day after the earthquake, and found that 10 to 12 of his company's stores had sustained some damage, including the breakage of most windows at the I. Magnin store on Union Square. 

"The volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive, but looking at the whole fiscal year, we don't see the effect as material," wrote Mr. Finkelstein. 

There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the White House and Congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad. 

After years of mistrust born of Watergate, past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Iran-Contra scandal, President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now, at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities.
If that attitude lasts, it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that hasn't been seen in years. 

Over the past week, the president has agreed to keep the committee informed, usually in advance, of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing.
That wasn't always the way the Reagan administration handled such matters. 

Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so.
Congress never fully trusted former CIA chief William Casey and National Security Adviser John Poindexter to honor the ban. 

Despite objections by the CIA, Mr. Bush also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the CIA who would be independent of the CIA director. 

In return, the Senate panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity.
It also has removed a ban on CIA use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the CIA didn't get back in the assassination game. 

"We've finally been able to convince them that Casey and {Oliver} North don't work here anymore," says one administration official. 

The new understanding didn't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light.
It emerged after a rancorous display of old-style intelligence politics that followed this month's failed coup attempt in Panama. 

The White House used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult.
Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life.
The president also hinted he might veto this year's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive. 

Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.) and Vice Chairman William Cohen (R., Maine), for their part, angrily accused the White House of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to Congress for the bungled attempt to topple Gen. Noriega. 

The White House got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative Republicans who don't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities.
Instead, Mr. Bush and his aides made it clear they respected Congress's role and felt they could work with the conservative Mr. Boren and the moderate Mr. Cohen to iron out their differences. 

The senators responded in kind.
Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been "a meeting of the minds" with the White House, and that the committee had given Mr. Bush "a clean slate," free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years.
Sen. Cohen said the relationship has reverted to its pre-Reagan character. 

There still are some details to be nailed down.
Mr. Bush is reserving the right in "rare" instances to keep Congress in the dark, asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee doesn't recognize.
And a pending Justice Department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled. 

Moreover, both sides may face political critics.
Some conservatives will accuse the president of promising Congress too much.
And they continue anonymously attacking CIA Director William Webster for being too accommodating to the committee.
At the same time, some congressional liberals will accuse Sens.
Boren and Cohen of wimping out, and they will warn that the lawmakers' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the Iran arms sales. 

But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities, the country could be entering an era when such hare-brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards, while risky but well-planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky Congress will balk. 

Charles A. Pearce, 66 years old, will retire from his post as chief executive officer of this bank holding company effective Dec. 31.
He will remain chairman.
Charles R. Simpson Jr., 46, president and chief operating officer, will assume the chief executive's post. 

American Airlines will expand its trans-Atlantic service 30% beginning next year with six new daily flights between the U.S. and Europe, officials announced yesterday. 

American, a unit of AMR Corp., is the nation's largest airline. 

The new nonstop flights, starting next May, will include Chicago-Warsaw, Chicago-Helsinki, Miami-Madrid, Dallas-Barcelona, a second daily Chicago-Paris flight and a second daily Chicago-Manchester flight, the officials said. 

Chicago has the largest population of citizens of Polish heritage in any city outside Poland. 

With the new service, American will fly 161 flights a week to 17 European cities.
The additions solidify American's position as the third-largest U.S. transatlantic carrier, behind PanAm Corp. 's Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines. 

Bio-Technology General Corp. received tenders for 97.9% of its 7.5% convertible senior subordinated notes due April 15, 1997, and 96% of its 11% convertible senior subordinated debentures due March 1, 2006. 

In exchange offers that expired Friday, holders of each $1,000 of notes will receive $250 face amount of Series A 7.5% senior secured convertible notes due Jan. 15, 1995, and 200 common shares.
For each $1,000 face amount of debentures, holders received $250 of Series B 11% senior secured convertible notes due Oct. 15, 1998, and 200 common shares. 

Bio-Technology, a New York maker of genetically engineered products for human and animal health care, said it made the exchange offer to reduce its interest payments. 

Weisfield's Inc. said it is in preliminary discussions regarding the possible sale of the company. 

A spokesman for the retail jeweler said the company would provide more details today and that it expects to reach a definitive agreement by the end of the week. 

In over-the-counter trading Friday, Weisfield's gained $9.50 to $39.
At that price, the company has an indicated value of $42.9 million.
Weisfield's had about 1.1 million shares outstanding as of July 31. 

The stock gained $2.75 Thursday to close at a then-52 week high. 

Lawrence M. Gressette Jr., president, was elected to the additional posts of chairman and chief executive officer of this utility holding company, effective Feb. 1, 1990.
The 57-year-old Mr. Gressette, who was also elected chairman and chief executive of all Scana subsidiaries, succeeds John A. Warren.
Mr. Warren will remain on the company's board. 

London share prices closed sharply lower Friday in active trading after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's resignation slapped the market and Wall Street's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down. 

London shares were depressed initially by overnight losses in New York and by the drop in sterling after Mr. Lawson's resignation.
It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling, but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading, and signs of further weakness in the British pound, proved a hefty load to bear.
New York stocks recovered some of their losses after the London market closed. 

The Financial Times 100-share index shed 47.3 points to close at 2082.1, down 4.5% from the previous Friday and 6.8% from Oct. 13, when Wall Street's plunge helped spark the current weakness in London. 

The 30-share index settled 42.0 points lower at 1678.5.
Volume was 840.8 million shares, up from 443.6 million Thursday and the week's most active session. 

Dealers said the turnover, largely confined to the 100-share index stocks, partly reflected the flurry of activity typical at the close of a two-week trading account and the start of a new account.
But they said Friday's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed active overseas selling and showed the broad-based fears over the status of the U.K. economy and Britain's currency in the wake of the upheaval in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. 

A senior dealer with Warburg Securities noted British Gas, the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded, was affected by the political implications of Mr. Lawson's departure and Mrs. Thatcher's cabinet shuffle. 

He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be in turmoil and Britain's Labor Party positioned to regain control of the government and renew efforts at nationalization. 

British Gas shed 8.5 pence a share to close at 185 pence ($2.90). 

Other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that London shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. Lawson's successor, John Major, had only been in the job one day. 

Besides British Gas, British Steel skidded 1.74 to 123.5 on turnover of 11 million shares. 

British Petroleum fell 5 to 286 on 14 million shares traded.
Dealers said the multinational oil company was pressured by recent brokerage recommendations urging investors to switch into Shell Trading & Transport.
Shell eased 1 to 416 on turnover of 4.8 million shares. 

Among the other actively traded blue-chip issues, Imperial Chemical Industries dropped 11 to #10.86, Hanson skidded 9.5 to 200.5, and British Telecom fell 10 to 250. 

In Tokyo, stocks closed lower but above intraday lows in active trading.
The Nikkei index was pressured down by profit-taking triggered by sharp advances made through this week and fell 151.20 points to 35527.29. 

In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index fell 148.85 points to 35378.44. 

On Friday, the Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 15.82 at 2681.76.
First-section volume was estimated at 1.3 billion shares, up from 886 million shares Thursday. 

An official at Wako Securities said brokerages' excessive expectations about recent advances in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were dashed Friday. 

Dealers placed heavy buy orders in the morning to start the first trading day for November transactions.
But they failed to sell these stocks to client investors, who were cautious about the sharp gains these issues made this week, the Wako official said. 

Fund managers said Friday's profittaking was a natural result of the week's "abnormal fever" in buying real estate, shipbuilding, steel and construction shares. 

Frankfurt prices closed lower again Friday, the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the DAX index lose 4%.
The DAX dropped 19.69 points Friday to 1462.93. 

Traders said the continued turbulence in other markets, coupled with the drop in London following the Lawson resignation, were responsible. 

Traders said that selling pressure wasn't enormous and that the DAX dropped Friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest.
They said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square positions ahead of the weekend. 

"It's the whole uncertainty about what's happening around us," said Valentin Von Korff, a trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in Frankfurt. "If you take away the outside influences, the market itself looks very cheap.
What's happening here isn't justified by the fundamentals." 

Traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the New York Stock Exchange last week.
That's leaving small investors with cold feet, they said, and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well, at least until the market in New York settles down somewhat. 

Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Brussels and Stockholm, and were mixed in Milan.
The British shakeup was widely cited for the declines. 

Share prices also closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Seoul.
Concern about declines in other markets, especially New York, caused selling pressure.

The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission: 

ECI Environmental Inc., initial offering of 1.1 million shares, of which ECI will sell 990,000 and co-founders will sell 110,000 shares, via Oppenheimer & Co. 

Fastenal Co., proposed offering of 400,000 common shares by holders, via Robert W. Baird & Co. and William Blair & Co. 

First Capital Holdings Corp., proposed offering of $275 million of floating rate senior notes, via Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 

Industrial Funding Corp., initial offering of common stock, via Alex.
Brown & Sons Inc. and Piper Jaffray & Hopwood. 

Parametric Technology Corp., initial offering of 1.7 million common shares, of which 1,365,226 shares will be sold by the company and 334,774 shares by holders, via Alex Brown & Sons, Hambrecht & Quist and Wessels, Arnold & Henderson. 

Union Camp Corp., shelf offering of up to $250 million of debt securities. 

Humana Inc. said it expects to receive about $27 million in federal income-tax refunds and interest from a court ruling on a tax dispute. 

The health-care company said it expects the refund to be included in the first quarter ending Nov. 30.
The refund is about $9 million.
Accrued interest on the refund was about $18 million as of Oct. 25. 

The refund stems from a court ruling that found certain payments by Humana subsidiaries to its insurance subsidiary during fiscal 1977 through 1979 were deductible as premiums for liability insurance. 

Dow Chemical Co. said third-quarter net income slipped 6.8% from a record year-ago quarter.
The decline broke a streak of 10 quarters in which Dow posted earnings increases. 

Dow's third-quarter net fell to $589 million, or $3.29 a share, from $632 million, or $3.36 a share, a year ago.
Sales in the latest quarter rose 2% to $4.25 billion from $4.15 billion a year earlier. 

Dow closed at $94.625 a share, up 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

A spokeswoman said Dow is comfortable with Wall Street expectations that full-year earnings will total about $14.60 a share, compared with last year's record net of $2.4 billion, or $12.76 a share.
But that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether Dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $3.44 a share, or $635 million.
Dow would earn $14.85 a share for the year if it equaled that year-ago fourth-quarter performance. 

Dow officials were signaling that the company would earn less than $15 a share this year even before they announced in July a plan to acquire 67% of Marion Laboratories Inc.
That acquisition could further dilute earnings per share this year, the company spokeswoman said.
Dow hasn't said exactly what impact the Marion acquisition will have on 1989 earnings. 

Dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors, including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals, a slower U.S. economy and a stronger dollar, which made Dow's exports from the U.S. more expensive to overseas customers.
Another problem was a 7% increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only 2%. 

For the first nine months of the year, Dow earned $2.06 billion, or $11.41 a share, up 17% from $1.76 billion, or $9.32 a share, a year ago.
Sales for the latest nine months rose 7.7% to $13.34 billion from $12.38 billion in the year-ago period. 

Steven C. Walker, senior vice president of this bank holding company, was named president, chief executive officer and a director of both Commercial National and Commercial National Bank.
He succeeds James E. Burt III, who resigned from all three posts to pursue other interests. 

TRADING VOLUME in Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday totaled 73,803 contracts.

Consolidated Papers Inc. said it plans to spend $495 million on new paper-manufacturing equipment and facilities. 

The producer of paper used in magazines and by commercial printers said spending on the expansion is planned to begin in the first quarter of 1990.
The expansion is subject to approval by federal and Wisconsin environmental regulators. 

Ethyl Corp. reported that third-quarter net income fell 12% from a year-earlier quarter helped by a gain from discontinued operations.
Profit from continuing operations rose 19%. 

The chemicals and insurance company said net in the latest quarter was $54.8 million, or 45 cents a share.
In the year-earlier quarter, net was $62.2 million, or 51 cents a share.
The previous-year quarter included $16.1 million from businesses spun off as Tredegar Industries Inc. 

Revenue was $613.7 million, up 18% from $521.2 million a year ago. 

Ethyl said pretax profit from its insurance segment, excluding investment gains, rose 28% in the latest quarter to $28.6 million from $22.4 million.
In the chemicals segment, pretax profit rose 7% to $69.2 million from $64.9 million.
The company's chemicals interests include, among other things, petroleum additives, pharmaceuticals ingredients and polysilicon used by the semiconductor industry. 

For the nine months, Ethyl said net fell 2% to $168.7 million, or $1.40 a share, from $172.2 million, $1.42 a share, a year ago. 

Net in the latest period included $11.9 million from discontinued operations and a charge of $6.2 million from a plant closing.
In the year-ago period, net included $32.7 million from discontinued operations. 

Revenue was $1.79 billion, up 18% from $1.52 billion a year earlier. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Ethyl closed at $25.875 a share, up 12.5 cents. 

Enserch Corp. said about 12 million, or 93%, of the publicly traded units of its limited partnership, Enserch Exploration Partners Ltd., were tendered in response to an offer that expired Monday. 

Enserch said the tendered units will raise its ownership of the partnership to more than 99% from 87%.
About 900,000 units will continue to be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Enserch said.
Enserch had offered one-half a share of its common and $1 in cash for each unit. 

Whether or not "great cases make bad-law" -- as Justice Holmes asserted -- who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the nominee's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history? 

Ethan Bronner's "Battle for Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America" (Norton, 399 pages, $22.50) is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings, done with journalistic verve, but with a flawed legal philosophy.
While the book amply justifies its subtitle, the title itself is dubious.
What shook America was not a battle for justice but for naked power, in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had demonized. 

In its basic structure and style the book is novelistic, with piquant character portrayal, hard-wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely to be encountered in a Washington docudrama than in a constitutional history. 

Mr. Bronner seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way.
I doubt that.
Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments, the contingency plans in place, and Mr. Bork's paper trail of vulnerable writings, it was pretty clear that Judge Bork never stood much chance of being confirmed.
As Mr. Bronner himself says, the smell of "raw meat" was in the air. 

Perhaps because they won, Mr. Bork's attackers come through more vividly than his defenders.
Ralph Neas was the organizing genius, whipping a conglomerate of pressure groups into an irresistible attacking force.
Harvard's Laurence Tribe was the constitutional heavy, laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow.
But it was Ted Kennedy who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of "Robert Bork's America" -- the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically, he claimed, from the positions Mr. Bork had taken over the space of two decades.
Sen. Kennedy, never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground, emoted brilliantly. 

I add two others.
Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed at showing that Mr. Bork was willing to stretch the Constitution in one area (free speech) while remaining rigid in all the others.
It achieved a good media play, and enabled Sen. Specter and others to vote against Mr. Bork out of "conscience." Further ammunition came from left legal theorist Ronald Dworkin, who in the New York Review of Books painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the Constitution, particularly in the area of "original intent." The charge of being "outside the mainstream" of legal thought gravely undercut Mr. Bork's scholarly standing, leaving him bleeding on the platform. 

The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of Democratic moderates in the South and Southwest had broken party lines.
But Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin to punish them in their next Senate elections.
Demographics converged with "mainstream" and demonizing to seal Robert Bork's fate. 

The upshot?
Mr. Bork's opponents chose the battlefield, held it and kept it.
Yet with the smooth confirmation of Anthony Kennedy, an "80 percenter" only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. Bork, the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war. 

Another upshot, however, was the chilling message the Bork hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the Supreme Court draws its talent.
The word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey, with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen. 

Unfortunately, the author simply doesn't supply the philosophical frame to sustain his reportorial talents.
He has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture.
Probing more deeply into the doctrine of "judicial restraint," he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of Justice Holmes.
He would discover it also in Alexander Bickel, a subtle constitutional scholar, Mr. Bork's closest friend at Yale, whose influence on the judge goes well beyond Mr. Bronner's reporting. 

Still, the long view of Robert Bork as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one.
His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine, which keeps the Court clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives.
Unfortunately, Mr. Bork failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere. 

The question of segregated schools, in Brown vs.
Board of Education, was such an issue.
In our time abortion has become another, best left to a line of Supreme Court decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures.
A reflective and growing consensus of Americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters (decided in the Griswold case) to abortion as well.
One can understand Mr. Bork's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched, though a Supreme Court composed of men and women with realism, guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it.
What is certain is that if Americans allow another happening like the degrading Bork confirmation circus, it will be at their peril.

Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission Wednesday cleared Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s purchase of a specialty bulk-chemical unit from Monsanto Co., saying the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on U.K. industrial consumers. 

The commission, which was asked to study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February, said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant U.K. market share Rhone-Poulenc would gain through the acquisition. 

The French chemical giant would hold an 80% share of the U.K. market for salicylic acid, methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin. 

The commission found that if the British government attempted to block the merger, Rhone-Poulenc would likely respond by closing the salicylates plant Monsanto operates in Wales, removing the matter from U.K. jurisdiction. 

South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, brushing aside suggestions that the won be revalued again, said the currency's current level against the dollar is "appropriate." 

His comments, made in response to reporters' questions at the National Press Club here, signaled that Seoul is resisting U.S. pressure for a further rise in the currency's value.
The U.S. wants a higher won to make South Korea's exports more expensive and help trim Seoul's trade surplus.
Many South Korean business people want a devaluation instead, arguing that the won's recent gains already have weakened the country's export performance. 

Mr. Roh also said South Korea is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces.
Seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won's value remains heavily controlled. 

Mr. Roh said a U.S. demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved "satisfactorily" but gave no hint when that will happen.
Speaking to a joint meeting of Congress earlier, he said South Korea can't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues "without causing political and social trauma."

Leveraged buy-outs may be curbed by two rules in pending congressional legislation.
The provisions, in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate, could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10% and cool the takeover boom.

Morrison Knudsen Corp. posted third-quarter net income of $7.9 million, or 69 cents a share, continuing a rebound from steep year-ago losses. 

In the third quarter a year-earlier, the construction and engineering concern posted a loss of $51.2 million, or $4.68 a share. 

Revenue in the latest quarter rose 14% to $589 million from $515.1 million. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Morrison gained $2.25 to $44.125. 

Morrison said the engineering and construction segment performed well, with the mining and MK-Ferguson operations making important contributions. 

Boise, Idaho-based Morrison had losses totaling $186 million over the two years ended in December, but it has surged back to profitability as a result of cost-cutting and shedding of unprofitable operations. 

In the nine months, the company's net income was $21.5 million, or $1.88 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $97.8 million, or $8.96 a share.
Revenue rose 17% to $1.62 billion from $1.39 billion. 

Fleet/Norstar Financial Group reported a 12% increase in net income in the third quarter, led by a 43% gain in its financial services group.
Fleet's net was $96.4 million, or 86 cents a primary share, compared with $85.8 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. 

The Providence, R.I., financial services group, which includes commercial-credit, leasing and mortgage-banking operations, contributed $30.6 million to net, up from last year's $21.3 million.
Fleet also noted that, unlike other banking companies in the Northeast, it has been only marginally hurt by nonperforming loans that have resulted from the slumping regional real estate market. 

Fleet reported nine-month net of $279.0 million, or $2.51 a primary share, up from $248.2 million, or $2.28 a share, a year earlier. 

Federal prosecutors said they have obtained a guilty plea from another person in the government's ongoing probe of illegal payments in the record industry. 

William Craig, an independent record promoter, pleaded guilty to payola and criminal tax charges, according to a statement issued by Gary Feess, the U.S. attorney here.
Payola is the practice of making illegal, undisclosed payments to radio station personnel in return for getting the stations to play certain songs over the air. 

As part of his plea agreement with the government, the 44-year-old Mr. Craig faces a maximum of three years in prison.
In return, Mr. Craig agreed to cooperate in the government's continuing payola probe, says a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office. 

Mr. Craig and three others were indicted last year as part of that payola probe.
Two other defendants previously pleaded guilty, and charges against the third were dropped. 

Zurn Industries Inc. said it received approval to proceed on four separate projects with a total contract value of $59 million. 

The projects include construction of a 29,400 kilowatt waste-to-energy plant for Ada Cogeneration L.P., Ada, Mich.; a steam generating plant at Ontario, Calif., that Zurn will own and operate, and two waste-water control projects in Orange County, Calif. 

French crude-steel production in September was 1,616,000 metric tons, unchanged from a year earlier, according to the National Steel Manufacturers' Association. 

The association said the September total brought French output for the first nine months this year to 14,789,000 tons, up 4.5% from a year earlier. 

U.S. steel imports in August fell 14% from a year earlier to 1,531,000 tons, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. 

The trade group's compilation of Commerce Department data showed that August imports, the second largest monthly total of the year, were up 5% from July's 1,458,000 tons but below last year's high of 1,979,000 tons in June 1988. 

August imports claimed 18.5% of the U.S. market, compared with 19.3% in July and 20.5% in August 1988.
The latest month's figures show that imports of steel from European Community nations fell to 466,000 tons from 481,000 a month earlier, while imports from Japan rose to 323,000 tons from 288,000 in July.
Imports from Canada rose to 272,000 tons in August from 209,000 in July. 

The American Institute for Imported Steel said imports for the first eight months of 1989 were below the level allowed by the Voluntary Restraint Agreement program.
The institute said that, excluding semifinished steel products, year-to-date imports represented 15.2% of consumption, compared with a permitted maximum of 18.5%. 

Donald J. Amaral, 37 years old, was named president and chief operating officer of this owner and operator of hospitals, nursing centers and retirement hotels.
He succeeds as president, Don Freeberg, who remains chairman and chief executive officer.
The position of chief operating officer is new. 

Prospect Group Inc., whose recent hostile tender offer for Recognition Equipment Inc. failed for lack of financing, apparently has gained a measure of control over the troubled company anyway. 

As part of what a Recognition spokeswoman termed an "amiable agreement," Prospect Group will wind up with control of top management posts and an increased stake in the maker of data management equipment. 

In a management restructuring, Thomas L. Ringer resigned as chairman, chief executive and a director, while Israel Sheinberg resigned as a director.
Mr. Sheinberg remains as executive vice president.
Thomas M. Hurley and Robert A. Vanourek, who had been designated to take over Recognition's top spots had Prospect's tender offer succeeded, were named co-chief executives and directors.
Mr. Hurley was formerly a vice president and general manager of an Avery International division; Mr. Vanourek was a former group vice president of Pitney Bowes Inc. 

In addition, the agreement calls for Gilbert H. Lamphere, chairman of Prospect Group's executive committee, to be named chairman of a restructured board that will include four new independent directors.
Also named to the revised board was Thomas A. Loose, Recognition's senior vice president and general counsel. 

Prospect, a New York-based leveraged buy-out firm, also agreed to invest $15 million in Recognition, which in turn agreed to repurchase as much as $20 million of its stock.
That would increase Prospect's ownership of the company's fully-diluted shares outstanding to 20% from 14.1%.
Under the agreement, Prospect is permitted to increase its stake in Recognition to 30%.
Beyond that, Prospect said it wouldn't offer to acquire additional shares for less than $11.25 a share during the next year or less than $14.06 a share during the subsequent two years. 

Recognition also said it obtained a commitment from Chemical Bank and Bank of Boston to convert an estimated $18 million in bank debt to a new, 24-month secured term loan to be repaid through the sale of certain assets. 

In August, Recognition said it was in violation of certain terms of its debt agreements with bank lenders because of a $3.9 million loss for the third quarter ended July 31.
The company attributed the loss to declining revenue and litigation costs relating to criminal charges against the company and two former executives, William G. Moore Jr. and Robert W. Reedy.
The former executives were indicted last October on charges of fraud, theft and conspiracy related to efforts by the company to win $400 million in Postal Service contracts. 

Recognition Equipment said it expected to put the agreement with Prospect to a vote of its stockholders at a special meeting in January. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Recognition rose 87.5 cents to $6.625.
Prospect slipped 25 cents to $10.50 in national over-the-counter trading. 

Loral Corp. said it received a $325 million order from Turkey's Ministry of Defense, the largest contract the company ever has received. 

Loral will provide to Turkey an electronic countermeasures system for its fleet of F-16 aircraft.
The system provides radar-threat warning and electronic jamming capabilities. 

The defense electronics maker said delivery will begin in October 1991 and run through mid-1995.
Loral said the contract with Turkey will provide opportunities for Loral to supply that country with other defense systems. 

General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division, reacting to slow sales, said it will offer $800 rebates on its 1990 Beretta, the two-door version of its core compact-car line. 

Sluggish sales of the Beretta, and its four-door sister car, the Corsica, prompted GM to idle the two plants that build the automobiles for a total of three weeks this month.
The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet, but sales of the vehicles are off 9.6% for the year, and fell a steep 34% during early October. 

Chevrolet already is offering an $800 rebate on the 1990-model Corsica.
The latest rebate is good for all Beretta models.
Chevrolet buyers can take the rebate, or get discount financing at rates ranging from 6.9% on 24-month loans to 10.9% on 60-month loans. 

The House Ethics Committee officially cited Rep. Jim Bates (D., Calif.) for sexually harassing two female employees, but didn't recommend formal disciplinary action. 

Rep. Bates said he accepted the finding, but one of the victims, Dorena Bertussi, denounced the ethics panel's action as "absurd." 

Acting more than a year after Ms. Bertussi filed a complaint, the panel issued a "letter of reproval" saying Rep. Bates had admitted conduct that violated a House rule forbidding discrimination against employees on account of their sex.
It ordered Rep. Bates to write letters of apology to Ms. Bertussi and to a second complainant, Karen Dryden. 

Rep. Bates said he would write the letters as ordered. "I accept the resolution of the matter by the Ethics Committee," he said. 

The panel also warned Rep. Bates that any further violations "may result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered." But Ms. Bertussi asked, "Who in their right mind is going to file another complaint with the Ethics Committee?" 

Rep. Bates has publicly begged for forgiveness from voters and was re-elected with 60% of the vote last November. 

Bank of New England Corp., seeking to streamline its business after a year of weak earnings and mounting loan problems, said it will sell some operations and lay off 4% of its work force. 

The bank holding company also reported that third-quarter profit dropped 41%, to $42.7 million, or 61 cents a share, from the year-earlier $72.3 million, or $1.04 a share. 

Among its restructuring measures, the company said it plans to sell 53 of its 453 branch offices and to lay off 800 employees.
Altogether, employment is expected to decline to less than 16,000 from the current level of about 18,000. 

Walter Connolly, chairman, said in an interview that the company expects to record pretax gains of $100 million to $125 million from the sale of its leasing operations and of certain financial processing services.
In a prepared statement, the company said it expects to realize those gains before year end. 

Nonperforming assets continued to pile up in the latest quarter, rising to $900 million, or 3.52% of loans and leases, from $667 million, or 2.68%, at the end of the second quarter.
Some $170 million of the $233 million increase in nonperforming loans was related to real estate, and roughly three-quarters of that was in the troubled New England market, according to Richard Driscoll, vice chairman. 

Mr. Driscoll said that, despite continued weakness in the region's real estate market, Bank of New England expects the rate of increase in nonperforming assets to slow in coming quarters.
Mr. Connolly noted that net third-quarter charge-offs, at $63 million, improved slightly from the $67 million in the second quarter.
And he indicated that more substantial improvement is expected in the next couple of quarters. 

The company increased its loan loss reserve to $354 million from $342 million at the end of the second quarter.
Total assets slipped to $31.4 billion, from $32 billion as of June 30. 

Among other restructuring measures, the bank said it will close its loan production offices in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia.
The Chicago office figured prominently in the bank's problems earlier this year, when $65 million in loans to Chicago businessman William Stoecker went sour. 

In an internal memorandum to employees, Messrs.
Connolly and Driscoll described the restructuring as an effort to continue rationalizing operations assembled during a series of mergers over the past five years. 

Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp. said they extended their offer for Connaught BioSciences Inc., valued at 866 million Canadian dollars (US$736 million) to Oct. 27. 

The companies earlier said they didn't want to raise their offer to match a rival bid by Institut Merieux S.A. of C$37 a share, or C$942 million.
But they said the C$30-a-share bid, which was due to expire Monday, may still be extended or varied. 

Merieux, a vaccine manufacturer based in Lyon, France, is 51%-held by French state-owned Rhone-Poulenc S.A. Ciba-Geigy is a major pharmaceutical concern based in Basel, Switzerland.
Chiron, another pharmaceutical concern, is based in Emeryville, Calif.
Connaught is a biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concern. 

Institut Merieux's bid for Toronto-based Connaught has run into problems with the Canadian government, which told Merieux last week that it wasn't convinced that the proposed acquisition would be of "net benefit" to Canada.
Merieux officials are expected to meet with federal officials in Ottawa today to discuss the decision. 

Cincinnati Microwave Inc. said it introduced two radar detectors. 

One unit, called the Escort, uses a new digital signal-processing technology to detect radar signals much sooner than was previously possible, the company said.
The other, called the Solo, is battery operated and is the first high-performance radar detector that doesn't need a power cord, the company said. 

AVX Corp. and Unitrode Corp. said they completed the previously reported sale of Unitrode's San Diego-based Passive Components division to AVX. AVX, a New York-based maker of passive electronic products, paid $11 million in cash to Unitrode, a Lexington-based maker of semiconductor products.
Passive Components makes capacitors and filters used to protect electronics. 

The public sector borrowing requirement, the most widely used measure of Britain's government deficit or surplus, showed a deficit of #200 million in September, compared with a deficit of #765 million in August and a deficit of #1.08 billion in September 1988, the Treasury said. 

In the six months since the current fiscal year began April 1, the surplus totaled #500 million, compared with a surplus of #3.6 billion in the year-earlier period. 

The government is projecting a #14 billion surplus for the fiscal year. 

The reported figures for the public sector borrowing requirement include receipts from the sale of state-owned industries.
Excluding those receipts, the government deficit would have totaled about #2.5 billion in the first six months, compared with #1.3 billion a year earlier, the Treasury said. 

Lionel Corp. 's board unanimously rejected a tender offer of $8 a share, or $95.4 million, for as much as 90% of Lionel by a group with a 9.9% stake in the toy retailer. 

Lionel also urged holders of its stock and debt not to tender their securities, saying it wants to remain independent to pursue its business strategy.
Lionel also said the offer by Robert I. Toussie Limited Partnership is inadequate, and full of conditions that leave it "subject to substantial uncertainty." 

In addition, Lionel began a lawsuit in federal District Court in New York seeking to enjoin the offer, alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities law and fraudulent manipulation of the market for Lionel's securities. 

Robert I. Toussie, general partner of the investment group, said the Lionel response reflected management's entrenched position, saying officials had failed to come up with a better alternative to his group's offer.
Mr. Toussie said he would respond to Lionel's suit after his lawyers review it. 

"The New Crowd" by Judith Ramsey Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld (Little, Brown, 444 pages, $19.95), describes the displacing of the old "our crowd" Jewish Wall Street banking grandees by such new business barons as Saul Steinberg, Carl Icahn, Sanford Weill and Bruce Wasserstein.
Its many lively stories include the Gutfreund-Postel holiday cheer imbroglio.
These two New Crowd families lived in the same apartment building, with the Postel penthouse perched on top of the Gutfreund duplex.
The penthouse elevator started up from the Gutfreund landing, and Susan Gutfreund used to turn off its light, to give the impression that there was no higher floor.
Eventually, Mr. Postel broke his toe in the dark. 

Then the Gutfreunds determined to put up a 22-foot Christmas tree, weighing a quarter of a ton, to amaze their holiday guests.
For this, a crane needed to be mounted on the Postels' terrace.
The Postels did not give permission.
But the Gutfreund workers went ahead anyway, only to be captured "in flagrante" by Joan Postel, who called the police. 

Before the Gutfreunds finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious duplex on Fifth Avenue and an 18th-century mansion with a specially excavated $1 million garage in Paris, the Postels had obtained an injunction to prevent any future hoisting of trees, and in a neighborly spirit hit both the Gutfreunds and the building with a $35 million lawsuit.
Nothing less, it seemed, could console them for their traumas. 

Where had all the money come from?
The young John Gutfreund had been discovered by Billy Salomon of Salomon Bros. when he was still a bearded liberal, and put to work as a trader, and then as a rough-and-tumble syndicator. " `Get off your . . .,' he would bellow," say the authors.
Rising in the firm, he became powerful and bland, though his new wife, Susan, made him shine in the gossip columns with her profligate spending habits and flamboyant frocks.
After he had been head of the company for 3 1/2 years, he and his partners sold it to Phibro, a powerful commodity trading outfit, for $550 million in Phibro stock.
Limited partner Billy Salomon, whose family name had been on the firm's door for 70 years and who had hoped it would be there forever, was not consulted.
Mr. Gutfreund collected $32 million, while Billy Salomon got $10 million, much less than if he had conducted the sale. "I felt betrayed," he later said.
Worse, Salomon's timing had been off.
Its profits, unlike Phibro's, soared over the next two years, and had it held out, Salomon could have gotten an even bigger bundle. 

The book also recounts the not dissimilar maneuvers surrounding the changing of the guard at Lehman Bros. and other grand old firms.
Often the genteel, conservative, long-term-oriented investment bankers were displaced by crude traders: "When angered, he cursed so forcefully that his face reddened and his pale-blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits," the authors say of Lehman's Lewis Glucksman. 

The earlier generation of "our crowd" bankers -- Belmonts, Warburgs, Lehmans, Baches and Schiffs -- had stressed above all probity, tradition, continuity and reputation.
They were old-fashioned elegant gentlemen, who happened to be of German Jewish extraction.
But in the harsh world of today's Wall Street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less scrupulous successors.
The cuckoo prefers the nests of other birds and heaves out their eggs.
But the old guard hired the New Crowd people: It brought in its own cuckoos.
So, as the Old Crowd toppled from the branch, it shouldn't have been too surprised. 

The old guard had every right, however, to disdain the newcomers' new ways of making money, such as greenmail. (A Fortune article on Saul Steinberg was entitled, "Fear and Loathing in the Corporate Boardrooms.") Their other staple has been corporate takeovers, often hostile and financed by junk bonds.
Hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon.
Sometimes they are constructive, but often not.
First, by making management focus on short-term results, they inhibit building for the future -- just the opposite of Japan.
Second, a long-term shareholder of a good company needn't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily: It will bounce back.
But if a raider takes over when the stock is weak, the shareholder never gets his recovery. 

The raiders, meanwhile, have evolved their own pattern for spending their new millions.
As described in "The New Crowd," they take on ambitious new wives, move to Greenwich, Conn., or Bedford, N.Y., buy OK pictures, and let their wives share the wealth with decorators.
Having donated heavily to museums, they demand a place on their boards. 

The book is patronizing about this nouveau riche struggle for respectability, which has its tawdry aspects.
However, on balance, the charity game helps America.
If those who have the money don't get involved with the museums and the charities, then City Hall will do it, badly.
It has been rightly observed that the main thing wrong with tainted money is, t'aint enough of it. 

A handful of the New Crowd operators have crossed the line from the immoral to the illegal, and have ended up in the slammer or paying huge fines: Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine, Martin Siegel, Victor and Steven Posner, and now Michael Milken and perhaps Leona Helmsley.
The glitzy office that Ivan Boesky vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators Marc Rich and "Pinky" Green, today fugitives from a potential century apiece of jail sentences. 

The Old Crowd is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this.
However, the phenomenon is not specifically Jewish.
It has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in, and that a few will cut corners in the process.
Some pretty seamy stuff built the turn-of-the-century families' Fifth Avenue and Newport palazzi and endowed their daughters' weddings to foreign noblemen.
Mr. Boesky was a piker compared to Jay Gould and Jim Fiske, and Commodore Vanderbilt thought nothing of bribing judges and legislators.
So who knows?
In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability, perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors.
Or perhaps Wall Street, when it has suffered enough, will realize that finance is a service industry, and change its ethos.

Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the House version in advance of a House-Senate conference broke down. 

House leaders had hoped to follow the Senate's lead by getting an agreement from House committee chairmen under which they would drop items that wouldn't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the House-passed bill before the negotiations with the Senate began. 

But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues, ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance. "Many members feel there are important features of the House bill that should be enacted," Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said. "If there is any support for reducing the bill, it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form." 

Now those items will be discussed in a House-Senate conference, which could begin as soon as today, with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation. "You've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out," said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.). "This is a democratic process -- you can't slam-dunk anything around here." 

White House Budget Director Richard Darman has said he would continue to press to keep the capital-gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the House drops many of its costly provisions. 

Senate leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to President Bush by the end of the week, but Speaker Foley said that wasn't likely. 

Failure to pass the bill meant that $16.1 billion in across-the-board spending cuts took effect Monday under the Gramm-Rudman budget law.
The bill must be enacted before the cuts can be restored. 

Egon Krenz, the man tapped yesterday to become East Germany's new leader, faces the same task that has fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues: reforming a country in crisis.
But unlike the other new leaders in the East Bloc, Mr. Krenz will face an immediate threat to his nation's very existence: German reunification. 

Mr. Krenz, age 52, is known as an old-guard ironfist, one likely to continue the method of running a country that the Berlin Wall made famous.
Even if he were to change his stripes and become another Milton Friedman, however, he would still stand a good chance of losing a country. 

Mr. Krenz almost certainly will be a younger version of Erich Honecker, his rigid predecessor as dictator.
Mr. Krenz has followed much the same career path as Mr. Honecker: Both spent years overseeing the Freie Deutsche Jugend, the youth group that is the communist regime's principal tool for stamping young Germans into socialist citizens.
More recently, Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security, and is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo. 

Faced with another Mr. Honecker, so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German peoples will get their reunification, de facto, on West German ground.
But if East Germany's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough to permit Mr. Krenz to make serious efforts at reform, he will face a challenge just as fundamental.
Abandoning socialism means abandoning the East German state's reason for existence, and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall.
In this scenario it's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the Federal Republic could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie -- economic, federal or stronger -- with West Germany. 

Mr. Krenz may need a bit of time to consolidate his empire, which would do a lot to promote Reunification Scenario One.
Cartoonists in West Germany have already mocked the exodus by imagining an advertisement placed by Mr. Honecker: "Wanted: one people." The West German embassies in Prague, Budapest and Warsaw are continuing to find refugees at their gates. 

Of course East Germany, true to its tradition, could tighten its borders yet further.
Two of the last gestures of the Honecker regime were to close the border to Czechoslovakia and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier.
But with world-wide opinion -- even, apparently in Moscow -- against East Germany, the country would have to turn itself into an Albania to clamp down further on refugees. 

There have been some reports that Mr. Krenz is moving to "soften" his reputation, notably rumors that it was he who kept East Germany's state police off protesters' backs at the country's dismal 40th anniversary celebrations earlier this month.
But even if he effects a Hyde-to-Jekyll transformation, he will face a serious ideological crisis and Reunification Scenario Two. 

The problem is one that East Germany shares with other half-states, such as North Korea, but one it must shoulder alone in the East Bloc.
When Poland moves to reform, it can at least lean on its past: However flawed and short-lived Joseph Pilsudski's interwar republic, it was a nonsocialist democracy.
Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country.
Even the Soviet Union has Peter the Great to rediscover, should it choose to.
But East Germany is merely "the land of truly existing socialism." Beyond that, it has to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity.
Up to now, the main weapon of the "worker and peasant state" has been the ideology of socialism. 

With talk today of a second economic miracle in West Germany, East Germany no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league.
Without Moscow's military and party behind it, East Germany runs the risk of disintegrating.
If it goes capitalist, and increases trade with West Germany, it will convert itself, willy-nilly, into an economic annex of the Federal Republic.
There's a certain cruel logic at work here: It's particularly appropriate -- and tragic -- that the land that produced Karl Marx should prove socialism's failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls. 

There may be forces that would delay this scenario.
Ideologues are the last to surrender, and Germans are an ideological people.
The protesters who greeted Mikhail Gorbachev at East Berlin's airport earlier this month weren't shouting "Go U.S.A" -- they were chanting "Gorby, Help Us."

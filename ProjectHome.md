> [Sentence boundary disambiguation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_boundary_disambiguation) (SBD) is the problem in natural language processing of deciding where the beginning and ends of sentences are.

Detecting sentence boundary is one of the most important function in [NLP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)(natural language processing) area. like language morphological analyzer, [part-of-speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech) tagger. We usually use delimiters or punctuations to segment phrase or document. but problem is the accuracy of sentence boundary. So i would like to create two types of sentence boundary detector that are rule based SBD(sentence boundary detector) and machine learning based SBD.
